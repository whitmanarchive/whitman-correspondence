    "text": "Washington, D.C.July 25, 1885.Dear Walt: I hope your stroke of exhaustion from the heat was not as serious as the newspaper made it seem. I always make allowance for the reporter. The weather here for ten days past has been as bad as the Soudan's Torrid. At this moment (Sunday afternoon) the clouds have gathered heavily, and the thunder is rumbling so I suppose relief is coming. I have had a strange illness lately, but hope I am getting better. It took the form of utter weakness, and for a fortnight I barely had the use of my legs, and tumbled down on the slightest provocation. I began to wonder whether I was going to match you. The doctor, however, says it will pass if I take great care of myself, requiring me to keep as quiet as possible. I suppose it comes form my being much run down. I am glad you liked the photo. It is a good likeness, and quite powerful as a picture. That Bacon is a great success. If I could only get a steel engraving! This is only a wood cut, and probably does small justice to Vandyk's portrait. The resemblance to the ideal pictures of Shakespeare is remarkable—I think, prophetic.—Donnelly writes me that the cipher is coming out gloriously. It is a complete narrative of Bacon's life and times, regularly underlying the text of the plays, and settles the Bacon-Shakespeare question conclusively. William will have to step down and out for good. I laugh when I think of the chagrin of the Shakespeareans, who have been so insolent and intolerant, and suppressed evidence with a high hand. Donnelly, when he was here, got quite intimate with me, explained the law of the cipher, and read me a good deal of the translation. The cipher is by regular rule, which will stop the mouth of any caviller. It is as simple and indisputable as twice two are four, but terribly laborious to decipher, the process being one of continual counting of words. I am amazed at the revolutionary daring of the device on the part of Bacon. You will be surprised to see how the corruption of the text is accounted for. In every case, so far, where the sense is in doubt, it is explained by the sacrifice of some word to the exigencies of the cipher. Doubtless the cipher will end by telling us where the original true manuscripts are hidden, which I will bet are in the Shakespeare monument (not grave) at Stratford. The scene in the cipher where Bacon to save the life of his servant, Henry Percy, acknowledges to Queen Elizabeth his own authorship of Richard Second and the other plays up to that date, is tremendously striking. She calls him, \"Thou damned beast,\" clutches him by the beard and beats him with her crutch. No wonder that Essex meant to stab the old termagant (as Bacon calls her in the cipher) with his own hand—habitually inflicting such indignities on the great men around her. Essex himself got a blow in the face from her.—All the account of Shakespeare's raid on Sir Thomas Lucy's park; his flight to London; his appearance, ragged and barefooted, in front of the Red Bull theatre, bawling for horses to hold, where Bacon first saw him, is quite rich. \"A good-tempered, ragged wretch,\" is Bacon's description of him. The bit from the \"Journal of Commerce\" which young Johann sent you, shows that we still live. There was quite a blast for me lately in the Boston \"Advertiser\"—very friendly, but full of the oddest errors, as, for example, where he makes me very finicky about spelling my name with only one n (!!) and has me as librarian of the Department, etc. C. W. E. sent the \"Journal of Commerce\" a list of the poems written about you, requested by its correspondent. I get the papers you send, including the Tribune with Smalley's letter about Victor Hugo, written with his usual admirable talent and deformed, as usual, by his meanness. He is the meannest man living. I always used to say he could be parsed—positive Small, comparative Smaller, superlative Smalley! Victor Hugo's death much weakened my appetite for life. I read with interest what he said about Shakespeare, but the criticism about his indifference to the lower classes does not touch me as true. It never appears to be remarked, that of all the wise, compassionate, sympathetic men of that age, not one spoke up for the poor and downtrodden. Why? Because they could not! Victor Hugo in that age would have had to be silent. One single line in a scene expressing even latent sympathy with the Jack Cades or Wat Tylers, would have sent its author at once to the block, and the play itself would have been suppressed even before it had appeared, so watchful and relentless was the censorship. To realize the bloody, brassy, wanton rigor of the military despotism then in power, one has only to note the treatment Raleigh got. The government was simply infernal—almost inconceivable. The only thing the illuminati of that day could do was to set about the slow sap of the monarchy. This was the only way they could rehabilitate the commons. To alter your sense a little—\"the indirect is as great and real as the direct\"—and the indirect was their only weapon or implement. I too heard lately from Dr. Bucke, urging me to visit him. I wish you could go up there, but have no doubt you are prudent to stay near home. Mrs. Gilchrist sent me a copy of the \"Today.\" I have really not had the strength or mind to read what she has written—I have been so ill and feeble—but intend to soon. I have no doubt her article is good, and when I have read it, I mean to write her my thanks. I have an awful pile of unanswered letters. Decapitation, of which you ask, seems impending, and I am anxiously thinking what field will be open to me, when I am shoved out of here. There have been several people after my position already. I wish you could get stronger in your legs. It would be such a comfort to be able to move about freely. I wrote an article defending Mrs Pott's book from Richard Grant White, and bringing out several vital points in the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy. It was rejected by several magazines, but finally accepted by the Manhattan, the editor, Forman, being immensely taken with it. He held it a long time, hoping the magazine would resume, and surrendered it with evident reluctance and regret. Now I propose to bring it out in a book or brochure, and have written to McKay offering it to him. If you are in the way of seeing him, give me a boost. I think, considering the general interest just now in the question, it might really have some sale. Since I began the change has come. Last night we had a tremendous rain, and today it continued, though moderately. It is a blessed relief. (Today means Monday, the 27th.) Good bye. With best wishes and hopes,Yours always faithfully,W.D.O'Connor.Walt Whitman.see notes Feb 1st 1889 William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 25 July 1885"
