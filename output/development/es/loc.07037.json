    "text": "[London, Ontario]4 Dec [188]6My dear WaltThe \"After All\" parcel came to hand last evening to my great relief for I had almost given it up and had written to Washington about it. I see it was returned to you for more stamps. Thank you very much for the new (1886) portrait, I like it very much & thanks too for the facsimile letter with English list of contributors. I have the Centenial ed. both of L of G. & 2 Riv. (sent on last order) but nothing further so far. You know I asked you also for L. of G. author's Ed. 1882—also current Ed. of L. of G. & specimen days, also for any thing you might have and be willing to part with earlier than 1870— By the way I want, both '71 and '72 L of G. but I do not think you have them. I have sent to McKay for some portraits for Harry Forman and myself and have told McKay when he has them collected to send them over to you to be signed and dated. I hope you will kindly do this for me. Is the new portrait for \"Autumn Boughs\"? and are you thinking of bringing that book out soon. I hope so. Do not forget that you are to be ready to move in May bag & baggage & make your calculations accordingly. Mercury fell to zero here this morning, a lovely bright morning—good sleighing here now. Remember me very kindly to Mrs Stafford & all the family when you see them—Has Harry had his neck attended to yet?Please send on the book as soon as convenient.Always AffectionatelyR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 December 1886"
