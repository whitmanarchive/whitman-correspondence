We thought he was dying Saturday night for a time. I had to go after the doctor about 12 o'clock you must come down as soon as you get this letter, come down on the 4 train from PhilaPhiladelphia tomorrow if you can any how I will have to close for the present.Ever yoursHarry Stafford Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 13 November 1877"
