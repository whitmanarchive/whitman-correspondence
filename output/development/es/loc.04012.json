Still keep the sick chair & sick room—(now going into the sixth month)—The big book , (my whole works in one Vol.) will be bound now in a week or ten days—I suppose Eva bro't you the little Nov: Boughs—Things go on comfortably with me—Eat & sleep fairly—spirits good yet—Sunny cold weather here—Herbert comes quite often—Two visitors ladies strangers just here to see me—love to you, dear boy, & to Eva and Dora—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 21 November 1888"
