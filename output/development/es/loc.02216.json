    "text": "The Critic52 & 54 Lafayette PlaceNew York\"Bellevue\"Bordentown, N. J.13 June 1890Dear W. Whitman:Nearly a month ago I sent you a request to vote (as a member of The Critic's Academy of Forty Immortals) for nine successors to the members deceased since our leaders elected the Forty in 1884. I sent a list of about 65 unsuccessful candidates (or rather nominees) who were voted for at that time, + asked you to pick out nine of them or to name nine others if you preferred. Nearly all the \"Academicians\" have sent in their votes; but I don't want to announce the result of the thing till I hear from you. If you have lost the printed slip, I can send you another. We shall not tell how any individual voted, but only how they all votedâ€”the net result. I hope you'll not disappoint us.Sincerely yours,J. B. Gilder Joseph B. Gilder to Walt Whitman, 13 June 1890"
