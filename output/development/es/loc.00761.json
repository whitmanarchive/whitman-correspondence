    "text": "Buffaloâ€”12 Jany 1863 Dear Sir,I am very sorry to be so late with my reply to your note, which was received by me just on leaving home to go to Canada, & thence to some of your West N.Y. cities, a journey which has left me no leisure for writing notes to diplomatists, until today. If you wish to live in that least attractive (to me) of cities, I must think you can easily do so. Perhaps better in the journalism than in the Departments. You will see that I have dated my note from my known residence. With best hope,R. W. EmersonWalt Whitman, Esq. Ralph Waldo Emerson to Walt Whitman, 12 January 1863"
