    "text": "56 Easton Sq. N.W.17 Aug.Dear Whitman,This day I have obtained a P.O. order for £4.12. payable to you. The order (as you are aware) does not pass thro' my own hands.Of the £4.12, half is the money of Mr. Cozens, to whom you have already sent the books. The other half is from a new subscriber, Jas. Anderson Rose, 11 Salisbury St., London, W.C.—He is a solicitor of some note, once Under-Sheriff of London, brother of an Alderman who has been Lord Mayor; is besides a great collector of engravings & other works of artistic (or literary) interest. He does not know your writings, but seems sincerely desirous of making some acquaintance with them.Wd.Would you kindly tell Mrs. Gilchrist that I have by me a letter of hers (undated) wh.which was presented to me a month or so ago by a Mr. Carpenter—who paid two long visits at my house, & whom I liked much, obtaining from him numerous details that interested me extremely regarding yourself & the Gilchrists. I wdwould have written to Mrs. G before now, but for incessant occupations, & in the last 2 mos.months much anxiety regarding my brother's state of health. He was lately in a bad way, requiring a severe surgical operation; &, thothough that went off rightly, he does not rally adequately, & I feel by no means confident as to the final result. One great object has been to get him out of town to some suitable seaside house: I am in hopes that today this will be accomplished, more or less well. Please also tell Mrs. G that a son was born to me on 28 Feb: he & the little girl (thothough the boy did at one time alarm us much) go on well, & are at present with their mamma at Gorleston near Yarmouth.With all affection to you & the Gilchrist family,Ever truly yours,Wm. Rossetti.I shdshould have said that the £4.12. was the only money now actually in my hands on your account. Have not heard from Dowden since I wrote you last.Excuse this hurried & scrappy note. William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 17 August [1877]"
