    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Tuesday noon, Feb. 19, 1867. Dearest mother,Well, mother, Jeff has been to see me at last—he left yesterday morning—I wish he could have staid a few days longer—He seemed to be well pleased with his visit, & I am sure it was a great comfort to me—I rather like my new quarters—at any rate they are better than where I was previously—they are very good on some accounts, & not so good on others—but one must not expect perfection. When you write tell me how Jeff got home—We are having pleasant weather here now—the ice & snow are all gone—Mother, do you see the papers much? I can send papers to you, only they would be rather old by the time you get them. Well, mother, I left my letter awhile, & have been out taking a walk, & now return & finish my letter—It is quite like summer—I looked for an Almanac but couldn't find any to suit me—I am going out to Georgetown, & will find one there—I will send it to-morrow—The O'Connors are much pleased with Jeff—Mrs. O'Connor has taken a real liking to him—I hope this will find you relieved of your rheumatism—I send my love to Matty & George & all.Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 19 February 1867"
