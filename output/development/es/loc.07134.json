    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon16 Dec 1890I have yours of 13th I do not like that abdominal pain continuing so long and I do not like those darting pains you mention. I have written to Horace about it and have told him to arrange to have some good doctor from Phila come over and see what you need. I hope you will not make any difficulty about this reasonable stop. If the Dr. does you no good he certainly will do you no harm. I am much disappointed at what you tell me about the new glasses and I think you would be wrong to lay them aside as you seem to be doing—if they are not right they should be altered and if they are right they should be worn. Thomas & Fox gave me the glasses I have on at present—for a week ortwo they gave me a great annoyance, even distress, but I stuck to them as Thomas told me and they have been a real comfort to me since.I have just read \"Old Poets\" again for the third or fourth time—it grows upon me somehow—I like it better—you have (of course) said it all before (and more than once) but there is no harm in saying it again in slightly varied language—the language of the article is certainly admirable and what it says and suggests is important enough to hear almost any amount of repetitionWith best loveYour friendRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 December 1890"
