    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden New JerseyMay 29 '81My dear Mr OsgoodI suppose you rec'dreceived the copy yesterday (Saturday) as I sent it the previous day. You already have my plan—a volume of say 400 pages, (not over 450) handy size, first class (but I know you wouldn't issue any other) in paper, print, binding &c: but markedly plain & simple even to Quakerness—I have a desire that all through even in capitalization, punctuation &c it shall be so—no sensationalism or luxury—a well made book for honest wear & use & carrying with you—to retail at $3—The book has not hitherto been really published at all—the issues have been reconnoisancesreconnaissances—printings in proof for zealous friends &c.The British market is an important consideration.The copy I sent will have to be returned before very long to me, for complete minor & technical revision, as I did not wait to finish it after receiving your last letter.But I reserve any thing further until I hear your definite decision on the main point—the publication—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to James R. Osgood, 29 May 1881"
