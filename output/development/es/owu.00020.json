    "text": "28 MarchFriday morning—9 o'clockDearest mother,The sun shines out bright & cheerful this morning—& in my east window I have a fine healthy rose-bush—I see it has got two roses in bloom, & one just budding out—(it was a present from Mrs. Channing of Providence—she sent on here, and had it got for me, when I was first sick)—I think I am feeling better to-day, & more like myself—I have been in the habit of soaking my feet in hot water every night for two months now—& I think lately it has done me more harm than good—one thing is, it has probably made me catch a slight cold—so I have stoptstopped it, & I have a notion I feel better from stopping it——I have just had my breakfast, & am sitting here alone by the stove, writing this—Charles Eldridge will be here in a few minutes, & bring the morning papers—he comes & sits a few minutes every morning before going to work—he has been very good indeed—he & Peter Doyle hold out through every thing—most of the rest have got tired & stoptstopped coming—(which is just as well)—Mrs. O'Connor comes whenever she can, & generally brings a dish of roast apples, or something—I go over to the office about 12 or 1 most every day——but only for a few minutes—have not resumed work there yet, but hope to, Monday—I find there is a great deal of paralysis around, and they say I have got along very well—but it [is] so slow, so aggravating, to be disabled, so feeble, cannot walk nor do any thing, when one's mind & will are just as clear as ever—Still I feel I shall get as well as usual yet, dearest mother—& then I shall surely get here or buy or build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you & Ed and me—I realize it more, far more now, than ever—even for my own comfort—this spring is better to buy here than usual——I think we could get along very well indeed—you could visit George & Lou as often as you liked (& George & Lou could come & pay us a visit in winter when Congress is in full blast)——I miss John & Mrs. Burroughs—they are at a place called Waukill, N.Y. state—they have hired out their house furnished, 6 mo'smonths, $50 a month. I have not heard any thing further from Jeff—I hope to come on soon & pay you all a visit, but wait to see how things go in the office—& how I feel—(as I have been absent now nine weeks)—Every thing looks pleasant here to-day—quite spring like—Mother dear I hope this will find you feeling well, & in good spirits, as that is the main thing. —Mother as I cannot get down to the p.o. I send the money once more enclosed—write me Sunday, if convenient—Chas.Charles Eldridge has been in—it is now later, towards 12—I have washed & put on some clean clothes, & am going over to the office—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [28 March 1873]"
