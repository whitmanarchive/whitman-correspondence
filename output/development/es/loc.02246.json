    "text": "The Mount Lodge.St Leonard.6. 3. 88.Dear Sir,Inspired by a perusal of some of your Leaves of Grass, especially \"Starting from Paumanok,\" \"Song of the Open Road\" & \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, I dashed off the enclosed Sonnet, which I take the liberty of send to you, the rather to gratify my own pride, than to expect that you will esteem such a faulty production to be an honour. However I think it better to leave it as it is—To a Prophet.Whitman, thy earnest cries have reached our shore,Thou prophet of the old, & new En-masse—From world to world the glorious tidings pass,Of which down-trodden mortals scarce beforeDid dream, or if they did, with fire and goreRaised Hell on Earth by setting class 'gainst class;Thus crushing Freedom at her birth, alas!And ripping up the mother that her bore.But thou dost teach a common Brotherhood,The Present joins the Past, the East the West,And from their union springs a perfect brood,Bound, by the sacred ties of Comradeship,To purify our Earth from Error's pest,Till her last Sun in waves Eternal dip.I hope you will not consider me to be taking a liberty, but merely to be paying a somewhat antiquated tribute (spontaneously) to the honour of a great genius.Yours respectfully,W.J. Hensley\"I dream'd in a dream I saw a city invincibleto the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth,I dream'd that was the new city of Friends.\" W. J. Hensley to Walt Whitman, 3 June 1888"
