    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,10 Sept 1888How do the fates serve you these last few lovely days? Well I hope. We are all well here and the meter goes on quietly and well as far as we know. Nothing fresh however. The autumn weather here is just perfect, sunshiny, hazy, dreamy. Puts me in mind all the time of Tennyson's \"Lotos Eaters.\" How goes the book—I hope to get a perfect autograph copy both of N.B. & C.W. from you before a very great while—I shall look upon them as the crown and summit of all my W.W. Collection—a collection by the way which gives me a lot of worry sometimes to think what I am eventually to do with it. I regard it as so precious that no ordinary disposition of it will do—I am sorry to hear that Kennedy's book is not to be out at present—I fear it is quite a disappointment to him.I am going to write an elaborate annual report this year mostly on \"alcohol\" am in the middle of it—expect to give the alcohol men a \"black eye\"Affectionately yoursRM BuckeSee notes Sept. 11, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 10 September 1888"
