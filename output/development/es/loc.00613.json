May it never be severed by an unloyaldisloyal act of mine, let our password be \"Goodwill,\" and when called upon to sunder all earthly ties, when the last \"long roll\" is called in which there will be no \"missing\" may we be found in the ranks of the Captain of our Salvation, ready to enter upon an eternity of bliss and where parting is no more.I shall be pleased to see you when in our city, and in anything that I can contribute to your happiness in all things command me.With Many Regards, Respectfully YoursHugh B. Thomson.212 Canal St Hugh B. Thomson to Walt Whitman, 13 December 1866"
