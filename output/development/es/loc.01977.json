    "text": "STEAM PRINTING WORKSRemoved from177. GT. BRUNSWICK STREET74 Middle Abbey St.StreetDublin, 18/21876My dear, Mr WhitmanI send you an order for 39/‑ for a copy of your works the #10 edition. If the amount does not cover the cost of mailing pray let me know I will send it. Hope you will write your name in the volumes.Hear of you occasionally through Mr. Dowden. You may suppose that I often dwell with pleasure upon that little work I paid you in Washington now nearly 4 years ago.I wish you could see all the people—all the free young men, and pure women—here who take pleasure in & have received life & light from your books— Not that they are very numerous, but I think you would take grater pleasure from the kind of people who care for you than the numberI wish you cdcould have been at, or that I could be pictured to you, a meeting of a literary society I attended last Monday evening where a \"gentleman\" made a most ignorant & savage attack on your writings. I wish you cdcould have heard Professor Dowdens[Downden's] reply—I wish you could have seen how his beautifully spiritual face lighted up as he proceeded—and leading intelligently & with feelings the very same pages from your works which the lecturer (a coarse Man of the world) had read as words—make all clear & beautiful where was before coarse workings. I must say that I only know Mr Dowden casually—a person of my world cannot aspire to much acquaintance with a man whom I know to be so much in advance of me in every respect. My knowledge of literature is very High—I have not the critical insight into things that he hasDear friend, I am sorry to hear of your not being well. Is there no chance of our ever seeing you at ? I hope I will again see you in any case. Life appears to me increasingly beautiful & interesting—I feel increasingly tender towards all living creatures. My having been obliged to give up all idea of a separate life for myself beyond the grave, forces me more & more & more to do what little good I can in this world—convinces me more that (beyond our animal necessities) spiritual life, that truth, that intercourse with the pure hearted amongst us here—is the only life really worth living—I must not exclude the pure joys of nature—the , the mountain top, and the forest.Ever yours affectionately>With best wishesAlfred WebbFeb.February '76Alfred Webb,DublinSent books by mail March 11 '76 Alfred Webb to Walt Whitman, 18 February 1876"
