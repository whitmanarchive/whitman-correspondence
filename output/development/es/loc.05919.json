    "text": "[London, Ontario,]5th April [188]5Dear WaltI did not much think you wdwould care to go in for the Consul business. Well that being disposed of I want you to turn your attention seriously to coming here for the Summer. My plan is that sometime (any time) before the 1st June John Burroughs should run down to Philadelphia and take you to Esopus then about 1st June I would go to Esopus and come on here. We all want you and will undertake to make you comfortable for the summer and for the winter too if you will stay. It is likely you will hear from Burroughs before very long and when you do let me know how the project strikes youMrs Bucke wishes me to send her love to youI am affectionately yoursR M BuckeI am still taking \"The Critic\" so saw the article and like it much. You did not mention before the change in your housekeeping arrangements but Mr Smith said something to me in a letter about it. I am glad to hear that you are more comfortable but hope that that fact will not decide you to stay home all summer instead of coming here as you ought to do—I have had no more of the Round Table series since I sent the last to you—it is time some more were comingR M B. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 April 1885"
