    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,Oct. 27, 1866. Mrs. Price, & allMy dear friends,I sent you a telegram, ten minutes ago, telling you that I have just succeeded in getting an order from the Attorney General for Mr. Parker's pardon. The pardon will probably go from here, (from the State Department,) on Monday next—the day you will receive this note—it will be directed to the Jail at Plymouth. I have had much more of a struggle than I anticipated—the pardon clerk knew the case, & was filled with Mr. Dana's reports upon it. When we meet, (or perhaps by letter, before) I will give you a more detailed account of the progress of the affair here, & its fluctuations. But no matter—it has ended successfully.I have written to Aurelia Parker, & sent the news, the same mail as this.I am fearfully well—indeed so red & fat that people stop in the street & gaze at me.In the office, & my work, every thing goes on as usual. We are having delicious weather, coolish & bright. Has Arthur gone, then? Well you will value him all the more, when you have him again.Helen & Emmy, my dear friends, I send you my best love—Go over & see my mother when you can—Best remembrance to Mr. Arnold—also to Mr. Price. Walt Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 27 October 1866"
