    "text": "1 Torriano GardensCamden Rd.LondonDec 4, 1875.Though it is but a few days since I posted a letter my dearest friend, I must write you again—because I cannot help it, my heart is so full—so full of love & sorrow and struggle. The day before yesterday I saw Mr. Conway's printed account of you, & instead of the cheerful report I had been told of, he speaks of your having given up hope of recovery. Those words were like a sharp knife plunged into me They choked me with bitter tears. Dont[Don't] give up that hope, for the sake of those that so tenderly passionately love you—would give their lives with joy for you. Why who knows better than you, how much hope & the will have to do with it & I know quite well that the belief does not depress you—that you are ready to accept either lot with calmness, cheerfulness, perfect faith, perhaps with equal joy. But for all that, it does you harm. Ideas always have a tendency to accomplish themselves. And what right have the doctors to utter gloomy prophecies? The wisest of them know the best how profoundly in the dark they are as to much that goes on within us, especially in maladies like yours. (O cling to life with a resolute hold my beloved to bless us with your presence unspeakably dear beneficent presence—me to taste of it before so very long now—thirsting pining loving me. Take through these poor words of mine some breath of tender tender ineffable love that fills my heart and soul and body take of it to strengthen the very springs of your life: it is capable of that. O its cherishing warmth and joy, if it could only get to you, only fold you round close enough would help I know. Soon soon as ever my boy has one to love & care for him all his own, I will come, I may not before, not if it should break my heart to stop away from you, for his welfare is my sacred charge & nearer & dearer than all to me verily my God strengthen me, comfort me, stay for me—let that have a little beginning on this dear earth which is for all eternity which will live & grow immortally into a diviner reality than the heart of man has conceived.I am well satisfied with Norah dear Friend. She is very affectionate, loveable, prudent & clear in all practical matters, well suited to Percy in tastes, &c. Your ownAnnie. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 4 December 1875"
