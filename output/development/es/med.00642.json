    "text": "I have just received your card, dated 28th September, and I am very glad to hear that you have had so pleasant a summer, and that you are in better health. Long may you remain so, say I. Did you receive a letter I sent you some weeks ago, asking you to write four or six lines in an MS. poem by Walter Scott? Not hearing from you, I fear you have not received it. If you have not received it, may I send it to you again, when I will explain my wishes? It will only occupy you for five minutes. I spent a very pleasant hour yesterday with Lowell. We smoked the pipe of good-fellowship. Tennyson is in Sussex, quite well. I shall send him your card.Yours,F. Locker. Frederick Locker-Lampson to Walt Whitman, 13 October 1880"
