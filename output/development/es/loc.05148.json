    "text": "Sept. 27th.28 Terrassen Ufer. Dresden'83My dear MasterI got your post card last Tuesday morning. I had not written for some time because I waited till I had something to say about the essay on the L. of G.Leaves of Grass I was preparing for delivery here. They had promised me an earlier date for it, but could not, in the end, find one till the 25th Sept. last, the day I got your card on. It (i.e. the lecture) was delivered before the Dresden Literary Society, consisting mostly of Professors & savants of all kinds. No one knew anything, or anything beyond the name, of you, except Dr. Doehn, the author of a history of American Literature I told you of. He spoke on my essay, and took the usual line of intelligent and book-learned persons, thus—\"He is a poet by God's grace—but that is all\" (and it isn't much, according to Dr. D.) \"He is wanting in two indispensable requisites for a great writer. (1) Knowledge—(2) Form.\" As to the absence of knowledge, I can only conjecture that he meant that your poems would not be regarded as historical studies, like Schillers 'Tell' &c. Two others spoke—one a Dr. Hohlfeld, a man of much genuine thoughtfulness. He merely pointed out some philosophical parallels between things I had said, and passages of Schiller & Schleiermacher. A third speaker said a few words which showed that he understood my drift—among other things he said what I had reported about you reminded him of Wordsworth. Now this was really remarkable, for I had always held that Wordsworth was the true predecessor of the L. of G.Leaves of Grass & on asking Edward Dowden once about this, he fully confirmed what I had thought. (\"Wordsworth is calculated to lead a courageous, though not a timid, person up to W.W.\") Yet in writing my essay, I had no thought of him, nor had mentioned him.—Now it so happens that another English friend here has, about a year ago, delivered a lecture before the same Literary Soc.Society on Wordsworth. And we mean now to publish both lectures together with a short preface showing in what direction the connection between you & Wordsworth is to be looked for. I will send you some copies as soon as this appears, which will be without delay. As to my translation of the L. of G.Leaves of Grass I am now ready to cooperate with any competent German, i.e. I have got a good way in the actual rendering, & see how it is to be done, &c. & all I want is a colleague to push on the work energetically with. But nothing of the kind has as yet turned up (although intelligent & more or less sympathetic readers in sufficient number.) Now do you know anyone whom you could put in connection with me? It does not strike me as needful that he should live in this town. We could easily arrange some system of work, through the post, & meet if necessary some time? Perhaps my essay when published may lead to something. I got Dr. Bucke's book. He was kind enough to send me a copy (I hope my letter of acknowledgment did not fail to reach him). I think it will be of the greatest service for all time (giving permanent expression to facts of great interest & importance, but the theoretic part of it not going deep enough.) I will send him my essay when it appears.Nothing more to say now. Very glad to hear that you keep well.Yours alwaysT. W. Rolleston Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 27 September 1883"
