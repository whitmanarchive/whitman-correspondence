    "text": "WashingtonApril 23, 1870Dear Charles Stoddard,I received some days since your affectionate letter, & presently came your beautiful & soothing South Sea Idyll which I read at once. Now, as I write, I sit by a large open window, looking south & west down the Potomac & across to the Virginia heights. It is a bright, warm spring-like afternoon. I have just re-read the sweet story all over, & find it indeed soothing & nourishing after its kind, like the atmosphere. As to you, I do not of course object to your emotional & adhesive nature, & the outlet thereof, but warmly approve them—but do you know (perhaps you do,) how the hard, pungent, gritty, worldly experiences & qualities in American practical life, also serve? how they prevent extravagant sentimentalism? & how they are not without their own great value & even joy? It arises in my mind, as I write, to say something of that kind to you—I am not a little comforted when I learn that the young men dwell in thought upon me & my utterances—as you do—& I frankly send you my love—& I hope we shall one day meet——I wish to hear from you always,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Charles Warren Stoddard, 23 April 1870"
