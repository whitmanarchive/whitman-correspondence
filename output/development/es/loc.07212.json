    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANE,LONDON, ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,15 June 1888Since reaching home Wednesday evening I have had my hands pretty full and have still enough to keep me out of mischeif. The accounts from Pardee in Sarnia are not very good and I shall go there tomorrow evening to have a look at him. I have heard nothing yet from Harned or Trauble[Traubel] since I left Camden but there has hardly been time—hope to get a card this evening—I have found time to write the circular and give it to the printer, I will send you a proof early in the week—but mind you are not supposed to see it however you may as well and perhaps you would suggest a verbal change or two—if you feel like it do so.If we get plenty of money (as I confidently hope) as a result of this circular it may be that you would not care to issue the $5. book, as we spoke of, but that is a matter to consider later. Our grounds here are perfectly lovely. I wish I could drive you about them—the weather is charming here—I have in front of me, on my desk, here in my office an enormous bouquet of snowballs, peonies, sweet flag &cLove to youRM BuckeI have gone through \"A Backward Glance\" and think it by far the most valuable of all the explanatory pieces you have written. My opinion (not that it is worth any thing) is that this book of yours ought to have a sale and I think it should be published at a quite reasonable price—say $1. or $1.25 to encourage this—if it should sell it would no doubt introduce many new people to L.of G.Mail in—no word from Camden. I hope you are not worseRMB Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 15 June 1888"
