    "text": "See notes Sept 1 1888Belmont MassAug. 30 '88Dear Walt Whitman:—I long,—and have lang syne & every day longed—to know some details of yryour days now. For some reason Mr Traubel has never seen fit to tell me any thing about your daily doings—whether you sit up or whether you are prone on yryour back. It is cruel to keep a fellow ignorant. Can't you tell me in a line or two yourself? Thank you for the magazine—\"Bookmaker\"—with its picture of you. Herbert Gilchrist has sent me a proof of what seems to me the best of the two photogravures of Mrs Gilchrist. I prize it highly. Any news from the three—Bucke, O.'C. or J.B.?I am reading with tremendous interest & absorption (by bits as I get time) Scott's best novels again, & looking up all the hard Scotch words in Jamieson's Dictionary. They have made my summer glorious. My love of that man is something strong as fate. Indeed I believe the ties of blood draw me to him & Scotland—my \"forbears\" being Scotch-Irish (on one side). I am now revelling in the \"Antiquary\" wh. I opine to be the healthiest & most humorous of all, perhaps.yrsyours affect as ever.W.S. Kennedysee notes Sept 1, 1888 William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 30 August 1888"
