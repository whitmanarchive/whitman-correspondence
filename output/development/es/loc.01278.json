It seems to me to rank with the very best of your poems, and that it is sure to last.I am sorry to say that it comes too late to be put as the second article & will need to be put in one of the later signatures. But wherever it is, it cannot be hidden.You shall have the proof promptly.I am very truly YoursF. P. Church.Walt Whitman Francis Pharcellus Church to Walt Whitman, 8 August 1867"
