    "text": "Beka an der Ilm,17 July 1875.My dear Walt Whitman,I write you these lines from a little village two mile's from Weimar, where I have visited the Tombs of Goethe and Schiller and felt all the great recollection awaken. I have had a great deal of fulsome labors this spring and now I am seeking refreshment between the pines of Th√ºringerwald, living among a very amiable and childlike population. The German' dont[don't] understand their deeds after all. Prussen do the iron crest of this huge and soft German body; but the body is so soft indeed, that one should think, there were no bones in it.If the language did not impact my fancy and I should have a great deal to tell you. Let these lines shortly tell you, that you have been remembered in the metropole of German geniuses, and send some lines to the old Ils with infomaation[information] of your state of health.Hoping the best I am your Danish friendRudolf SchmidtRud. SchmidtJuly 17, 1785[1875]Ans. July 31. Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 17 July 1875"
