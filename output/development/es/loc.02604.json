    "text": "BelmontMassAug '85My Dear Friend: You are very kind to remember Kennedy—yryour son by adoption & affinity—Nothing in the world makes me prouder than to merit in only a slight degree yryour esteem. My indebtedness to you—estimating values by all that makes life high & noble—is simply boundless. Your confidential item abtabout royalties also makes me glad & wrings my heart at the same time. I cannot but think that the publisher has at least been negligent of yryour interests. Walt will you let me pay you now $5. on that $13 I owe? The $13. is a pure business debt. $5000. represents my soul indebtedness to Walt Whitman, who is the only god I at present worship apart from the Universe as a whole I can sympathize as to copyrights; I have not rec'dreceived a cent yet for my railroad book—a year's sales—not having sold much over a 1000 copies. I have passed civil service examinations (State, & U S.) & have a good prospect of soon getting position in the Custom House. May the gods be propitious! I saw \"The Voice of the Rain\" quoted in newspapers here. I hear that it is considered by many one of the most exquisite things you have done. Popular & sweet & plain it is. Compare Tennyson's latest grind with it for an idea of sophistication vs grand simplicity. Editor Baxter of Outing tells me that you think of visiting Boston soon, my most noble poet, & I implore thee (as Whittier wdwould say) to come & see me for a week & drink in our sublime prospect & be soothed by our matchless rural quiet (flowers, birds, & trees). I see by the Critic, with some consternation, that the members of the esoteric Whitman Comradeship in London are making up a good-will offering to send to Walt W. Let 'em do it Walt. But I shdshould suggest that the old way of yrsyours be hinted to 'em i.e. to let yryour books go over there. Let 'em send their tribute if it will please them, but let them take a cargo of books from McKay in return. That is the way to do the square thing. Here is a poet whose books are the delight of the finest minds in the world. He has earned & deserves a far greater competence than such an elegant peculator as Longfellow. Let us all then, exert our energy in the attempt to spread a knowledge of yryour \"new gladness & roughness\" wider & wider. That is the business-like & right way. You are defrauded of the wage of yryour life-labor otherwise. Damn it, what a mistaken blind, good bonhomme monster the people are! very affecttlyaffectionately yrsyoursW. S. Kennedy I shall be grieved to the heart if you dont come out & see me, if you shdshould come to Boston. This is yryour home, & I am your lover & friend remember now! William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, August 1885"
