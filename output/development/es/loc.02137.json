    "text": "Dear friend:I sent my article on you to Walsh some weeks ago—have not heard from him but assume he will use it soon. I will write him again if I do not hear this week. I thought it but fair that he should print an authentic report he has printed so many that were not true.I am very busy lecturing and writing now. I want to get out a volume of stories this fall—stories illustrative of the west and of social injustice. I am now bargaining with Roberts bros. thereto.—I am also writing dramas—my fourth and last is praised highly by practical managers and by literary critics. I shall try to bring that out next spring—I send you my photo—it may be of interest to you—I had just been lecturing upon your prose and the book in my hand is \"Specimen Days.\"With deepest wishes for your good health.Hamlin Garland. Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, [? June 1889]"
