    "text": "328 Mickle streetCamden New Jersey U S AmericaAug: 8 '85Dear friendYour third letter ab't the Tennyson visit arrived today—& has already been re-read with eager interest—as was the Toynbee Hall one also. I now anticipate the one ab't your meeting Mrs. Gilchrist.—Thanks, dear girl, for the past & thanks for those to come—Since you left we've had over three weeks of extremely hot weather—it affected me badly, caused some fits, unconsciousness, falling &c—I can't go out, which is quite a cross—but no doubt in due time things will return to their usual routine. I am sitting here down stairs by the window in the little front room, writing this—Mrs. Davis has just brought me a beautiful perfect middling sized sun flower—it looks like a curious golden face turning toward me from its jar on the window sill—Fine day this for the Grant funeral show in New York which is going on as I write—O I nearly forgot to mention the cyclone & destruction, brief but terrible, of last Monday—they did not touch these premises—but came very near. Well, Mary, dear girl, I am making out a stupid letter—but I was determined to write something—Affectionate remembrances to Alys, the Father and Mother, Logan, and to Mr C— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Mary Whitall Smith, 8 August 1885"
