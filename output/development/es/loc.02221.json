    "text": "Staten Island\"Kaywood\"Nov. 20th, 1880Dear Mr. Whitman,We were so delighted at receiving your books—& from you. We have always intended owning them & were only waiting to return to our little house in town. As we have now a volume belonging to Mr. Burroughs—Your poems have a great hold on us—& grow more & more to us in value.In London last winter we saw the Gilchrists several times & of course talked of you. Mrs. Gilchrist spoke most enthusiastically & affectionately of you & Mme. Modjeska who was acting there wanted us to remind you of her having had the pleasure of meeting you—She is making a great success.We read some of your poems to a group of people—artists etc., in London who were all intensely interested & impressed—One, Alfred Hunt, the landscape painter, was much moved over some of the descriptions of nature. The mocking birdmockingbird & the pine trees especially. Richard talked about you with William M. Rossetti, your good friend, & others who all were anxious to hear of you. Richard is very desirous to know whether you got some of your poems, done into Provençal, by W.C. Bonaparte Wyse. Would you write a line of acknowledgement to the latter, to be forwarded through Richard. Mr. Wyse would value it very greatly.Mr. Burroughs & Richard were camping out in September & there was a great deal of talk of W.W. under the pines beside the little Ulster Co. lake—I know you love children and I wish I could show you my little boy, of whom I am very proud.In February we will be again in our house & hope to see you there once more.With renewed thanks I am dear Mr Whitman one of your sincerest admirersHelena de Kay GilderWe are both most obliged to you & I endorse the foregoing.R.W.G.from Mr & Mrs Gilder New York (Gilder you know is a sort of chief literary man now in Scribner's)see notes Aug 9 1888 also 10th Aug. Helena de Kay Gilder to Walt Whitman, 20 November 1880"
