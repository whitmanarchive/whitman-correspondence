    "text": "14 Milborne Grove,Brompton, London,May 9, 1868.My dear Walt,I regret to say I was unable to do anything with the proof of Personalism. I tried several magazines, but they were already made up for their May numbers. It is the habit of literary folk to leave London during Easter, and in order that they might do so this year the editors had their magazines for May fixed early in April. But in any case I could hardly hope to get an article in here unless I had it three months beforehandâ€”for it takes so much time to get it from one editor to another before it gets to the man who wants it. I shall be very glad to serve you always, and regret that I have failed in this case.The Reviews have not got hold of you fairly yet; but the good discussion will surely come.A member of Parliament who once read some quote passage from Leaves of Grass is now reading Rosetti's volume with great interest and fast changing his opinion.But in the last mentioned matters I hope to write you more at length hereafter.Cordially your friend,M. D. Conway. Moncure D. Conway to Walt Whitman, 9 May 1868"
