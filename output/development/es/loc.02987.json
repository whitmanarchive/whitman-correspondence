    "text": "1015 O St. N.W.Washington dc April 27. 1890. Dear Walt, Thank you for all papers &c. that you have so kindly sent, & especially for the \"Poet-Lore\" with article about William, & the Transcript of the 19. with notice of your Lincoln Memorial evening. It is good, & I am thankful that you could go & and do it. Most noble & fitting; & I wish I could have been there. As for me, dear Walt, I feel as if I had been more or less under a cloud, the cloud that comes of having to give too much thought & care to this world's affairs,— the tow to provide for the food, shelter & raiment of the body. My friends have been trying to get me a place in the Census Bureau, but as yet without success. I felt that I must hold on to this little home till I could see my way somewhat, & I think I have done well in so doing. I hope to be able to have a home still, & a plan is now under consideration by which I hope to have a home with a friend. If it matures I will let you know. Soon it will be a year since William passed on! The 9th of May, so soon here now, & what a long year it has been to me; & yet in another way it seems but yesterday that I watched his last hours.— I am very sorry to learn that you have been down with the \"grip,\" which we have had here. You told me that you have, or can get all Magazines & papers. Have you seen the \"New England Magazine\" for March 1890. It has a story \"A Strange Dinner Party\"— by my niece, Grace Ellery Channing. If you get it, & read it, & don't care to keep it, I shall be glad of it. She is writing quite a good deal, but says that since her uncle William O'Connor died, she feels that her \"literary conscience is gone.\" She also has published in the \"Overland Monthly\" but I never see[saw] that. I will send you a little poem of hers, & will like you to return it, as I have no other of hers. It was in \"Kate Field's Washington\" of Feb. 12 1890. How I wish I could run over & see you! When \"my ship comes in,\" I will. Will it come in, in this life? I must not forget to tell you that our old lady friend, Mrs. Johnson died last Wednesday, at the age of 95 years & 4 months! Of old age—the doctor said she had no disease. I send you, dear Walt a paper that that I promised, with notice of William's funeral. Send a postal card to let me know get them, please. I am alone still, but am to have two young girls with me for six weeks, to board until their schools done. One reason why I have so desired to hold on to a home, is that in the pecuniary distress of the Channings if they have to give up their beautiful home in Cal. I may have a refuge for them here, & so perhaps return in small measure their many benefits to us in the time of dear Jeannie's sickness, & again when William went out there. But, dear Walt, I try to keep up a good heart, & not doubt or dispond. God bless you! with all the old love— Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 27 April 1890"
