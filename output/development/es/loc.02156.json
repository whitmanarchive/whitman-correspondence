O'Connor Life Saving ServiceWashington DC A young lady special friend of mine Mary Whitall Smith is coming to London, (with her parents) & I want her to come & see you—I think of her as thoroughly American—(of Quaker stock) with the best English qualities added (If you or Herb send to Dr B and the others mention it in letter or card to me) Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 10 June 1885"
