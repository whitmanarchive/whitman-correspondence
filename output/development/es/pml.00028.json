    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. April 7, 1869. Dear Abby,Here I am in the same office, at the same desk, writing to you again—though the interval I know has been too long—but I will try not to let so long a time elapse in future. There is not much difference with me, in any respect—I have been, & am quite well, considering—though I have had trouble from a cold during the winter & spring—My situation in the office continues the same—The new Attorney General, Mr. Hoar, treats me very kindly—He is from Concord, Mass. & is personally intimate with Emerson. Washington has been swarming with office-seekers—about half of whom have left—thousands in disgust—it is quite a curiosity to see them around the Departments, in the hotels, and at the White House & Capitol—The O'Connors are well as usual—William is still in the Treasury DeptDepartment—I spent last Sunday evening with them, at their house—I am still boarding at the same place—I expect to bring out the final edition of my book the ensuing summer—stereotyped—(positively last appearance for the season &c) as the play bills say—Abby, I have been waiting till I felt in the mood to write a long, good [inter]esting letter to you [all?]—but it's no use waiting—so I write this. Don't be mad at me because I have been so negligent—You all have my love & \"best respects\" to boot—how I should like just to come in & spend the afternoon & evening with you—& Helen & Emily—& then have a good bouncing argument with Mr. Arnold, about finances, patriotism, &c &c—What do you think of Grant—his doings—especially some of his diplomatic appointments—Washburn, for instance? Good bye, dear friends—Love to you all. Walt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 7 April 1869"
