    "text": "St. Louis,Feb 7th 1873My dear MotherI wrote you a few days ago apprising you as to Mattie's health  I do not see that there is any change since then—if any she is somewhat easier—that is these terrible fits of coughing and choking do not come so often—yet when they do come I hardly expect her to come out of themThe weather has been exceedingly pleasant here for four or five days now and I have had Mattie out in the buggy for about an hour each day—this seems to do her more good than anything elseTo-day, if I can arrange it I intend to take her to a photograph gallery to have another picture takenShe speaks often and much about you—and wants to see you very, very much—I suppose you would hardly dare undertake the journey—and it would be impossible for me to leave her to come for you—of course I would arrange all the money matters if you could come—I suppose you know how the coming would be—you would take a \"section\" in one of the through sleeping cars—you would be abtabout 40 hours on the car—this car would bring you to East St. Louis—where I would meet you—here we would take a carriage that would take you to the house—Of course I can understand that you may not feel able for the journey—but I feel positive that if you once did get here you would feel better than you do—I will write you as soon as I can again  Love to George and Loo and Eddy—I hope you are feeling pretty well dear Motheraffectionately Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 7 February 1873"
