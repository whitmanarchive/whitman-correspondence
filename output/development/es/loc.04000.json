    "text": "328 Mickle streetCamdenEvn'g Nov. 18 '84My dear friendsYour kind letter (Eva's) came this afternoon & it gave me real comfort both to hear from you & have such loving remembrance & friendly invitation—Harry, dear boy, I hardly think I shall be able to come down & be with you this Thanksgiving—but I will come one of these times—Since I have got into this shanty, although I go out every day, I don't go any distance—havn't been away this past summer, only one short trip to Cape May—My lameness increases on me—it probably won't be long before I shall be unable to get around at all——General health otherwise about the same as usual—Eva, my dear friend it would be a true comfort for me if it was so I could come in every few days, and you and Harry and I could be together—I am sure it would be good for me——Nothing very new in my affairs—not much sale for my books at present, or for the last fifteen months—Harry your Mother call'd here last Monday, but I was not in, was over to Germantown—I was sorry to be away—I am writing this up in my room—am alone most of the time—write a little most every day—sell a piece once in a while—Maintain good spirits and a first-rate appetite—My dear friends, indeed I appreciate your loving wishes & feelings, & send you mine the same, for both of you—Walt WhitmanEva would you like to have me send you some papers now & then? Write me whenever you can. Harry I am sorry about the neck—I think it will get right & heal in time Walt Whitman to Harry and Eva Stafford, 18 November 1884"
