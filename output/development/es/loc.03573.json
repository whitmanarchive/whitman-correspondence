    "text": "August 4thFairview.DelganyCo. WicklowIreland.My Dear Walt. Its a long time now since I've written to you, & I owe you thanks for the many papers, &c. you have sent me, containing verse & other matter connected with you. I asked you the last time I wrote to let me have one small poem which I felt especially stirred by, in your own handwriting. I don't think I've heard from you since then. Will you remember this now, if it doesn't trouble you too much? I don't possess a single line of your verse in your own handwriting, & I should think it a very precious possession. The poem I meant is that on the Arctic snowbird. I send you herewith a magazine of which I have been made Editor. The article signed 'H. Rowlandson' is mine. It (i.e. the Review) emanates from Trinity College Dublin and aims at introducing Nationalist thought among the upper classes in Ireland. We have to go forward very cautiously in this enterprise, political questions here are so fiercely debated, & at present we can only reconcile the landed interest & conservative element by opening our columns to both sides alike. To get Nationalists admitted at all to an audience in Trinity College is a great step. We publish an article by Michael Davitt in September. I have been getting acquainted with him and other prominent members of the National party here since I came back. The best man I have met in Ireland is John O'Leary, formerly editor of the 'Irish People', imprisoned in 1865 for Fenianism. He has been living in Paris ever since; let out after 5 years on condition of remaining abroad till his sentence (20 years) was out. This expired in Jan/1885 & he is to the fore again now. A grand looking old man—long white beard, aquiline features, keen eyes—spare, sinewy frame, full of restrained passion and energy. What about Dr Knortz? I have heard nothing from him at all about that translation of the L. of G. which he should have had revised & ready long ago. I think of writing to him about it. I fully expected it would have appeared before May. We have gone into a house of our own now, at least one we have rented for several years, & we are pretty well fixtures now. All of us well—especially my two little boys, who enjoy the country life very much. We have a good garden & a little land which I work myself. On the whole, like this sort of life very much. We are about ¾ of an hour by train from Dublin, so have easy access to libraries, fr. there. I hope you are well & hearty. I am sorry to hear the sale of the L. of G. has not been so good lately. Wish we had fairly opened it in Germany. Will you send a line to Knortz? I was to give him 20 dollars for the work—am only waiting to hear that it is complete to send it, but don't like sending till I know that he is going in for the thing, as I havn't yet even heard that he had begun it. Cover of our Review in old Celtic design. Yours alwaysT. W. Rolleston. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 4 August [1885]"
