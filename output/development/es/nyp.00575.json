    "text": "328 Mickle Street—Camden New JerseyU S AmericaFeb. 2 '87Dear friendYours rec'd & welcomed, as always—I send Vol. of \"Specimen Days and Collect,\" with emendations—My notion would be for you to print a Vol. including all to page 200, and call it \"Specimen Days in America—By Walt Whitman\" for title page, & then another Vol. of the matter from page 203 to 338 (including \"My Book & I\" which I send) & call it \"Democratic Vistas and other papers\" by Walt Whitman for title page—making two books—But I leave the thing, (after having expressed my suggestion, & sent you the copy) in your & the publisher's hands, with full authority from me to do what the exigencies require, & what you think best—should I feel like writing a few lines for Preface, I will send you within ten days—but if not, not—It is not certain—If you don't get such lines from me go on without them when you are ready—Should you wish the print facing page 222 I can get it for you, printed here in Philadelphia by the 100 or 1000—(I think it is ab't 3cts a piece, but am not certain)—or I will send you the photo & you can have one made there, if you prefer to have your own as you may—Write me often as you can—I am tied up in my corner by paralysis, & welcome friends' letters—bad cold raw weather—my bird is singing furiously—I am ab't as usual—Walt WhitmanI have put a couple of photos in the book, at page 122—one is for you—the other I think you can transfer & make for yourself a good plate for picture for the book—I like it better to go in the vol. of the book off against the scene in the text described (as at p. 122)—tell the pub. when he sends me my 10 guineas to send (if convenient) in P.O. order, (or orders) to me at 328 Mickle st. Camden New Jersey—Write soon, & specifically, & copiously—I will send you the lith. portraits you request—If you want another copy of \"Spe. Days,\" to make proper printer's copy, get one of Wilson's Glasgow Ed'n—it is correct—mind my emendations—Go & see B F C Costelloe, 40 Grosvenor Road, the embankment, & ask to be introduced to his wife, Mrs. C. She is an American, & my best friend— Walt Whitman to Ernest Rhys, 2 February 1887"
