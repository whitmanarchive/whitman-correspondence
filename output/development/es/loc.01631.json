    "text": "431 Stevens st. Camden, N. Jersey,May 1–2 p.m.1874Dear Pete,I have been out halting around for a walk, as it is quite pleasant today—But I believe I have overdone the matter, as I have a pretty bad feeling the last hour or two both in the head & left side,—& as I sit here writing,—So your limited express seems to be a real success—if it keeps up as well as it has begun I have no doubt it will increase, & be patronised, & become a permanent institution—(I had got the idea, somehow, at first, that the same crew went through from Wash.Washington to New York, & so was some in hopes of seeing you in Philadelphia)—No change in my condition or prospects—the young man, Walter Godey, still works as my substitute in the Solicitor's office—I havn'thaven't had any word from Eldridge in two months, nor from Mrs. O'Connor in some time—(have you been up there?) Do you see Hinton or Tasistro?—My sister has just called me to my dinner—so I will close for this time. Your oldWalt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 1 May [1874]"
