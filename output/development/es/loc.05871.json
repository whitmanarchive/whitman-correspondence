We hold you in affectionate remembrance as we pass over the waters to England where once we hoped to have had your company. We beg that you will send us from time to time as you feel able accounts of your health and of all that nearly concerns you concerns us also who love you.Our passage across the whole way has been nearly as smooth as a duck pond, and my health has been very much benefitted by it.I bear your messages of love and remembrance to your many friends in London, who without my privileges of personal fellowship with you, honour and love you. I hope that the knowledge of this may often cheer and console you in hours of pain and weariness. Alys, my faithful secretary, joins me in the expression of the hearty affection with which I am alwaysYour loving friendR. Pearsall Smithper Alys Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 2 July 1888"
