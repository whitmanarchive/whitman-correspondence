    "text": "Washington,July 10 1863. Dear mother,I suppose you rec'd a letter from me last Wednesday as I sent you one Tuesday, (7th)—dear mother, I was glad enough to hear from George, by that letter from Snyder's Bluffs, June 28th—I had felt a little fear on acc't of some of those storming parties Grant sent against Vicksburgh the middle of June & up to the 20th—but this letter dispels all anxiety—I have written to George many times, but it seems he has not got them—Mother, I shall write immediately to him again—I think he will get the letter I sent last Sunday, as I directed it to Vicksburgh—I told him all the news from home. Mother, I shall write to Han & inclose George's letter—I am real glad to hear from Mat & the little one, all so favorable—We are having pleasant weather here still—I go to Campbell Hospital this afternoon—I still keep going, mother—the wounded are doing rather badly I am sorry to say, there are frequent deaths. The weather, I suppose, which has been peculiarly bad for wounds, so wet & warm, (though not disagreeable outdoors)—Mother, you must write as often as you can, & Jeff too—you must not get worried about the ups & downs of the war—I don't know any course but to resign onesself[oneself] to events—if one can only bring one's mind to it—Good bye once more for the present, dearest mother, Mat & the dear little ones.WaltMother, do you ever hear from Mary— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 10 July 1863"
