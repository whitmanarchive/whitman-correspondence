Still keep well for me & jolly—am all tann'dtanned & sunburnt—Eat my rations every time—I was up yesterday to Camden to get my mail—& found the book—read it all over with appreciative & I think critical eyes—my impression of liking it, as a curiously homogeneous work—(just enough radiations to make it piquant)—& in connection liking the name &c—all deepened & clinched. I especially much like—& more like—the chapter about me. There has certainly been nothing yet said that so makes the points—(& eloquently makes them—) I most want brought out & put on record—Are you coming to the Gilchrists? & when?WW Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 17 May [1877]"
