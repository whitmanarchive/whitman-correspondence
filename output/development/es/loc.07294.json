    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,9 April 1889Weather here perfect, we shall have I guess a very early spring. Road drying up and getting quite good after the last snow which is all gone except patches in the shady places. Your welcome card of 7th to hand this morning, also (from you) a copy of \"Journalist\" cont.g J.R. Meader's very excellent article (though a little narrow) on \"N.B.\" and L. of G. generally. By same mail came the April \"Scottish Art Review\" with Carpenter's piece on \"N.B.\" somewhat mechanical but good sentences here & there in it. All well here. All quiet. Nothing yet from Wm Gurd. Pardee is better again and I am glad to hear that O.C. is also. Love to you alwaysYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 April 1889"
