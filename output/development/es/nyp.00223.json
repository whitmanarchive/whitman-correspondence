    "text": "New York,July 30, 1865.Dear Sir,Looking over a file of papers in the reading room I saw a paragraph about your dismissal from the Interior Department, and as I once read your book, I am moved to express my feelings in the matter. The act strikes me as pretty mean but quite of a piece with Harlan's character. As I see you are in the Atty Gen'l's office I will call on you when I come to W. in a few days and tell you in confidence a little transaction I once had with Harlan, long time ago, which will show you what kind of chap he is. I read your book when it first came out and though I must admit a good deal of it was blind to me, I saw considerable which struck me as first class, though I don't pretend to much judgment in such matters. Anyhow I didn't see anything worse in what Harlan makes so much of than what is in old Bill Shakespeare and the Bible, and dashed in pretty thick too. Some folks are more squeamish than me, though.—Perhaps you might like to hear something Mr. Lincoln once said of you, which you probably never heard of. It wasn't much to say, but the way he said it struck me a good deal. It was in the winter time, I think in '64 I went up to the White House with a friend of mine, an M. C., who had some business with the President. He had gone out, so we didn't stop, but coming down stairs, quite near the door we met the President coming in and we stept back into the East Room and stood near the front windows, where my friends had a confab with him. It didn't last more than three or four minutes, but there was something about a letter which my friend had handed the President, and Mr Lincoln had read it and was holding it in his hand like one thinking it over, and looking out of the window when you went by, quite slow, with your hands in the breastpockets of your overcoat and a sizeable felt hat on your head pretty well up, just as I have often seen you on Broadway. Mr. Lincoln asked who you were, or something like that. I spoke up and said, mentioning your name and that you had written \"Leaves of Grass,\" etc. Mr. Lincoln didn't say anything but took a good long look till you were quite gone by. Then he says—(I cant give you his way of saying it, but it was quite emphatic, and odd), \"Well,\" he says, \"he looks like a man.\" He said it pretty loud but in a sort of absent way and with the emphasis on the words I have underscored. He didn't say any more but began to talk again about the letter and in a minute or so, we went off. Seeing your name just now in the paper put me in mind of it it and I thought it was an item you might like to know. It was the only time I spoke to Mr. Lincoln though I saw him often.I expect to be in Washington on my way down South in a few days and will take the freedom of giving you a call. Please don't mention my name in connection with what I write about Harlan. I'll explain why when I see you and you will see the reason for not spreading it round.With respect, &c., truly yours,A. Van Rensallaer. A. Van Rensellaer to Walt Whitman, 30 July 1865"
