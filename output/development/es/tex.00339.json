    "text": "Tuesday afternoon, 2 o'clockDearest mother,I am writing this over at the office—I have made a sort of commencement of my work to-daytoday—I have rec'dreceived this note (enclosed) from Lillie Townsend—Mother, I believe I will write them a few lines, soon—(What is Aunt Sally's name—is it Sarah Pintard)—when you next write tell me—I am feeling quite well—(only easily put out with my head)—I have been in the office nearly three hours to-day, & have got along comfortable—I can only move slowly yet—cannot walk any—at least any distance—Wednesday, April 2.Mother, I am over at the office—feel rather slim to-day—but the weather is so pleasant, I shall feel better I think—Your letter has just come, & I am glad as always to hear from you all—you say George's house is commenced, the cellar begun—I like to hear all about its progress—I see in the papers this morning an awful shipwreck yesterday night—seems to me the worst ever happened, a first-class, big steamship from England, went down almost instantly, 700 people lost, largely women & children, just as they got here, (towards Halifax)—what misery, to many thousand relatives & friends—Mother, I send you the Graphic—the pictures are amusing—(I thought I would write a line to the Townsends, mostly on Aunt Sally's account, as it may humour her)—Well, mother, I believe that is all to-daytoday—I hope this will find you feeling well & in good heart, dearest mother—Love to Brother George & Sister Lou—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [1]–2 [April 1873]"
