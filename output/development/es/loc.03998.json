    "text": "CamdenJan: 30 '83 Evening—Dear friendYour letter came & I ought to have written to you before, but one thing & another prevented. I was up to Germantown, to a friend's, where I have been a good deal lately,—Spent the Christmas & New Year holidays there—they came for me, so I went & was glad—a big house full of people, old & young folks, & plenty of fun & every thing good—lots of oysters—& cook'dcooked so nice—I never knew how much there is in the cooking—Otherways I have been here in C.Camden all the time, have done a little work writing, but nothing much,—My brother from St Louis has been on here with us for a while—& I have callers & visitors quite often—Ruth I got your letter—it was very acceptable—I will answer it before longHow are you all? I hope this will find you all well—little George is all right again I trust by this time—I met two jolly & good-looking Jersey boys this afternoon over in Market Street, Phila.Philadelphia—it was Elmer and Ed Stafford—we had a little talk—did me good to meet them—I dont[don't] think Jersey has two nicer looking boys—I was on my way to West Philadelphia to see about a Mr Anders, an elderly man sick with consumption. Young Mr Anders and I had got acquainted in Canada two years ago, & quite attached to each other—he was a soldier there—I got a letter from him from Montreal day before yesterday, asking me to go to a certain number in West Phila:Philadelphia & see his father, who had come on here some time ago quite sick—Young A. wanted me to see & write to him how the father was particular—So I went up to-day—when I got there I found the elder A. was dead & buried—so I have just had to write the sad intelligence to my Canada friend—love to you & allW WI have written a few lines to HarryI want to come down soon—Is the coast clear? Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 30 January 1883"
