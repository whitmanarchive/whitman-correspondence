    "text": "431 Stevens street Camden New Jersey SeptSeptember 24D Y KilgoreDear SirSend me word immediately when (day & hour) & where the Paine bust affair is to come off. I see an announcement in the paper that I am to read a poem on the occasion. I do not propose to read a poem—but I will promise to be there, & speak just a little (say 10 minutes)—if I can be put on the early part of the program (as waiting fags me out entirely)—& perhaps it would be necessary that I should be sent for in a carriage. I would advise that you have some good music, & no long-winded address at all. (Couldn't you get some good baritone singer to sing Paine's fine lively old song of \"the Liberty Tree\"?) Walt Whitmanbest respects to Mrs Kilgore—love to Charley— Walt Whitman to Damon Y. Kilgore, 24 September [1876]"
