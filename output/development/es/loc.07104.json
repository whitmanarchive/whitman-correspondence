    "text": "Ledgewood Terrace,Murray Street, Malden.Dec. 25, 1888.My dear Friend: I received your beautiful gift yesterday afternoon just in time for Xmas, and I cannot express how much it pleases me. Kennedy brought it in to the Herald office for me and I was very sorry to be out at the time, for I have not seen him for some months, having been in Europe most of the Autumn. The book is a noble one—a form worthy of its contents, and to me, as to many, it will be an inestimable treasure. I think the friendly touches your hands have given it bestow an influence, real though impalpable, which may make itself felt more strongly than might be imagined by most men.It is interesting and instructive to me to watch the development of our dear country on the prophetic lines that your \"Democratic Vistas\" indicate. Evolutionary processes are rapid at certain stages, and bit by bit one may detect, if his eyes be clear, the realization and the budding promises of realization—and in this sense even the black clouds are welcome for the sake of the clearer skies that follow.If you do any reading now a days you will find Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\" a noble work, and delightful as well. It has made a profound impression and will do much towards realizing a grander future for our land.I enclose a photograph of myself with wishes that the New Year may be kind to you.Faithfully yoursSylvester Baxter Sylvester Baxter to Walt Whitman, 25 December 1888"
