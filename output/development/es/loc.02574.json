    "text": "New York,Sept 22 1890Dear Walt:It is very nice to know that you are well enough to write two such nice letters.It is wonderful—the rallying power that dame Nature gives us.I am glad you are pleased with my idea of Ingersoll lecturing.It will be a great event. One that us Whitmanites will rejoice over as long as we live.I got Ingersoll interested two years ago in Saratoga.Since then he has dipped into L. of G. very often, (I can tell) and now—what do you think!! The otherday he said to me \"Johnston do you know that I think there is nothing greater in Poetry in our language than Walt's tribute to Lincoln\"Ingersoll has a great soul, and it did me good to hear him say it. And it was then I suggested the lecture, I want an address by him in permanent shape, that dinner speech ought to have been saved for posterity—Now we will perhaps have something as great or greater.—Excuse great haste. Regards to Mrs Davis.Yrs sincerelyJH Johnston John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 22 September 1890"
