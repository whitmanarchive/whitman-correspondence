    "text": "Washington, U. S. America.September 15, 1872. My dear Rudolf Schmidt,Your letter of 17th August has just reached me—also the Dagbladet, (four no'snumbers.) The feuilleton about me I have just had read in English by a Dane, Mr. Bendz. I am deeply touched at being more and more brought right among warm human hearts in Denmark, Norway, &c—& so friendly entertained there. It comforts & nourishes me more than you know. The former letters, & the papers you have sent, have all come safely to hand—& I thank you. I have just returned from a visit of some days to Philadelphia. It is a great materialistic city full of the middling classes, (mechanics, laborers, operatives in factories (both sexes), traders, &c)—in extraordinary physical comfort—700,000 people, & five–sixths of them well–off, in plenty of the best food & clothing, & ample & respectable houses—there are almost no very miserable & vagabond classes or quarters in the city, vast & teeming as it is. I am now back here at work for the fall & winter—My address is permanently here—I get all your letters & papers safely. Clausen has not yet arrived. I have lately rec'dreceived a paper from Pesth, Hungary, with a feuilleton about my poems. Farewell, for this time.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 15 September 1872"
