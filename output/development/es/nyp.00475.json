    "text": "Camdennoon Feb. 19 '83Dear friendYou will get a copious shower (Dr B[ucke] and me together) of these pestering messages. I have been looking through the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] as Dr B sent it in his copy, & it comes to my soul over the dozen years more eloquent & beautiful than ever—seems to me, (as a passionate shooting shaft launched into those times, & indeed fitting to the whole situation then & since)—it deserves to stand just as it is—two passages in the last page only might be left out, & I should so suggest. Seems to me all that is wanted is a brief preparatory ¶ dated present time, distinctly confirming your faith &c. that it is without diminution (it couldn't have \"increase\")—Tomorrow & next day the printers will be waiting for the copy. It is intended to put the copy, whole book, in hand in force, & have it out soon—Send to me here—I am pretty well this ending winter. Yes I rec'd the big Powell Ethnology & have made more than one courageous attack on it (thought I acknowledged it)—The air here (human & other) all nervous from the pouring crowds of big disasters, floods, mine cavings, deaths, wrecks, big casualties from every quarter—W. W. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 19 February 1883"
