I attended the Review the other day on purpos[purpose] to see you, but I failed and I now fear you are not in Washington or I think I would have seen you. I wish you would come and see me if you can, I expect to go home soon. I think our Regiment will be in Washington the later part of this week or the first of next week and then I shall try to see you. If you see Miss H[oward] please tell her I am sorry she did not call at my company the evening she was at the Regt. I heard from her in a short time after she had gone, but then it was to late.I am sorry that I did not see her and I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you before I leave Washington. Hoping to hear from you soon I will close for to day, Yours Truly, Jesse Mullery to Walt Whitman, 11 June 1865"
