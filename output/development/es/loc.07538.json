B in McKay's style of binding—McK has been (is) off N Y & Boston ward \"drumming\"—is expected to come back to-day or to-morrow—Sorry indeed to hear such bad prospects of Pardee—I recd a few lines dated Oct 27 from O'C[onnor], also a postal from Mrs. O'C—the eye trouble still continued—lively letter in ab't the same as usual—kind, affectionate, & sparkling. Horace comes unfailingly & is a main reliance—I feel half & half—pretty fair bowel movements—no Osler for ten days—bright & sunny to-day—Have been reading Matthew Arnold's \"Heine\"—also George Elliot on same—both good (but probably not exhaustive)—God bless you—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 31 October 1888"
