    "text": "Copenhagen18 April 1876Dear Walt Whitman.I have postponed to answer your letter of 27 January in the wanton hope to collect among your Danish friends an amount great enough to read you an order for a number of copies of your writings, that should be large sufficiently large to make impression on the newspapers in your own country.My hope has been frustrated; I am myself a very lonely man without great connections, especially in the last years. Therefore my dear friend I can only beg you accept my sincere sympathy with your unfortunate condition. I have myself my considerable lot of difficulties. In these days I have got a little harbour for my old father and now I am going to marry without fortune and closing all my expectations to the incertain[uncertain] fate of a book, which shall appear in the autumn. When this letter is in your hand, I most probably shall be a married man.I shall as every time be glad to hear from you.Rudolf SchmidtHave you not seen the name of Clemens Peter, seen newly in papers and periodicalsâ€”? Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 18 April 1876"
