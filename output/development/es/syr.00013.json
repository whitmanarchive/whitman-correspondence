    "text": "see notes June 24 1889from JB Marvin Feb '871121 I St.Washington D.C.Feb. 16th '87My Dear Walt.This morning I had occasion to call at the house of a Mr. William Brough, who lives in a costly residence on Farragut Square and is a very pleasant, educated manâ€”evidently of wealth. I saw there on the wall of his parlor a fine, large cut of yourself in a handsome frame. I found that he admired Drum-Taps very much. I mentioned the proposed pension for you, and he said that if you were in need of assistance he thought there would be no trouble in raising a purse and that he would be glad to take hold of the matter if it was thought advisable. If the pension is not authorized I will see him again about the subscription.Eldridge and O'Connor have gone to California to the place where Dr. Channing resides, and have arrived safely. I saw them off two weeks ago. O'Connor, I fear cannot hold out long, but his place is kept open for him here. His trouble is induration of the spinal marrow.I have been dropped out of the Govt. Service to make room for a Democrat and am looking about here for something to do. I am thinking of starting a Bureau of General Information. Literary, Scientific and Political, at the Capital of the Nation. The only question is whether I can subsist till the Bureau becomes a paying institution.I enclose a paragraph I cut out of the Richmond Va. Times. Let me hear from you. Wishing you health and happiness and long life I am,Yours sincerelyJos. B. Marvin Joseph B. Marvin to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1887"
