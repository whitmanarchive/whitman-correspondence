    "text": "see notes July 26 1888Ans. May 2dEsopus N.Y.,May 17. 74Dear Walt:I recd received a magazine (the Galaxy) from you yesterday, which I have been preparing in a little to day, but the day has been so beautiful & the charm of the open air so great that I could not long keep my eyes on the printed page. The season is at last fairly in for it, and the fruit trees are all getting in bloom. My bees are working like beavers & there is a stream of golden thighs pouring into the hive all the time. I can do almost anything with them & they wont sting me. Yesterday I turned a hive up & pruned it, that is cut out a lot of old dirty comb; the little fellows were badly frightened & came pouring out in great consternation, but did not offer to sting me. I am This page only —5— going to transfer a swarm in a day or two to a new style of hive. I spend all my time at work about the place & like it much. I run over to M. to look after bank matters for a day or two then back here. The house is being plastered & will be finished during the summer. The wrens & robins & phoebe birds have already taken possession of various nooks of it, & if they are allowed to go on with their building I must stop mine. During that snow storm the last of april the Hermit thrush took refuge in it. We are surrounded with birds here & they are a great comfort & delight to me.Your room is ready for you & your breakfast plate warmed. When will you come? I know the change would do you good & your presence would certainly do us good. We are counting on your coming & do not disappoint us. I will meet you in N.Y. if you will tell me when. Let us hear from you soon. Ursula sends love.As EverJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 17 May 1874"
