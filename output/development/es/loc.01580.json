    "text": "BrooklynJuly 28.Dear son,I shall return on Monday next, in the 12:30 train from Jersey city—(the train I usually come in)— Pete, I have rec'd your letter of 26th—Mother seems to-day full as well as usual—I continue all right— I have been on to New Haven, about 75 miles from here—a former friend of mine Charles Hine, a painter to whom Whitman wrote on May 9, 1868. On August 4, 1871, Mrs. Hine informed Walt Whitman of her husband's death: \"I think after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished\" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, ed., With Walt Whitman in Camden (1906–1964), 5 vols., III, 330). Mrs. Hine, who visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman Whitman on August 22, 1871, thought it \"strange\" that Walt Whitman did not write (Trent Collection, Duke University). According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of September 30, 1871, Mrs. Hine had received a \"donation\" from Walt Whitman (Trent Collection, Duke University). Whitman also wrote of Charles Hine's illness in his July 26, [1871], letter to William O'Connor. is in a dying condition there, from consumption, & expressed such a strong desire to see me, that I went on—I thought he would die while I was there— he was all wasted, to a skeleton, faculties good, but voice only a low whisper—I returned last night, after midnight— Well, bub, my time here is short—I have had a good quiet visit—the best in some respects yet— & I feel satisfied—My darling son, we will very soon be together again— Your loving comradeWalt. Letter from Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 28 July [1871]"
