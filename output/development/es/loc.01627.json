    "text": "1873431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N.J.12 M Friday Dec.December 19.Dear boy Pete,Well, I am sitting here in the parlor again writing my weekly letter—as I write, the rain is pouring & it is a thick & dark day enough—I am feeling pretty bad, but it seems to be mostly from a severe cold in the head—anyhow I am having one of my bad spells, of which I have gone through so many—had a bad night last night—but have eat my breakfast this morning, & have no doubt I shall feel better before many days. Pete, I rec'd your letter & the Herald last Monday all right. Did Mr & Mrs. Nash get the 3 Graphics I sent them?—I have been out most every day the past week, & been across the river to Philadelphia—it has been a very pleasant week, & I have enjoyed sailing across the Delaware, & the splendid sunsets most every evening—it is my greatest enjoyment——Pete, all you write about folks & things in Washington is interesting to me—it will be read, every thing you scratch down, as I sit here a great deal of the time, (& time is dull & lonesome, at the best)—My pieces I have written (I believe I mentioned about it,) have not yet appeared in the Magazine—but the money has been paid me for them, & they are in type, & I have read the proofs—I will either send them to you, when printed, or send you word, so you can get them yourself—Did I send you both my letters about the Capitol in the Graphic?—I believe I did, but if not I can yet—I send you to-day's Phil.Philadelphia Press—nothing special in it—Well, good bye for this time, dear loving boy, Walt.Pete, how about running on here to see me for a day or two?—Couldn't you come, convenient, say latter part of next week? If you can, I will fix the time— Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 19 December [1873]"
