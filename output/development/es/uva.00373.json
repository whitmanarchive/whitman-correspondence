Camden N Jersey May 7Editor Herald:Dear Sir:I merely write a line to call attention (lest it may be overslaughed in the rush of a great office) to the poem I sent you some days since, Song of the Exposition—(will make a column & a half close minion)—proposed to be printed, if at all, in the paper for May 10, if acceptable at the price named. I believe I mentioned in my note at the time that it had also been sent to the London Times and Chicago Tribune—& may, (or may not,) appear May 10, in them. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to the Editor, New York Herald, 7 May [1876]"
