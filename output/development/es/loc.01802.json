Why has not Spring come?I have waited for that, waiting a little also till I could get through some work which would have made me uncompanionable. Nowâ€”I go to New York on Saturday June 5 to the Century meeting and remain in NYNew York till Tuesday or Wednesday after. Can not you meet me, so as to return home with me? Apple blossoms surely will be out by then, and some summer warmth to enable you to enjoy your hammock (did I tell you? I have one?) on the piazza.I want you here and to set you to rights. Can you come then (not for a night or two but to stay indefinitely), or will you rather come later?Do which may best suit you, but come; and let me know as near as you can when I may look for you.Affectionately YoursWJWilliam J LintonI want a copy of your Mystic Trumpeter for England William J. Linton to Walt Whitman, 19 May 1875"
