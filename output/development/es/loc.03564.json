    "text": "Colon Isthmus of PanamaDecember 31, 1890To Walt WhitmanCamden, N.J.U.S.A.Dear Sir,I am the glad owner of a copy in two volumes—\"Leaves of Grass\" and \"Two Rivulets\"—of your works, Author's Centennial Edition, with photograph and Autograph. I am an old resident of this Isthmus, but, a New Yorker by birth and education, I am, I trust, a thorough American. These highly prized volumes of yours, and mine, became the latter by subscription, through my dear dead sister, (then Mrs Andrew Jackson Louis,) at the time of their publication. They have lain now a long time in New York until I sent for them and they came a month agoNot to weary you, I have now read over again Preface, Poems and Notes of \"Two Rivulets,\" and \"Democratic Vistas\" since the books came, and am impelled to say to you that I rejoice greatly that my country has given birth to one who has placed on record so grand a presentation of her case!Entering upon the New Year,let me then, my dear Walt Whitman, send you warm greeting from the Tropic world, and wish you all things good and happy! I too have ventured a little upon verse, (of which I will send you an unbound copy, having at present none other) and hope I am a \"live American\". The prose 4th of July address pray look at though you let the verses go by.Let me remain forever yoursTracy Robinson Tracy Robinson to Walt Whitman, December 31 1890"
