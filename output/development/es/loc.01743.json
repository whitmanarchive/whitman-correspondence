    "text": "Monday was 9th June in '73July9322 Stevens st. Camden, N.J.Monday June 7.1873Dear son,I am only able to write the same old story—since I last wrote, I have had some pretty bad spells—suffered at intervals all last week, & yesterday, with the strange & painful distress in the head, I have had so much of—But I feel better to-day—Every time I feel better, I find myself much encouraged—I still stick here, as I dontdon't dare to trust myself in a strange place, if I can help it. I rec'd your letter telling me you was too late to get any chance for the letter carrier's position—& about Mr. Noyes' friendliness—Are things just the same, as far as you and your crew, are concerned?—I think about you every night—I reproach myself, that I did not fly around when I was well, & in Washington, to find some better employment for you—now I am here, crippled, laid up for God knows how long, unable to help myself, or my dear boy—I do not miss any thing of Washington here, but your visits—if I could only have a daily visit here, such as I had there—I go out very little here—there is not much convenience here, for me to go out—one car line, passing about two squares off, consists of 4 cars, running semi-occasionally—and another line, about 3½ squares the other way, has I believe 6 or 7 cars—I get out & take a ride in them sometimes—my best jaunt is going in them to the ferry, & crossing on the boat to Philadelphia, to & fro, several times—But a great portion of the time I do not feel able to go out alone—fortunately I do not have any dizzy spells, nor any symptoms of them, so far,—so I am not worried about that, when I am out—As I write this, it is a very pleasant cool afternoon, & I am sitting here by the window in a big easy chairPete I hope this will find you feeling well, & in good spirits—Write me a good long letter, & tell me every thing—it will do you good——how does the new time go on the road, since Baltimore tunnel connection?—how about Washington—Tasistro—everybody?—get a good sheet of paper, & sit down in the park, with your lead pencil—I send you an envelope—also some one cent stamps——Love to you dear boy—Keep up a good heart—I do yet—though it is a long & hard pull sometimes with me lately. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 7 [July 1873]"
