    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,5 Sept 1889Your card of 2d came to hand last evening. That you are feeling even \"middling\" well and that you are in a condition to be \"sort of busy\" is good news. Putting Dick's account of you any[and] your own together I conclude that you are really wonderfull well \"considering.\" You must be quite a little better than you were this time last year and I do not now see why you should not still gain. Begins to look here as if something might be done very shortly in the way of getting the meter started. We are all well and there is no news since I wrote lastLove to youRM BuckeI do not understand why Horace's dinner book does not comeâ€”thought it was to be along in Aug.RMB Richard M. Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1889"
