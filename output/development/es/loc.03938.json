    "text": "Camden Tuesday morningMay 3 '87Dear friendI got home all right Sunday afternoon—had a nice enjoyable ride—enjoyed my visit anyhow—Yesterday I felt pretty dry, up in my room, & made a glass of drink, water, sugar & vinegar—from that bottle you gave me—such as I remember my dear mother making sixty years ago, for my father, of a hot day, when I was a little boy—& my drink went well too—Nothing new of any importance with me—Send you enclosed a letter just rec'd from Edward Carpenter—the dear good young man—I have just written him a few lines—told him ab't Harry—Warm & sunny to-day & I am sitting here with my window open—Mrs. D is off to Phil. & I shall be here alone all the forenoon. The bird is singing—the cars are puffing & rattling, & the children of the neighborhood are all outdoors playing—So I have music enough—Best love to you all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 3 May 1887"
