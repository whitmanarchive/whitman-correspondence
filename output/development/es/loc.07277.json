I shall be very anxious untill I hear further from you as to the result of the consultation. I understand of course about the enlargement of the prostate, that is a troublesome complaint but not a fatal matter, as for the \"diabetes\" I do not understand that—think that must be a mistake, I know there is some kidney trouble—some albuminuria—&c. however no doubt I shall soon be informed as to the whole matter and I trust you will write me yourself—I hope however that when I come East next month I shall find you something better than at present and that we shall be able to talk it all over. I am greatly pleased that you had a better night and trust that is the beginning of some better times for you.I hear nothing from Wm Gurd—they seem slow about the patents but I have no doubt we shall come out right side up eventually.We are all well hereI send you my loveR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 December 1888"
