Second (like a woman's postscript) have I told you at any time that I have been & am preparing a vol: of Ameri: poetry, up to your Centennial, for English publication? I would like, if I may, to use as fronticepiece your head, which will not hurt your fame on the other side; & 3000 miles off will not, I think, interfere with the appearance of the same head here with those new things which I want to see. May I use it? Say honestly yes or no, as you feel. I do not want to do what you might not like, whether in matter of interest or feeling. But I can have nothing I should like so well.I wish you were here now that the storms seem over. We have had such a spell of bad weather as I have never before been treated to by U.S.Yours alwaysWJWillian J. Linton the past three mos. thinks much of my head trouble is from the sun, I am almost always easier as day departs You are entirely welcome to use the eng: as you desire. I am about as usual—not any worse. Feel or fancy I feel relief already as summer wanes—one of my doctors William J. Linton to Walt Whitman, 21 August 1875"
