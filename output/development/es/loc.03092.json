    "text": "Nov 3 '90Dear W. W:How is this? I shd not have thought you cd have written so masterfully on so old a theme. You remind me of an incident: Dr Bucke + the attendant doctor I were making the rounds when we came to a fellow who was queried + searchingly examined by those wonderful eyes of the doctor's (Bucke's). \"Well,\" says, Doctor B. you are a prety sane man for a lunatic.\" So you seem to me a pretty live man for a dying (?) man! Not a living man could have written more rigorously than that (N-Am article).Yes. Wish we cd do honor to those glorious pumpkin pies. I like 'em hugely. I can see that that Ingersoll episode has brightened your spirits amazingly. May you live long, as Jefferson says in \"Rip.\" You perhaps saw my 1/3 col.column of Ingersoll's speech with remarks by me, in last Sat.'s Transcript (p. 2)â€”great \"'lection\" times here. Busy times for printers + editors.W. S. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 3 November 1890"
