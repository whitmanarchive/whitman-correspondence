What I want to know is whether, if I send a stenographer over to you, he could do your work, that is to say, could you dictate with perfect ease the article on Lincoln and such other articles as you may have intended for the North American Review, or any other of Mr. Rice's literary enterprises. I think I can manage to give you this help if you could utilize it. Very truly yours,Jas RedpathWalt Whitman, Esq.EsquireCamden, N. J. James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 23 October 1885"
