    "text": "CamdenP M April 18 '88Dear W. O'C.Your kind good copious letter came to-day & has been read & reread. Nothing new in the monotony of my life—I have rec'd a good plaster bust of Elias Hicks (size inclined to colossal) wh' I have put open in the corner of my room—& I think it does me good—perhaps needful almost to me—Elias at the latent base was sentimental-religious like an old Hebrew mystic—& though I may have some thing of that kind 'way in the rear it is pretty far in the rear & I guess I am mainly sensitive to the wonderfulness & perhaps spirituality of things in their physical & concrete expressions—& have celebrated all that——My writing for the Herald continues on—they have lately written to me to continue—they have paid me so far $165, wh' I call first rate—25 for the Whittier bit, also enclosed——The little slip enclosed, Lilt of Songs, I sent first (a week or ten days ago) to the Cosmopolitan NY—asking $12—it came back at once rejected—So I sent it to Herald—The Cosm. man stopt here last fall & urged me to send him something—but I think they now have new men—Yes I think Stedman inclined to be friendly & receptive—(L of G. though has to fight ag't a most infernal environment there in New York)Best love to you—Best love to Nelly—Walt Whitmanthe Herald April 18 (editorial page 5th col.) has some off hand remarks of mine on Matthew Arnold's death Walt Whitman to William Douglas O'Connor, 18 April 1888"
