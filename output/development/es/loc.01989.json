    "text": "SyracuseApril 7th/67Dear Friend & ComradeDear FriendI can not make any other excuse for my delay in answering your welcome letter of March 15th than negligence, for I have had time for it but I have kept putting it off from day to day because I have not had much news that I thought would interest you, and I do not know as it will now for I have not much to write of except my family affairs. My Wife started for New York City last friday night to be gone several weeks. she is to be with her Sister during her confinement, who is now having her fourth child and has not been married quite four years yet, she must be such a woman as you would sing a song toI spoke of going to South America but I have given that idea up for I do not believe a man can do as well any where else as he can in the United States the greatest country in the world, but I will tell you why I thought of going there. I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone but I had not ought to feel so.I would like very much to see you for I have so much to tell you and to talk about, but I fear I shall weary you with such a letter as this so I will close it with my Love to you.I don't know but I shall scold you if you delay answering this as long as you did my last for anything from you will interest me.Father sends good wishes to youB.H. Wilson.Benton H. WilsonApril 8â€”Answered April 13-67 Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 7 April 1867"
