I am still about the same as then—or, if any different, it is on the side of relief & improvement—I have the feeling to go out & try to get around—have better spirits than I could expect—but on trial, the least exertion confuses my head, & overcomes me. But I am sitting here at present in my room, comparatively comfortable—& feel every hope that I shall be able to give better account of myself next week. I am still clear of the pronounced bad spells of seven or eight days ago—a great gain & let-up. The weather here is fine. Walt WhitmanIsn't that Evangelical Alliance a pretty kettle of fish? I read the Tribune through every day. Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, [10 October 1873]"
