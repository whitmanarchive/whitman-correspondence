So you are going to Kansas, & it would seem you think of settling there—so it may be we shall not see each other—but I wish you to write to me, & let me know how it goes with you—& I hope, dear boy, you will continue to remember me with a love which time shall not fade out.My dear friends,N. M. and J. B. Pratt,I appreciate your kindness & your hospitable invitations, & I am sure it would be a good change & a comfort to me to come out & see you, & be with you a few days, surrounded with new scenery, & a farm life—it is what I should enjoy of all things—and I hope things may work so that I can come one of these days—if so, I will send you word, in advance—The picture of the dear daughter will be welcome—I should also like another of my dear loving boy Alfred, as soon as he gets any late ones, if he does so—So good bye & God bless you, my dear friends, & my love to all.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Alfred Pratt, N. M. Pratt, and John B. Pratt, 20 January 1870"
