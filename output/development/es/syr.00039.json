    "text": "[London, Ont.,]20 March [188]9Willy Gurd & I went to New York Monday evening [/] put up at Grand Union Hotel 42d Street [/] —I saw Johnston next day and lunched with him—they all asked most particularly after you. I saw J's new store (Union Square) he seems to be doing well but says he needs more capital than he has. We had a long conference with our New York lawyer and decided on a line or action in reference to the meter. We left N.Y. 6 o'clock last evening and after a very pleasant run of 17 3/4 hours arrived at London 11.45 today, 5 minutes (only) late. Find my folk all well and the asylum in good shape—a lot of work had accumulated which it will take a few days to wade through but that is nothing. As things look now I hope to be down your way again early in the summer, meanwhile you must keep me posted as to your health &c &c. [—] I find a book (sent for before I left home) [a]waiting me here—\"The Bacon-Shakspere question answered\" by C. Stopes. He /(rather she Charlotte Stopes[)] /believes S. wrote the plays—I expect to find the volume interesting and will send it to you if you would like to see it as soon as I gave run through it. [—] Willy Gurd & myself (though we should have been glad to found a company for the manufacture of the meter in Phila) are not the least discouraged by our failure. We believe more strongly than ever that the meter is immensely valuable and that we shall eventually carry our plans through—the only subject of regret on my own part / (except regret on Horaces account). /is that I shall not see you as much in the immediate future as I had hoped but I trust a few months will make this all right—all the folk here were greatly interested to hear from me all about you and they were much pleased that I could give so good an account of your health. (though certainly you might easily be better than you are).I will soon write againR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 March [188]9"
