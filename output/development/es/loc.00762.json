    "text": "Washington,Friday noon, February 6, 1863.Dearest mother,Jeff must have got a letter from me yesterday, containing George's last letter. The news of your sickness, and the strange silence of Han made me feel somewhat gloomy. I wrote to George yesterday, conveying the news—and to-day I have sent him another letter, with much more comfortable news, for I was so glad to hear from Han, (her letter, enclosed in Jeff's, received this morning) that I wrote him right away, and sent Han's letter. Mother, I am quite in hopes George will get a furlough—may-be my expectations are unfounded, but I almost count on it. I am so glad this morning to hear you are no worse, but changed for the better—and dear sister Mat too, and sissy, I am so glad to think they are recovering. Jeff's enclosure of $10 through Mr. Lane, from the young engineers, for the soldiers in hospitals, the most needy cases, came safe of course—I shall acknowledge it to Mr. Lane to-morrow. Mother, I have written so much about hospitals, that I will not write any in this letter.We have had bad weather enough here lately to most make up for the delightful weather we had for five weeks after I came from home.Mother, I do hope you will be careful, and not get any relapse—and hope you will go on improving. Do you then think of getting new apartments, after the 1st of May? I suppose Jeff has settled about the lot—it seems to me first rate as an investment—the kind of house to build is quite a consideration, (if any house,) I should build a regular Irish shanty myself, two rooms, and an end shed—I think that's luxury enough, since I have been down in the army.Well, mother, I believe I will not fill out the sheet this time, as I want to go down without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter, and this one.Good bye, dear mother,Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 6 February 1863"
