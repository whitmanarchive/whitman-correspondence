    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,16 March 1890Here I am over at my office in the main Asylum sitting at my desk with a fine wood and coal fire at my left hand—every thing snug and comfortable. Have attended chapel this morning and spent near three hours in here since. Have written a number of letters. Spent a while puzzling over the \"Riddle Song\" (I wish I could find the answer to it—I suppose you will never tell it?)—read some pages of Browning \"Paracelsus\" and now finish the forenoon writing this note (for it is dinner time and I must go over to the house). W.J. Gurd & Self have been hard at workon the meter and we think that at last we shall get it under way. We have decided to form (have taken the first steps for that purpose) a company—sell stock—get tools made—start a factory here—build up a business if possible—move the meter by placing it in actual use—then launch out in the States, England & as we see our way. We began selling stock yesterday and sold $1000. worth—we only want to raise $5000. or $6000. That sum will get what tools we want and start us in a small way here—if the meter sells we shall have no difficulty in increasing our capital and enlarging our operationsR M Buckesomething of a blizzard here since last night. Blowing & snowing. More like winter than any time since last November.RMB Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 March 1890"
