    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street cor. West. Camden, N.New Jersey, Feb.February 24.Dear Nelly,I am sitting here alone in the front room—a cold, gusty, wintry day outside, but bright & sunshiny—have just read your good letter of the 22d—Nothing special or different about my sickness or condition—I keep on much in the same way—gastric & liver trouble pretty grave, & (as a resultant) head distress more than half the time—go about though—The baby is getting along well—though there are better, & fatter, & handsomer babies, this one is fine enough for all practicable purposes, is well formed, & has (I think) an especially fine pair of eyes—Knows me, & seems to like to be tended to occasionally held by me—begins to laugh, & [] [not at] all nervous or scareable—[] though (cant [] altogether satis[factory] [] [de?]formed one, has been [] foot, but is now nearly [] been steady—I have tended it—My sister and brother Geo:George are well—My other sisters, nieces, & brother Jeff, were well at last accounts. I am glad you wrote me about your mother. John Burroughs visited me some weeks since, on his way home from Wash'nWashington. Miss Kate Hillard wrote me she is to be in Phila.Philadelphia on her way to Wash'nWashingtonWashington 26th to 29th Feb.February in Clinton st.Street near 10th, & I am going over, 27th, to spend a couple of hours, as I know the folks. (Mrs. and Prof. and Miss Lesley.) As Hector Tyndale lives only two or three doors from there, I shall look in on him, or at least make some inquiry—& will send you word. The N.Y. Tribune of last Saturday (19th Feb.February) had the 2½ column synopsis of my new book, pretty full & fair—I suppose the Star extracts you mention must have come from it—M. D. Conway has not yet gone back to London—goes on two or three weeks—How about Chas: Eldridge? Remembrance to Mrs. Brownell, Mrs. Huntington, Mrs. Johnson & Miss Donaldson, & best love to you, Nelly dear— Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 24 February [1876]"
