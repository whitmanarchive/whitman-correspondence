    "text": "Washington, July 25, 1867. Dear boy & comrade, It is a long while since I have written to you—I believe it is six months, or over—but you must not think I have forgotten you—I have thought of you often, & wished we could be together. Al, I believe the last letter I got from you was last April. I went home about that time to Brooklyn, N. Y., & remained home quite a long time—one of my brothers, (who had been a soldier & all through the war, in the 9th Corps,) was sick with erysipelas, & lay very low for a while—but has recovered. My Mother, & the rest of the folks, are all well. I have had good health since I last wrote to you. I am still working in the Attorney General's Office, here—I am writing this letter at my desk in the office, seated by the same old open window, where I can look out & have a splendid view of the Potomac river, & the hills & trees & banks, for miles & miles. It looks pleasant enough—but we are having it very hot indeed, just now—last night was very oppressive—then the air is so close & stale in the city in hot weather any how—I sometimes feel as I could hardly breathe. Alfred, I suppose you read in the papers about the trial of John H. Surratt for taking part in the murder of President Lincoln. I went down to the trial, day before yesterday. Surratt is very young—I sat near him & looked at him a long time—he sits most of the time fanning himself with a big palm leaf fan, & watches the witnesses with his sharp eyes—& his brother, a young farmer-looking man from Texas, sits close by him. The lawyers on both sides are very smart—sometimes the evidence goes strongly against him, & then again for him. It is very interesting to sit & hear the witnesses & the speeches of the lawyers. It has been a tedious trial, & it is hard to tell how it will end. Al, you mentioned about your father buying a new farm, last spring. You must tell me how it goes—& also how you are getting along yourself, for I want to hear every thing, & all the particulars about you. Tell your father & mother I would write to them, but I suppose writing to you is almost the same. I send them my love, & a full share to you, dearest comrade. My address is the same as you directed your former letters. Well, I must draw to a close. Alfred, your love for me, & the kind invitations you have sent me, & from the kind father & mother also, to come & pay you all a visit, are fully appreciated by me. I hope & intend to come & see you all, one of these days. Write & let me know if you get this. Farewell, my darling boy, & God bless you, & bless the dear parents also. Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to Alfred Pratt, 25 July 1867"
