    "text": "Monday Morning. July 18. 1864.Dear Walt,If no more raids, invasions, incursions, no more new developments in the Ginnaty affair, no more detentions by fire or water occur, my plan is to leave at 6:30 to-morrow evening. I shall get into New York about an hour later than usual, & put my baggage upon the Stonington Boat to leave that Wednesday evening and I shall in on the boat in good time, it leaves at 5 P.M. & I will be there by three P.M. I can say, unless the omnibus that takes me down town should smash up, or something like it. So if you are able I shall be very, very glad to see you & have a good talk with you while I wait.Don't come unless you are able, but if you are I shall rejoice to see you.Of course I do not ask you to meet me when I get in on Tuesday morning because I know it would be too much for you, & because Mr. Howells has said he would, but it would be good to have a whole day with you if you were well. I shall go to some place & get a breakfast, & be under Mr. Howells' supervision.Good bye. Charlie got your last letter. He did hope to get away, but can't.With love -Nelly. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 18 July 1864"
