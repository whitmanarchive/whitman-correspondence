    "text": "134 East 38th St, New York,Jan 23/1874My beloved Walt—I had read thy sublime poem of the \"Universal\" once and again, and yet again—seeing it in the Graphic, Post, Mail, World, and among other papers.It is sublime.It raised my mind to its own sublimity.It seems to me the sublimest of all your poems.I cannot help reading it every once of a while.I return to it as a fountain of joyMy beloved Walt.—You know how I have worshipped you, without change or cessation, for twenty years.While my soul Exists, the worship must be Ever new.It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition the \"Leaves of Grass\" that I saw a copy of it at at a newspaper stand in Fulton street Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that there was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into me.—I expected certainly to go down to Camden last fall to see you.But something prevented. And, in time, I saw in the poems that just hard reward.—In New Year took me with a new friend of action among the miserables.Oh, what scenes of human horror were to be found in this city last winter.—I cannot tell you how much I was engaged, or all I did for twelve months.I must wait till I see you to tell you about these story's[stories]story's. I have been going toward social radicalism of later years, and appeared more of the Academy of lately on Primort and oratoring the meeting. How I would like to see you, in order to temper my heat, and expand my narrownessHow absurd it is to suppose that there is any interest in the brain of a man who can generate the poems of The \"Universal\"I would and say that same kind of ailment ought to spread.My beloved Walt—Tell me if you would like me to come to see you, and heretofor I can do so within a few weeks.Yours alwaysJohn Swinton John Swinton to Walt Whitman, 23 January 1874"
