    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,25 Oct 1889I have your cards of 21st & 22d (one came in morning other in afternoon yesterday) also Daily Telegraph of 7th. That is a grand letter of Arnolds, one of the best (most useful) letters we have had when you consider the writer and the enormous circulation it will have. I feel quite set up over it. No sign of Ed. Wilkins here yet—he must have gone home (lives some miles from here in country) and no doubt he will be here today or tomorrow. I was out in country pretty much all yesterday seeing an old friend who is sick. Yes, I should be glad to see the \"Critic\" whenever you have one that you neither want to keep nor to send to someone else—It is a paper I always feel interested in looking over. A thousand thanks for your assurance as to the 1872 L. of G. and also for the prospect of \"Harrington\" which I sincerely hope you may some day find. All well here, no further word from Willy Gurd in re meter but I am satisfied that all is well in that quarter. We are all well.Love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 October 1889"
