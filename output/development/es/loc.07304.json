    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the Insane,London, Ont.,28 May 1889Yours of 25th & 26th just to hand with its enclosures the little (welcome) photo of 1863 and the Critic cutting. I enclose to you (at her request, as you will see) Mrs O'Connor's letter of 25th (came to hand yesterday).The dinner is drawing near (wish much I could be present), I trust it will be a big success and do not doubt it will be. Trust they will carry out their idea of printing speeches in a little pamphlet as I should enjoy reading them all greatly.Our Annual Ball comes off 30th (Thursday evening) it is going to be quite an affair—altogether the best we have had I think.Last Thursday evening I went to Sarnia—next morning my brother Julius, my nephew Fred. Kittermaster, and myself went thirty miles down the St Clair river on a steamboat taking with us a sailboat, provisions &c (fishing tackle of course). From Robert's landing (30 ms. below Sarnia) we sailed (in our small boat) some 20 ms. further down the Chanail Ecarté (a stream which puts out of the St Clair)—spent two days fishing and camping about the shores of Lake St Clair—we had a grand time, caught some black bass, perch, and a big pike and a rock bass. We sailed across Lake St Clair from Mitchell's Bay to Star Island Home (15 ms.) took steam-boat there and back to Sarnia Sunday evening—Home here Monday noon and found the Inspector waiting for me—hard at work sinceR M Buckesee notes May, '89 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 May 1889"
