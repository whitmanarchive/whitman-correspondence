    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden N J July 27 '84Dear friendYour letters have been rec'd & Alys's also—& have given me comfort—So full of living buoyancy & youth—I see those qualities—or the tally of them—are the important matter, & then the circumstances & happenings may be whatever may chance—The son [—] a friend of mine [—] of the proprietor of the paper here asked me to \"help him out\" in yesterday's paper—so I gave him the letter to print—I enclose you the slip—how well & off-hand it reads —I am living here in my den in Mickle Street the same as ever—A little episode—the 9-month-old baby grandson of Mrs. Lay (my housekeeper) was attacked with cholera infantum & brain trouble a week ago—the doctor insisted on a change of locale—they lived in hot close rooms—so the babe & mother & two other children are here the past week—& the babe (an exceptionally fine one), is out of danger—but it has been a close shave—the doctor comes twice a day—says it has been this house & back yard, (very nice & breezy—we have had a hammock swung there), that has done most of the curing—Are you interested in the episode? I have been much.Love to Alys, Logan & all—W W Walt Whitman to Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, 27 July 1884"
