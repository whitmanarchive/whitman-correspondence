    "text": "Washington D. C.March 31 1868My Dear Sir:The little essay in The \"Galaxy\" is hardly deserving the attention you give it; yet its author is not insensible to the opinion of so accomplished a critic as yourself. Let me thank you for your expressions of interest and appreciation.I certainly had no design to disparage genius & culture much less to attack them but only to call up and emphasise other points—as it were put in a plea for the ground work, when nearly everybody is soliciting only about the pattern. The older I grow the more disposed I am to subordinate the author to the man, and the less satisfaction I have in mere literacy or scholastic attainments. I see that literature is served, perhaps alone deeply and finally served, by other things than literary culture. Tried by purely artistic standards, we should be obliged to pronounce half a dozen current poets great. The reason they are not great is because they are deficient as men. They have the knack, they have all that culture can do, and yet there is not one life giving word in them. It was this idea which I tried to make the point of the essay. I cannot but feel that at least the tone and spirit of current criticism is \"antagonistic\" to this suggestion. As an opinion or an abstract statement, no doubt most persons would asscent to it; but let it be carried out in literature, let a poet or artist appear, who shall not aim to express mere book culture, or any of the artificial phases of our civilization—its exclusions from the air, the sun, the Earth, but to open up the abysses of primative[primitive] power and feeling, and quicken and fertilize the spirit as nature does, and what would the critics say, even the best of them? I demand therefore that literature shall express more than literature, more than what is usually meant by genius or refinement, or intellect, be it the best in the world. Indeed when I think of a supreme work or poem, I have in my mind one in which all these things are lost, and the total impression of which is the spirit of manly action and performance. The greatest poem savors of nothing indoors, nothing conventional, no premeditated polish, no craft, or model, not even art, but of the spirit of universal nature. It is something like this that draws me to the Greek poets. If I could read them in the original no doubt I should be much more sensible of it. What impresses me particularly in Aeschylus is his stern moral grandeur. His polish if he has such never obtrudes itself upon my attention.It seems to me almost useless to attempt anything in the usual complacent Addisonian style at this time and in this country, at least write a view to promote American literature thereby. I see no possible chance for a national literature here, until we have something deep cut and original, some tremendous overwhelming genius and man, whose plowshare shall completely obliterate all this pretty ornamental scratching of garden tools at the surface and open up the soil for new and hardy crops. He must be coarse and broad as well as subtle and absorptive, and above all things audacious. Violence must be done. These deft and dainty gentlemen who think such a punch luck as \"Katharena\" a great poem must be shocked, and larger and more robust standards must be introduced.I find it easy, as you see, to predict the man we need when I believe in the living example before me. My prophecy follows the fact. My admiration for Walt Whitman has been of too gradual a growth and the source of too much moral and spiritual help to me for me ever to suspect that I have either over estimated, or misestimated him. I find him, on long and intimate acquaintance, even more suggestive and significant, as a man than as an author. Indeed he is, in his personal make and presence, the curious counterpart of his Book, and I doubt if I could ever have come to a complete understanding of the one without the other. Among other things his glory is that in an age when almost every book and poem is of a pathological character—the result of some mental or spiritual disease, or of some one faculty pushed beyond its legitimate sphere of development, he has produced a vast work which is perfectly consistent with the health and wholeness of the individual. Leaves of Grass is the rare \"phenomenon\" of a work of the imagination and the intellect which is an actual stay to human longevity and strength. It is not a thought but an act, as creation is, and this is my definition of a supreme work of art. All the great poems are like deeds, and imply the same totality of the human being. In this way they are moral without having any direct moral aim; and poetical and intellectual in the same manner. I have written a little book about the poet which I shall take the liberty to send you.I yield to more in my admiration for Hawthorne as a writer, as a manipulator of words. Yet I cannot say that he has ever been of much help to me, as Emerson has and as Whitman still has. Hawthorne is exceptional; he does not stand in the regular order of things; he is not great on the common grounds, and I cannot think that such as he betoken the general soundness and well-being of the race, as Whitman does. I think even Thoreau is a more auspicious sign.You see I am determined to hold part to the manhood test. There are enough to exalt polish, and art, and scholarship, so far as my voice goes it shall be raised only for that which goes forward with human life and strength.Very Truly YoursJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 31 March 1868"
