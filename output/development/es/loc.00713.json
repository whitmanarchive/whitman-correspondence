    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington,May 4, 1866.My dear friend, Your contribution of $20 for the soldiers in hospital, sick or wounded, has been received—& I thank you for it most sincerely. I shall apply it to their aid, faithfully & with care.I was out to Harewood yesterday week, & last Sunday—the patients have however since been removed to another place, near the Old Douglas hospital. Then there are the Providence hospital, & the 5th Reg. Cavalry, & some other small, military hospitals.There are comparatively few soldiers now that need ministering to, but full enough to occupy one's spare hours—& especially as half of the inmates of the hospitals are discharged soldiers, drawing no pay, though sick, or suffering sometimes very deeply indeed, from relapses of old wounds.I wish you health, my friend, in body & in spirit. Farewell.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Garaphelia Howard, 4 May 1866"
