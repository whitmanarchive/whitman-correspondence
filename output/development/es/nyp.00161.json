    "text": "Dear Father,As I always wish to fulfill my promises I will enjoy this afternoon in writing a letter in order to let you know how I got home and how my health is So I left Washington that evening at 5 Oc and got to Baltimore at 7 and left at 6 and got to Harisburg[Harrisburg] at two in the night. I changed cars and was off in a few minutes in the morning of the 4th Wednesday a train just a head of us run off track and was hurt which throwed[threw] us back six hours we ought to have got to Pittsburg[Pittsburgh] at one that day But did not get in until after six then I had to wait until two in the night But I was glad of it. I went to the Soldiers Home and got my supper and took a good sleep I left Pittsburg[Pittsburgh] a little after 2 after that we run right through I got to Bucyrus just in time for dinner. I had good luck there was one of my Fathers old acquaintances there in a bugy[buggy] [took me] straight on home to the door whar[where] I had a grand interunion[reunion] with my friends I found all of them in good health they were a little supprised[surprised] to see me but they had been looking for me every day for a long time everything is a month behind things in Washington It snowed all day this Monday the roads are very bad people are just getting their roads [open] the trees are just beginning to put forth their leafs. If my friend is in the Hospital yet tell him I got home all right I guess I will close by biding you good by for this time and request from you to send a letter in return at some later time.I am very respectfully your soldier boy Isaac Livensparger, Address Lykens, Crawford Co[unty] Ohio Isaac Livensparger to Walt Whitman, 7 May 1864"
