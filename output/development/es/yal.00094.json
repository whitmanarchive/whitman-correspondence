    "text": "BrooklynJuly 9 1864My dear friendI rec'd the letters this afternoon, two in the envelope with a note from you. I wrote to William some five days ago—has he not rec'd it? I had grown worse, quite a good deal, & I was about making up my mind that I would have to stand a good seige[siege]—but yesterday the current changed, & I felt better all day, & in the afternoon went out riding with my brother, the first time I have been out of the house since I got home—& to-day I remain feeling better.The doctor to-day tells me my throat is markedly better—In my letter to William I told him I had rec'd his—I have also rec'd one from Nelly—it was very welcome, & I shall try to answer it soon—When you write tell me the impressions you got in the army, & the probabilities as far as you can make them out—As to me, I still believe in Grant, & that we shall get Richmond—we have heard from my brother to July 2—tell me about Ashton—in a day or two as I get strength I shall probably go down the island—Walt Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 9 July 1864"
