HALSTED STREET. 83 MADISON STREET.151 RANDOLPH STREET.112 MONROE STREET. 161 W. MADISON STREET.ChicagoJune 1st1889My Dear Old FriendThe enclosed I clipped from the Inter Ocean today, and as this is my 48th birthday, I am prompted by old recolections[recollections] to write you a few lines congratulating you on your 70th birthday. I hope you will long and prosper. This brings me back to 27 years ago when I used to see your sturdy form and kindly face in Washington. I don't know that you will remember me but I think you will. Do you remember the young man of the 5th US CavalaryCavalry who you used to visit in Armory Square Hospital and the many times you used to take me into a Restaurant and give me a good square meal. I suppose you done that to so many you would hardly remember me by that. for all Soldiers know[known] to you looked upon you as their friend, for you ever wore your heart on your sleeve to Old Soldier boys. You used to call me leady thin. I well rember[remember] the last time I saw you it was in in the street in New York you had a little girl with you at the time, and readily recognised me. Well I have not changed so very much only of course somewhat older. hair sprinkled somewhat with gray. Your hair cannot be much more white than it was in the long ago. I hope you are in good healthy and may continue so to a good round old age. for you deserve it well an dyou also deserve well of your country. for you were ever a friend of the Soldier and of your country. 27 years and what history for the U.S has been written in that time. For the years gone by I have often passed through Camden, and had I known it was your home I should surely have stopped to see you, that I might once more have crasped[clasped] you by the hand and looked into that kindly face and fought over our battles (once again) in Washington. I would like very much to hear from you. should you remember once and have the leisure and should I in the future be near Camden. I will certainly do myself the pleasure of calling on you.Bleive[Believe] meYours Sincerly[Sincerely]MC Reed222 So Clark stChicago Ill Milford C. Reed to Walt Whitman, 1 June 1889"
