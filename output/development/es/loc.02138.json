I want the authority to say some of these things. They will do you good. The first few pages will be taken up with a bit of description of the Banquet and so on—The rest of the letter is a free report of what we talked about in my visits to you. If any part of this displeases you, or misrepresents you—mark it—or indicate it to Mr. Traubel and return it to me.Hartman, and others have done so much to misrepresent you in the papers that I wish to present something counter which shall help men to understand you. I wish you would read Mr. Howells later books—and essays, he is taking fearlessly high grounds.If you dont feel like writing, ask Traubel to reply.Everybody here sends well wishes—Baxter—Chamberlain—Clement etc—With greatest esteem—Hamlin Garland.See notes Oct 20, 1888 Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, [June 1889]"
