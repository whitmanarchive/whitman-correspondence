Mother said it was the best letter she ever read—How I wish I was with you—I dearly love to Travel—Camden is dull, very dull, and painfully hot—I hear from Loui Odenheimer—not directly, but through some of her relations, that she is no better—what a sad thing to happen to a Girl of her age and prospects—The Boys around the Ferry miss you greatly—I hear them talking about you often—I know Trim Hand one of the Pilots—He and Hiskey are very fond of you—I suppose you will be away for some lenghth[length] of time yet—Do write occasionally, and send some papers too, for we all like to hear from you, when you are so far away from us—All the family send love and hope for your safe return to us benefitted[benefited] by your trip—With loveHarry Scovelfrom Harry Scovel June 26 '80 Harry Scovel to Walt Whitman, 22 June 1880"
