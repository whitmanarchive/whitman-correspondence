    "text": "54, Manchester Road,Bolton.Lancashire, England.Decr, 13th 1890.Dear Walt Whitman,Thanks to you for your kind p.c + for your long + interesting letter both of which I received yesterday—I am much grieved to hear of the death of your brother Jefferson which must have been a heavy blow to you + one which I am sure you would feel most acutely. On behalf of the friends here + myself I desire to tender you our sincere + heartfelt sympathy in your sore bereavement. May the Great-Healer + Consoler pour His into your wounded heart + give you of his sweet Peace + Comfort!I am also extremely sorry to hear of your continued indisposition + I hope that by this time things have taken a more favourable turn with you + that your strong faith + your vast store of long suffering patience, indomitable pluck and hopeful joyousness may bear you through these \"gloomy blue days\" as they have done so often before.I received a good letter from Dr Bucke yesterday in which he gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a brother medico.I am glad that you like + endorse my Notes + I thank you cordially for your kindly remarks concerning them.It may interest you to know that \"the boys\" gave me a \"surprise party\" on the Evening of Dec. 8th—my birthday—+ presented me with a handsome \"Literary machine\"—a reading + writing stand—bearing a brass plate engraved \"To John Johnston, Esq. M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys of the College. Bolton, Dec. 8th 1890.\"After the presentation + speeches R K Greenhalgh consecrated the stand by reading aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W. Wallace—characterised as a Chieftan's call to arms—rousing us to a sense of the value + importance of our little Society of Friends + urging upon us the necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual manly love + true Comradeship + the cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest of the evening was spent in merriment—songs recitations + social converse—two original humourous songs about \"the Doctor\" being contributed by W. Dixon.By this mail I am sending a parcel of Christmas literature for you + some of the other members of your household; also a copy of this week's Bolton Journal containing a short paragraph anent a pleasant evening we had at the Bolton Art Club when I gave the members + their friends an account of my visit to you +c, + exhibited your photo + I took in America upon a 10 ft screen.I saw Fred. Wild last night. He sends his love + his sympathy to you + asked me to order a copy of the pocket book edition of L. of G. for him. His address is—Mr Fred. Wild, 24, Arrowsmith Terrace, Bolton, Lancashire, England, + I should be obliged if you would kindly send the book to him direct.Many thanks to you for kindly sending Mr Johnston's copy.I shall have great pleasure in sending a copy of my Notes to each of the friends whose names + addresses you have kindly favoured me with.With best love to you + kindest regards to all the members of your household + wishing you all a \"Merry Christmas + a Happy New Year!\"RemainYours affectionatelyJ JohnstonP.S. I have just heard that J W W has recd Lippincott's Magazine from you John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 13 December 1890"
