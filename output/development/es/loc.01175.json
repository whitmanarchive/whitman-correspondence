    "text": "West Park N.Y.Feb. 27, 1890Dear Walt:Here I am back from Pokeepsie[Poughkeepsie] in my little study to-night with a maple & hickory fire burning in the open fire place & thinking of you. This little shanty is a real solitude. Cut off from the house & standing alone here on the brow of the hill. A wild rabbit lives under the floor & the wild wood will scamper over head. But few of my friends havevisited me here, but here I sit by my open fire & have long long thoughts of them. How I make them come trooping in. How many times have I planted you there in my big chair by the window, or here in front of the open fire & talked the old talk with you. Alas, alas, that I should never see you here in the body as well as in the spirit. I talk at O'Connors picture & think of him too so often, the brilliant one whom I shall see no more.How sacred is memory! as we grow old how much he lives in the past, how trivial & cheap seems the present. A tender & beautiful light fills my mind when I think of those years in Washington when we were all there; a light I know that never was on sea or land. How solemn & pathetic, as well as beautiful it must seem to you, considering all you passed through there!Chas. Eldridge sends me his wedding cards from California. I am glad he is married & hope he is happy & prosperous. I must write to him. Give himmy love if you write him. I think I told you we were housekeeping in Pokeepsie[Poughkeepsie] for the winter. Mrs B & Julian are there now, but I am back in my form & at work for the past two days, & I find it much better than hanging about the miserable little city. My winter has been flat stale & unprofitable. I mean to delve the earth with vigor now to make up for it. I have seen nobody nor been anywhere. Should probably have gone to W. had not wife been sick for 5 weeks with the gripe. I get a glimpse of you now & then in the paper. I hope you are comfortable. Do drop me a card if you can, or ask Trauble[Traubel] to write me. Our winter has been a perpetual spring as I suppose yours has.With the old loveJ Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 27 February 1890"
