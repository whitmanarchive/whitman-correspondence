Walt, Whitman, esqDear Sir!I will postpone no longer to thank you for your kind letter of 7 Dec. It was in my hands two days before the beginning of the new year. Your \"leaves of grass\" Clausen has already sent me; but the other papers—especially your \"democratic vistas\"—shall be very welcome. I wonder, that they have not arrived yet, and hope, that they have not miscarried on the way. This unexpected delay makes me very sorry; my mind is full of your poems, but naturally I won't beginn[begin] to write before having in my hands as complete materials as possibly[possible].Hans Christian Andersen would perhaps not make you very great joy, if you did know him personally. Björnson would be your man, he is a dear friend of mine and coeditor of the periodical. At present he is living in Christiania.The enclosed portrait is no bad photography, but a photographical portrait is never truly a good one.Most truly yoursRudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 5 January 1872"
