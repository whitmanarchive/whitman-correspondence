    "text": "Tuesday evening—Jan 23—Mother, I wrote yesterday in my letter that I had a bad cold—I felt quite disagreeable yesterday, but went to bed early, & had a good sleep—to-day, Tuesday, I have felt all right.It has been snowing some here to-day—I have been out walking though—it is not cold—As I write this, I am sitting here in the office, (Treasury solicitor's) at 8 o'clock—have been reading & writing all by myself—Mother, you get Mrs. Bruce to give you Gracie's address in Iowa—I have just got some nice copies of my Am. Institute piece from Boston, & I will send her one—let Mr. or Mrs. Bruce write the address on a slip of paper and you enclose it in your next—The last time I saw Arthur Price here he invited me to come down to the Navy yard here to visit his vessel, the Mahopac—so Saturday, after I left work, I went down—but found myself a day after the fair—the vessel had gone about an hour before I got there—I believe she has gone to NorfoldNorfolk.Mother, on those envelopes you have you just cross out, draw a line over this way, when you send them, & leave the rest, (like you did your last)—and they will come safe—I got your letter this morning—it is too bad the letter Mat sent Christmas was lost—that was a real nice present of a barrel of flour—Poor Mat, I feel real blue to think of her condition—but perhaps she will come round yet—and may be live as long as any of us—Well, mama dear, I will close for to-night & finish it to-morrow—Wednesday afternoon Jan. 24Mother, I am feeling well to-day—I think my cold must have been a false alarm, or else I have got off very easy—The weather is bitter cold here to-day, but bright & clear—What do you hear from George—I kind of hope he will not go to Milwaukee—should not wish to have him & Lou live so far away, unless the inducement is very great—Nothing new in the office—I like this place just as well as the other—I have not a room to myself, it is true—We are pretty well crowded—they are mostly young men, & a good deal of noise & moving about—but I don't mind it, as it is only from 9 to 3—& my work is much easier—Has Eddy got well of his cold?I shall probably be on hand to eat some of Mat's cake—Good bye for to-day, mother dear—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 23–24 January [1872]"
