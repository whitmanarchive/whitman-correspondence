    "text": "South BostonJan 9 - 85My Dear friend,I hope you will pardon me for not acknowledging the books sooner, I did not write for reasons I will not stop to inumerateenumerate here.They came safely, and in good condition, and I am happy in the possession of them. You sent me more than I expected. I thank you for that, also for the picture.Christmas brought me a new photograph album, and I dedicated it with this you sent me.\"If you come to Boston,\" Does this imply a doubt? So it seems to me. Come if you can. Come when you can. I suppose Boston in winter has fewer attractions than some other Cities, but from Spring to Autumn, I know her temples for miles around, are as varied, and beautiful, as the grand old architect could make them.Of course \"Jack Frost\" holds the key to many of these now. Still there's always something everywhere to make this old world a beatitude.No doubt your friend has returned to Cambridge, tho' I have not seen her; I shall try to do so sometime soon.I am glad you are in good spirits, and fair health. I wish your powers of locomotion was as good. For such let us pray.Your friend very truly,A.B. Drake. A.B. Drake to Walt Whitman, 9 January 1885"
