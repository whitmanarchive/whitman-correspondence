    "text": "Brooklyn, N. Y.,Sept. 29th 1865Dear brother WaltWe hav'nt[haven't] heard from you for some time—you say the bundle was not the right one—I read the label and thought it read the same as you described in your letter—would you like me to send the other or right one if I can find it—Mother told me she knew the one you meant and that she would put it on the table for me—that is the one I sentWe had a letter from Mother to-day—she seems pretty well—talks a little of coming home but does not say when—I have just written her this eve—We are all as well as usual—the baby has a bad boil on its forehead but I suppose it will get well in a day or two and then she will be all right again—it looks just now though about as bad as anything of the kind I ever saw  by-the-way it was me that had the \"run around\" on the finger—and I have just got well of it—and a cussed bad time I had of it too—it accounts for my not writing you before—George is getting along first rate I guess—He dont[don't] say any more about getting a position in the Custom House—I hope he wont try but I am quite sure that if he can keep devoted to his present undertaking he will make a handsome fortune in 8 or ten years—he certainly has the prospect of it—there is an immense amount of building in the city this season—though material is wonderful high—brick $12 per thousand—should be abt[about] 5 or 6—I have given up all thought of building this fall—at one time I thought I would sure  perhaps next spring will be betterMatters about Brooklyn are much the same—with me just the same—Mr Kirkwood has been on a visit to Brooklyn and just gone back to St. Louis—I think it more than likely that he will build the water works of that city—if so it will be as large a job as the Brooklyn worksThe Doctor returned from the country last week—he looks first rate—says he had a wonderfully good time—he was spending the summer up in Vermont near Burlington—speaks of it as being a splendid place to live—In her letter to-day Mother says she wants either you or George to come on and come home with her—so I suppose she begins to think of coming homeMattie and the children desire to send their love to you—the child[ren] are growing first rate—I wish you would write me  I want to know how things are going with youaffectionately Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 29 September 1865"
