I should not want to leave to my children the name of a Stevens or a Marston.There is no need of telling you that your friends here are with you cordially. I enclose you editorial scraps and an interview I had with Oscar Wilde in which I drew him out on \"Leaves of Grass.\"Let me hear from you once in a while.Your friendFred R Guernsey.Say, friend Walt: Will you not write a note to our editor in chief Mr. E. B. Haskell in acknowledgment of his defense of you? Fred R. Guernsey to Walt Whitman, 26 May 1882"
