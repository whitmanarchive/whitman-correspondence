    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,23 Dec 1888Yours of 20th, dear Walt, came yesterday evening. Yes, I am thoroughly satisfied with the big book and more and more (if possible) as I look it over. I think it will stand in future ages as the cheif glory of the nineteenth century. Yes, I have no doubt I get all your letters and papers &c also—I shall be very glad to hear of O'C. if you have any thing from there to send me—I fear he is very sick, I wrote him lately a letter that ought to have been answered and I think would have been if he had been able, but it was not—this makes me anxious. No sign of Wm Gurd and no further letters from him. No sleighing so far, we have had a few days cold but mild again today—not much of a winter so far. All goes quietly here, we are preparing for Xmas.What will you have for your Xmas dinner? Roast turkey and plum pudding is the regular thing here but you will hardly be up to that this year. But by new year I am in hopes you will be in pretty fair shape again. The sun is out warm and bright—looks almost like a spring day out doors. From the two far corners of my office (where I am sitting) the 1st & 2d heads look down upon me grandly & calmly.I am, dear Walt, your friendR M Buckesee notes 12/26/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 December 1888"
