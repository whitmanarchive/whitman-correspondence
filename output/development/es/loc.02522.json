    "text": "54, Manchester RoadBolton, England. Oct 10/91 My Dear old Friend, My best thanks to you for your kind letter written on the back page of one of Dr Bucke's to you & for JWW's letter to you all of wh came to hand two days ago. Glad to know that things continue on the better side with you—\"the same subject continued, perhaps a little plus\" says your letter—& I sincerely trust that your discomforts are really & permanently lessened. I had a dear good letter from H.L.T. the other day in wh he says that you \"bear your world (not Atlas-like) without a bent shoulder\"—a very apt phrase wh exactly pictures you in your old age hearing worlds of trouble, distress, pain &c wh. would crush ordinary mortals earthwards. What a lesson are you to us all & how thankful we ought to be for all that you have been to us! I have had a busy week of it & this has been an exceptionally busy day—two midwifery cases & an inquest in addition to my ordinary round of visiting, prescribing, consulting & dispensing for heaps of patients— more or less ill & more or less grateful for the services they receive. What a tale does my Ledger tell! The doctor's an angel of light when we're ill.But the devil himself—when he sends his bill!Blest is the doctor who gets his feeWhen the tear is ee! No news of the clay head yet. I suppose I shall be hearing one of these days. Hope it has not been disposed of beyond recovery. I presume J.W.W. is at Camden now enjoying the hospitality & society of H.L.T. and his winsome wife & an occasional talk with you. How I do envy him his good luck! My love to you! Best respects to all your household. Yours affectionately J.Johnston John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 10 October 1891"
