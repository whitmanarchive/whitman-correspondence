You can't imagine how sorry I was to hear how worried you have been about me, and all the while I was as well as ever, so you see how foolish it is to frett[fret],  the most trouble that I have, is thinking that you are worrying about me,  so you see Mother if you would do as I say, and not frett[fret] we would both have less trouble. Mother why dont[don't] you write to a fellow  I have not had a letter from you in a long time. I hope you have everything comfortable there at home. I should be mad as blazes if I knew you did not use the money I sent on, for anything you need, whenever you want clothing or anything else  dont[don't] be afraid to use the money for there is plenty more where that came from, so go in lemons, and remember your galliant[gallant] Son is a Capting[Camptain], and expects you to keep up the dignity of the family, and darn the expense.Mother I wish you would send me $10 by mail as soon as conveinent[convenient],  I have over two months pay due me, but we shall probaly[probably] not get paid in some time yet. dont[Don't] fail to write to me as soon as you get this, and dont[don't] forget the good advice in the good book about fretting.Good Night Dear MotherGeo.
