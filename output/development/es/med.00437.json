    "text": "431 Stevens St. cor. West, Camden, N. Jersey May 2. Dear John Burroughs,I send you a letter, &c. I rec'd from Dowden, as you are alluded to. I have written to Dowden, today, & sent it off—so I suppose he will send you the books alluded to. Mine have arrived—Dowden advances, expands, or rather penetrates—the first two Chapters of his ShakespereShakespeare, which I have read thoroughly, are very fine—(I have underlined passages on every page) —the Victor Hugo I have not yet read —. . . I am pretty strong yet, & go out—but head, stomach & liver, all in a bad way, & seems as if nothing could bring them round. Have rec'd a long & good letter from Rossetti which I will show you when you come. How are you getting along? How is 'Sula? . . . Walt Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 2 May [1875]"
