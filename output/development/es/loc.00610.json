    "text": "Cedar LakeOct 22nd 1865My Dear Friend,Tis a long time since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you so I fear you did not receive the letter I sent on receipt of your photographs quite a good while ago so I will write a short letter again hoping better luck this time. I am getting around quite lively on just a single cane and my health is good. I am quite strong but not very fleshy as you will observe by the enclosed pho[tograph], which you may think was a long time coming I am getting ready to day for a short journey out to Livingston Co. to visit some relatives and friends so you must be so kind as to excuse this short note.I have not heard from Fraser in a number of weeks but hope you have seen him much oftener. The last time he wrote he was a little better but thought he would be able to leave hospital at the expiration of 1865, but I most earnestly hope he will not be obliged to remain so long.Tis very pleasant to day but pretty cold. I write this not knowing but you may have left the place you were but shall use the envelope which you sent me. I would like much to see you again and have a good visit once more and I pray that we meet sometime.I received a letter from Wood a few days since, he is visiting Tommy (No. 6) he was quite well and enjoying himself well, said Tommy had a pleasant home and they were having a good time generally. Now good bye, my good friend and may heaven keep you safe from harm. Anson Ryder, Jun. Anson Ryder Jr. to Walt Whitman, 22 October 1865"
