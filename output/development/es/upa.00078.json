    "text": "Original Letter328 Mickle StreetCamden New Jersey U S AmericaAugust 1 '85Dear Herbert GilchristYours of July 21 just rec'd, soliciting some definite word from me ab't an English or transatlantic \"free will offering\"—a proposed affectionate and voluntary gift to me from my friends there. I feel deeply, even for the prompting of it, and should decidedly and gratefully accept any thing it produces. (My publisher David McKay, of Philadelphia, has just been over to pay the last half-annual royalty on my two Volumes Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days, which amounted to twenty-two dollars and six cents—this being the income to me from the sale of my books for the last six months.)Fearfully hot weather here. I have had a sunstroke which has made me weak, and kept me indoors for the last twelve days; but I move around the house, eat my rations fairly, write a little, and shall quite certainly soon resume my usual state of health, late times—(doubtless lower'd a slight notch or two, as I find that is the way things go on year after year.) Fortunately I have a good faithful young Jersey woman and friend, Mary Davis, who cooks for me, and vigilantly sees to me.Give my love to Wm M. Rossetti and to all enquiring friends, known or unknown.You are at liberty to make any use of this letter you see fit.Walt WhitmanSprague Collection No 34W. #18 Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, 1 August 1885"
