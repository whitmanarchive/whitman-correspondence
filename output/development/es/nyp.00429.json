    "text": "CamdenFeb: 24 AfternoonDear Hank—I feel to write you a card, but I guess it will be a dry one, for I have nothing to write about, & I havn't[haven't] got very smart yet—I go out though—(Seems to me if I couldn't go out in the sun & open air I should give up entirely)—How did you make out with the piece for the Lyceum? I suppose you rec'dreceived what I sent you—the extracts on poetry—did you make a piece and read it as I told you? (I'll bet five dollars you didn't do any thing of the kind)—I rec'dreceived a pamphlet from Edward Carpenter to-day—his forthcoming lectures for 1881—perhaps he sent you one—I have been in all day, occupying myself reading & writing a little—Shall go out now for a couple of hours—There I told you this would be a dry letter—Walt Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 24 February [1881]"
