    "text": "see notes April 2 1903The Pilot Editorial Rooms.Boston.Feb. 11th 1885Dear Mr. Whitman, I have received the enclosed letter today, from one of the ablest men I have ever known; & I send it to you as another little proof that Irishmen understand & honor you. I hope you are well. Somebody told me lately that you had been in Boston within a month; but I could not believe that you would have gone away without letting me have the pleasure of seeing you. Bartlett is happy, & busy, but he has no more money than he had two years ago. His son is now with him; & they are finishing two portrait busts of rich men. Mrs. Fairchild, whom you will remember, is never done preaching you & your work. Good bye.Faithfully yoursBoyle O'Reilly John Boyle O'Reilly to Walt Whitman, 11 February 1885"
