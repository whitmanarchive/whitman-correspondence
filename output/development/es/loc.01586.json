    "text": "Oct 2Dear boy and ComradeYou say it is a pleasure to you to get my letters—well, boy, it is a real pleasure to me to write to you—I just write off-hand, whatever comes up, and, as I said before, mostly about myself & my own doings. [There have been some] tremendous fires—the one [in] Brooklyn—eight or ten first-class steam engines—Tell Harry on No 11, he would see quite a change in the Fire Dep't. Pete, if you see Pittsburgh either tell him the following, or let him have this letter, & then return it to you. Write how David Stevens is, & write how he is getting along. I have more than I can attend to here. I find myself surrounded by friends, many old ones, some new ones, some young & attractive, & plenty of invitations & amusements. I have received an invitation from a gentleman & wife, friends of mine, at Providence, R. I., and shall go there & spend a few days latter part of October. How about the cold? I hope it is well. Dear Pete, with all my kind friends here & invitations, &c., though I love them all, & gratefully reciprocate their kindness, I finally turn to you, & think of you there. Well, I guess I have written enough for this time. Dear Pete, I will now bid you good bye for the present. Take care of yourself, & God bless you, my loving comrade. I will write again soon. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 2 October [1868]"
