I have rec'd your note, & wish to answer it elaborately soon. At present, I can only say that if you are going into publishing & if you feel like taking hold of my productions, I should cordially open negotiations with you—But the papers are in error in giving the idea that I am writing a book on a new subject—it is only a new & far more perfected edition of Leaves of Grass—which work, though printed, has really never been published at all. I shall be happy to hear any thing from you. My address is at this office. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Abraham Simpson, 20 May 1867"
