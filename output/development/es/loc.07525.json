B. & probably all I have uttered, I have a considerate eye not at all to itself alone, but to its place with all the rest I have uttered, & also to the future & permanency—many sharp readers might not think so, but I have—Don't make much calculation of the complete Vol. It will be I hope a respectable looking piece of typography &c. but nothing to brag of—but it authenticates probably better than any thing yet—there were several errors hitherto—not serious perhaps but errors—all these have of course been corrected, & as I look over the pp. there appears not to be any typographical or any other blemish—(I am quite sure of that with L of G. throughout)—& there will be five or six likenesses from life—& autograph—Then this ensemble idea haunts me till I get it realized in an identity volume—I am a little fearful ab't our dear O'C—eagerly look for word—Matters so so with me—good bowel clearance to-day—word from my friend Linton from Eng[land] to-day—he is well—Shall have some oysters for my dinner ab't 4—made my breakfast of a big roast apple & some Graham bread—the sun is out—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 13 October 1888"
