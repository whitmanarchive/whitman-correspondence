We shall try to publish the poem on Monday, and if we get in shall hope to enclose herewith cheque for the amount. If it doesn't come with this it will be because of my being compelled to go down to Washington as a witness in the Impeachment trial. If by reason of my absence it should be overlooked, pray remind me of it.Very Truly Yours,Whitelaw ReidWalt Whitman, Esq431 Stevens St.StreetCamden N. J.New Jersey Whitelaw Reid to Walt Whitman, 10 July 1876"
