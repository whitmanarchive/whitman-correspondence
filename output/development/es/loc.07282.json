    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,16 Dec 1888The books did not arrive last ev'g to my great disgust. I went in on purpose to inquire for them at express office. I shall no doubt get them tomorrow forenoon, will then write again. I wonder how you are getting on by now? Much better I hope but I dare not count on anything and am very anxious all the time. We are having gloomy weather which does not tend to cheer one, raining all day and looks as though it might rain for a week—the roads were hard and were getting nice and smooth now they will be in a devil of a mess again. Willy Gurd is to be home early in the week—I shall try and hurry up the meter patents so as to get East as soon as possible. But it seems difficult to get on, every step takes such a time—however the end must come at lastI wish I could hear from O.C. I imagine all sorts of things about him and worry a good deal. My chief interest now is the pat, I trust I shall hear tomorrow morning that you are easierAlways your friendR M BuckeP.S.I have the \"Boston Literary World\" of 8th inst. Horace had it sent to me. Not a bad little review at all of \"November Boughs\" Do you know who did it? He is a good friend and has considerable insight into matters—is evidently holding himself in in the little col. and half article—RMBSee notes Dec 18, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 16 December 1888"
