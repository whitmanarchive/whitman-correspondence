I have a pamphlet which goes back eight generations to the first Whitman that came from England to America.Mr Farnam of New Haven is now getting up a more general and complete oneI had an Uncle John (a ) who lived in New York. (Levi and Elinor) who lived in Massachusetts, and Josiah, who died in Michigan over 90 years old, leaving several sons.When I hear of one bearing the name it is always gratifying to me to know which branch they descended from.Yours trulyH.
