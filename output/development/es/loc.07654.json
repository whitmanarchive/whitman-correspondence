I have got a few lines from Jeff (in St Louis)—I am now sitting in the big chair—Spend most of the day here—had my dinner a little ago—now 5½—cool & clear & pleasant to-day—I am quite comfortable—Hope this will find you feeling well—Rain'd like fury nearly all yesterday—Mrs. D[avis] intended going yesterday—I was favorable to her going—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman, [13(?) August 1888]"
