    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,1 Nov 1888Another month commenced and am greatly in hopes we are to have some fine weather to make up for the nearly 40 days rain we have had. At all events the month has opened well. A lovely bright, hazy, warm, fresh autumn morning. I got yesterday the bundle of papers including \"Critic\" and was much interested in the review of Crawford's \"Kalevala.\" Also in the \"Tribune\" article on what New York is doing in the way of provision for her insane—this is a live issue with us here at present and I forwarded the article with a letter to Honble A.S. Hardy (Provincial Secretary) recommending that we do something of the same sort. In the afternoon came McKay's \"November Boughs\"—for which many thanks, I like it well and if I had not seen the other should have thought it quite perfect, as it is I like your \"N.B.\" with the limp cover best. Horace tells me that Musgrove is to leave on Sunday or Monday morning. I have written Ed. Wilkins and will have him leave here by 11.40 train Sunday morning. He will reach Philadelphia about 8 a.m. Monday. I shall give him full directions to your house and letters to you and to Mrs Davis. Still no word from Wm Gurd—looks as if he has had an attack of agraphia—inability to write—confound the fellow he promised to let me know every few days how he was getting on and has only written one letter in 2½ weeks. All well here had a big crowd of young folk at the house last evening (All-Hallow-E'en) telling fortunes, dancing &c &c great funAffectionatelyR M BuckeSee notes Nov. 3, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 1 November 1888"
