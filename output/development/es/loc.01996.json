    "text": "SyracuseJan 24th 1869Walt WhitmanDear FriendI recdreceived your letter dated at Brooklyn two weeks ago today & I assure you it gave me great pleasure to hear from you and to hear that yourself & Mother were well how I pity your poor Crippled Brother.I would have liked to have visited you in New York if I had know it soon enough But I think I shall see you some other time and then we will have a jolly visit together.I do not know what to say about our Baby Walt, but he is like most other Babys[babies] of his age (10 months) he is full of fun & is rather quick tempered or as I call it he is ugly. If you would like to have it I will send you his Photograph some time this winter, then you can judge for yourself we have not had much very cold weather here this winder; and today it is very Pleasant.Father & Mother & My Wife send Love to my kind Friend, & you know you have a good share of mine.I am still at work at the same Business Pianos & Melodeons & do not know but I always shall be.Write soon as you can.Yours with LoveB.H. WilsonB.H. Wilson Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 24 January 1869"
