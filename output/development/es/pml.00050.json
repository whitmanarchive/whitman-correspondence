    "text": "Nov: 10th—Down at the StaffordsKirkwood (Glendale)I still keep quite well considering—have been down here the past week—every thing much the same as of old with our friends the S[tafford]s—Mr and Mrs S, and all their sons and daughters—Harry is down at Atlantic City, telegraph operator at a RR station but is going to Camden, same position—A fine week down here for me—the finest sort of mellow sunny autumn weather—the old woods fine & I in it for hours every day (sometimes I think it as good in its way as the Creek)—I go about nearly the same, my lameness no better (occasionally pretty bad, worse) but my feelings of comfort & strength in general better than former years—often decidedly better—13th Saturday—Still here—We drove over yesterday (Mrs S and I) to the old place at Timber Creek & down by the pond—I thought it beautiful as ever along the creek and banks—This month Scribner has a long criticism by E C Stedman on L of G & author, quite funny—\"I would & I would not\" style, with a bad portrait—Dr. B[ucke] is furious—Burroughs thinks it well enough & will do good—probably the truth between the two—I see in the papers allusions to \"the Gilchrist Thomas process\" & its adoption in some of the great works & foundries—So I think it must be a permanent triumph—I congratulate you all & of course Percy especially (for all I dont know him)—Sunday 14thRather cold, the feeling of snow, but dry & pleasant in a way—I sell some of my books occasionally—have quite a supply left—of late have had more American purchasers than foreigners—(different from previous experience)—Rec'd your letter of two months since in Canada—it was very welcome—I wrote a postal card from here to Herbert, over a month ago—Did he get it? Is the address on this right? Do you see any thing of my friend Josiah Child? A gentleman named Ingram (in the Engineer's office, London General Post Office) has written to me twice in the interest of publishing a Vol: of my prose writings in London—He seems to be a nice sort of man (is the author of an edition of Poe in London)—I think I shall give him your address & ask to call on you.Love to you all—where is Beatrice, & how?Walt WhitmanNov 16—I return home to Camden to-day—Every thing as usual—I am well—fine November weather, crisp & sunny—WW Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 10–16 November [1880]"
