It is falling soft and steady as I write here at my desk in my office and from time to time look up and out at the windows to realise & enjoy it. How good it is after heat and dust! how lovely and soothing!\"The Poem of Earth—the voice of the rain\"Giving back life—making it pure & beautiful\"Returning with love.\"Well, I have your good letter of 14th enclosing Rhys' and M. J. Cummings (whoever he (or she?) may be—(melancholy events) the seems to have had a bad time.Yes, I got the \"Woodberry Piece\" all right. These foolish, would be visions, he's & hars will one day come to an end—in the mean time I do not know but they do more good than harm—keep things stived up (Mr Goethe's Faust God says the Devil is a good servant of his—that he (Satan) keeps man stived up while without such prodding man would go, and stay, asleep).— Real glad to hear that you are likely soon to write the O'C preface.Dr Gobustan (I am sorry to say) has never turned up in these parts—perhaps he may yet—hope so—want to see him.Mr & Mrs Mysan are still here—they will go I believe tomorrow—we all like them well and have enjoyed their visit with us.The meter is jogging along slowly—we are getting the shop fitted up—there is a lot to do yet before we have a business established—but we still have confidence and we shall put the thing right thoughYour friendR. M. Bucke R. M. Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 August 1890"
