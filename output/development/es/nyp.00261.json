    "text": "Attorney General's Office,, Washington. Tuesday, March 12, 1867.Dearest mother,I rec'd Jeff's letter on Monday—I am sorry to hear you suffer so much with the rheumatism, & it is so bad in the wrist—Jeff thinks it is because you wash & do the rough work, & expose yourself too much—Mother, I would like if you would get some woman to come every week, or every other week, for a day, & do the washing, &c.—As to the little girls, Jeff says they will be with you, & bother you sometimes too much—When one is old, one is easily tired and annoyed—& I have long been sorry you can't have more quiet to yourself & rest.Every thing goes the same as usual with me—The young man that had bleeding at the lungs seemed to be getting along pretty well, till Saturday & Sunday last, when he had a return of the sweating spells—they weaken him very much—I was down there Sunday—He has been very dissipated though only 24 years old—I believe I told you he is an only son.We had a warm & clear day here yesterday—after the usual long spell of rainy & dark weather—Washington is nothing but mud—I took tea at O'Connors last Sunday night—they are all well as usual—have got to move, the end of this month—they have found no place yet—Ashton, the Assistant Attorney Gen'l, has gone on to Philadelphia with wife & child, to spend three or four days—I like my new boarding place very well, take it altogether—Mother, I am writing this at my table, by the big window I have mentioned several times in former letters—it is very pleasant indeed—the river looks so fine, & the banks & hills in the distance—I can sit sometimes & look out for a long time—It is mighty lucky for me I fell in with such a good situation—Mother, if it was only so where I could come home oftener, & see you & all—I have not thought any thing decided of the visit I spoke of—I will send you word in good time, if I should come—I should rather stop home, this time, if I come, as I should only be for a few days, not more than a week—I can sleep in the room George did—or any how. O, I must tell you I am getting a new coat—sack-coat, dark blue—I have pants of the same—& shall have to get a new vest—when I shall come out quite spruce—I had 6 shirts made last July, & they are good yet—So much for the clothing department. Jeff don't say whether you got my last Tuesday's letter, (March 5,) with the envelopes, &c.—but I suppose of course you did—Yesterday was such a fine day, I went off about 1 o'clock & had quite a jaunt—went to Georgetown, &c. & walked so, I got very tired, when I arrived home—We don't have dinner till 5 o'clock—but I always take a good lunch in my pocket—the table is furnished with plenty, & good—Mother, I think about you a great deal—I think, what if mother is sick & bothered, & every thing—& I feel as if I should fly—I go evenings up to the office frequently—I have got me a splendid astral-lamp, to burn gas by a tube, & it works to admiration, (all at the expense of the office)—& there I can sit, & read &c. as nice as you please—then I am getting many books for the Library (our office Library) that I have long wanted to read at my leisure—& can get any book I want, in reason—so you see it is a great privilege I have here. Love to dear sister Mat, & little ones, & all. Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 12 March 1867"
