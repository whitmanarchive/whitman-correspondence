    "text": "Camp 51st Regt. N.Y.V.V.Near Petersburg VaJanuary 21st, 1865Walt WhitmanBrooklyn N.Y.Friend WhitmanIt has been a long time since I have seen or heard from you, and I suppose that you have nearly forgotten me, but if you will think back you will remember a man by my name, whom you met in Carver Hospital Washington D. C. where we met then the first time. I never expected to be able to write you a line in the year 1865, but I have been spared for some other purpose I suppose. And now you will please accept my thanks for all the favors that you have shown me while lying then unable to help myself.Lieut. Babcock has this morning recd a letter from Lieut. Caldwell. Caldwell and all the rest of our officers are in Danville Military Prison Va, he mentions Maj Wright Capt. Whitman Pooley Sims Ackerson Waldron Carberry Hoyme Groenemeyer Loughson Whitbeck & Murden, they are all doing well, & all they ask for is for something to eat, Hard Bread and Pork, or anything that can be sent them, and as it is impossible for us to get them anything how I hope some of you good people at home will try and do something for them. Lieut Babcock has shown me a memorial of the Old 51st and if you could possiblysend me a few copies I would be very much obliged to you for your trouble. Once more allow me to thank you for your kindness toward me while in Hospital.Hoping to hear from you soon I remainVery Respectfully Yours &c.Lieut A. Smith51st Regt N.Y.V.V.1st Brig 2.d Division9th A.C.P.S.Please send a paper occasionally And obligeA. Smith Aaron Smith to Walt Whitman, 21 January 1865"
