    "text": "1 Torriano Gd.March 11,/76I have had such joy this morning, my Darling—Poems of yours given in the \"Daily News\" sublime Poems (one of them reaching dizzy heights) filling my soul with strong delight. These prefaced by a few words timid enough yet kindly in tone, & better than nothing.—The days the weeks are slipping by my Beloved, bearing me swiftly surely to you—before the beauty of the year begins to fade we shall come. The young folk too are full of bright anticipation & eagerness now, I am thankful to say; and Percy getting on with I trust such near & definite prospect of his happiness that he will be able to pull along cheerily towards it after we are gone in spite of loneliness.I expect Darling we must go to some little town or village ten or twenty miles short of Philadelphia till the tremendous influx of visitors to the Centennial has ceased, else we shall not be able to find a corner there.—By the bye I feel a little sulky at your always taking a fling at the poor Piano. I see I have got to try & show you it too is capable of waking deep chords in the human soul when it is the vehicle of a great Master's thought & emotions—if only my poor fingers prove equal to the task! All my heart shall go into them—Take from my picture a long long look of tender love and joy and faith, deathless ever young, ever growing, ever learning aspiring love, tender cherishing, domestic love. Oh may I be full of sweet comfort for my Beloved's Soul and Body through life, through and after death. Anne Gilchrist.from Mrs. Gilchrist March 11 '76 Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 11 March 1876"
