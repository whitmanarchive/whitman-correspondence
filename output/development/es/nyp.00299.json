    "text": "Brooklyn,107 North Portland av.July 14.Dear friend,There is nothing special to write about, yet I will send you a line. I wrote to Nelly between two & three weeks ago—with a line to you and Charles Eldridge—which I suppose came all right at the time. I have been having a comfortable time, absolutely doing nothing, sleeping a good deal, eating & drinking what suits me, and going out a few hours a day, a good part of the time on the water. Mother has had an attack of illness, somewhat severe, the last few days—& I have been sort of nurse & doctor—(as none of my sisters are home at present)—result is that Mother is very much better this morning—John Burroughs has called on me—looking well.I must tell you that the Westminster for July has for the 2d article of the number a long article of 33 or 4 pages, headed \"The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman\" and capped with the names of the three last issued books—rather quiet in tone, but essentially very favorable & appreciative—undertakes to define the character of democratic art & poetic literature, as discriminated from aristocratic—quotes freely from all my books—will please you, I think.Wednesday's brush in N. Y. you have seen in the papers—in five sixths of the city, it was curiously almost unfelt, every thing went on the same—30 or 40 killed and a hundred wounded—yet it all falls very languidly on our people—we have supped full of horror of late years—the Policemen looked & behaved splendidly—I have been looking on them & been with them much, & am refreshed by their presence—it is something new—in some respects they afford the most encouraging sign I have got—brown, bearded, worn, resolute, American-looking men, dusty & sweaty—looked like veterans—the stock here even in these cities is in the main magnificent—the heads either shysters, villains or impotents—Love to Nelly, Charles Eldridge & Jeannie—Walt Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 14 July [1871]"
