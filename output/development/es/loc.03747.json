I thank you for your love and kindness. Mr. Traubel has read my letter to you, I presume. My essay on you and my translation of \"D. V.\" most surely have not run out in the Sand! Fare ye well, dear old Walt. If we never saw each other in \"the land of living we shall see each other in the \"land of ghosts!\"Truly yoursRudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 8 July 1889"
