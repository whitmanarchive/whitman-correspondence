    "text": "Burlington, VTOcto 271888Walt.Somehow I was always under the impression that the picture we have had so long was Jessie's which occassioned the demand for a photo of Manhatta. The picture of Jessie which you propose to send us, will compose the twain, and we shall not need one of Manhatta: I like that name! and my enthusiasm was rekindled in a very lively degree by the presence of these two blooming girls greeting me so warmly, calling me \"Uncle Charlie\" — I had just returned from a second visit to the Adirondacks the day after they arrived. Han was sick — very sick. I doubt that she will ever be hale and strong, or normal again. She thinks that, if she could make you a visit, and have a good long rest, she would be restored. You could suggest to her that, if at any time she would like to make you a visit, you would be prepared to recieve her: If, for the time, you could furnish a couple of rooms. It may be necessary. I had a talk with Dr Lund lately: he thought it would be beneficial to write to her. Continue the Phila Press: visit the Progress. dont need it. George sent word that she should come, at any time, and remain with him as long as she desired.Charlie. Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 27 October [1888]"
