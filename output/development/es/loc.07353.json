    "text": "London, Ont.,6 July 1890Your card of 2nd came to hand yesterday morning. Kennedy was here and I showed it to him. He left by 11.30 a.m. train for the west. I took him to the station and saw him off. He could only stay with me from Wednesday evening to Saturday morning—a short visit but I was glad to have him—would have been more glad if he could have stayed longer. We had some good talks and altogether a real good time. I wish you could get the little \"annex\" out at once—I want much to see it but suppose it cannot be issued untill Lippencott gets the poems printed that he has.It is sunny, warm (not hot) and pleasant here. The place tooks well and all is going quietly and well with us.My brother Eustace (who you will remember)—we call him Duke—arrived here at noon today from Ottawa we have spent a few pleasant hours together this afternoonLove to you—So long!RM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 July 1890"
