My wishes are that this may find you enjoying good health and plenty of kind friends to associate with.I have not been over to Armory Square Hospital since leaveing itâ€”. But have been expecting to call there and also to see you The orders here are very strict no one is allowed out side of Camp without a pass and the passes are scarse[scarce]I shall manage to see you before I leave for the front if possible We are to get our horses in a day or so, and then be off to joine[join] our RegimentsThe News are dull concerning the movements of the Army but for all that we expect to hear of a hard fought Battle before long. I think that we will be sent out as reenforcements[reinforcements] so much the betterNow Uncle I hope you will not believe that I had or have forgoten[forgotten] you. I will write again when at the front & perhaps have something more worth writing about. I will close by expecting to have a better opportunity of writing some thing else when you hear from me again My health is good at presentbelieve me ever your friendRuben Farwell Reuben Farwell to Walt Whitman, 30 April 1864"
