I reserve to myself a more leisure time for careful reading of your present. I enclose my address at Yale University delivered before the Alumni & whole College. As but 15 minutes were allowed, I have barely been able to state my views without discussion. So much the better perhaps—as our national failing is more talk than thought.I have but the moment to return you my thanks—I wish you all happiness. TrulyC. M. ClayWalt Whitman Esq.Camden:N.
