W'd that be better? (I leave mainly to y'r taste & judgment)—if you have anything better as strong backs (stitching &c) as can consistently be made—uncut & untrimm'd like this sample (I like this sample even as it is pretty well)—☞ I will send you the label to put on the backs—I am now having them printed—(will also have the 550 copies in handsome costlier stiff bindings afterwards.)Walt Whitman328 Mickle St Camden Walt Whitman to Frederick Oldach, [27 November 1888]"
