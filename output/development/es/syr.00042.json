    "text": "[London, Ont.,]27 March [188]9Yours of Saturday and Sunday just to hand. I am much pleased to hear you speak so definitely about the new book. The big book ought to have been $10. instead of $6. that would have left margin enough for every thing and it is my belief that it would have sold about as freely at the larger price as the smaller. $5. for the new book is not too much but it is out of all proportion to $6. for the Complete works. Why not date the little book on title page \"30 May 1889\" or better date it in M.S. along with autograph?\"Walt Whitman31 May 1889\"?That would be a splendid souvenir. I am rejoiced to hear that Ed. has resumed the semi massageI do not wonder that McKay \"declines your proposition\" the price of the book once established cannot well be changed and if McK paid $3.33 and $1.28 for binding = $4.61 he would have too little profit.Nothing new here, all heartyLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 March 1889"
