    "text": "Your note of Oct 8, enclosing Dr Russell's of 4th to you, is just rec'd. Yours with $5, some weeks ago, came safely. The generosity of Dr. Russell, Mrs. Curtis, and the other friends, I will briefly say, tells daily & nightly & shall tell to the best of my power, upon my dear boys here, in hospital. I do not miss one day or night. (I guess we, I & the wounded &c, were made for each other.) I have written to Dr Russell, to Mrs Curtis & to Miss Stevenson. Do you want to print a little 30 or 50ct book about the scenes, war, camp, hospitals &c (especially the &c.) I shall probably remain here, in this thing. I am very happy. I never was so beloved. I am running over with health, fat, red & sunburnt in face &c. I tell thee I am just the one to go [to] our sick boys. Good by, my friend. Walt Whitman to James Redpath, 12 October 1863"
