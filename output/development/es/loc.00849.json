    "text": "TroyMarch 7th 65Your last letter from Washington in the paper lying on my lap—Your book in the hands of my friend Lucy who sits there by the window reading it in the morning sunshine. She looks up suddenly and says \"I think this is the soul I am waiting for, is Walt Whitman married?\" I cannot answer the question, but will you?—I am not interested to know if you are married, but I would like to look in your face. How many years did you live ere you could look into the depths of all hearts. Through what experiences did you learn that lore? Remember, if ever the opportunity comes I will look in your face. It should say all that is in your book and something more. I want that something more.Celia M. Burr(Care of Madame Willard)Troy N.Y.) Celia M. Burr to Walt Whitman, 7 March 1865"
