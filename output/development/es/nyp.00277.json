    "text": "Williamâ€”bring in, in your letter to Mr. Rossetti. I met Mr. Whitman a few evenings since. He has received your letter of December 16th. He duly received the previous ones also, making three letters from you. He is entirely satisfied with your action, & with Mr. Hotten's, in regard to the London selection & reprint, and seems pleased with the condition into which that enterprise has been shaped. He spoke with deep appreciation of you & your letters. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, [January 1868]"
