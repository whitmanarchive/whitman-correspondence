    "text": "Independence IowaFeb 7th 1872Dear Mrs. Whitman,I have thought of you many many times since last fall. How well I would like to run up your stairs, rap at your door, and hear your \"come in\" and \"How-do-you-do, Grace\". To find you well, and pleasantly pass an evening with you, as coisily[cozily] as we used to, you sitting in your rocking-chair I in mine, talking upon general spies, or a little harmless gossip. But instead of that, the letter-man, will ring, this bit of a letter will be brought up, and good Mrs. Whitman will look it over, wondering who it is from, open to see and read these few sentences, I have penned which will be stale and cold, traveling so far. How much better I could say it all, and more too if I was sitting opposite to you, looking right into your eyes.I fully appreciate the privileges of the pen, but it is so very slow.Now How do you do? Mrs. Whitman, are you happy this winter, and are you and Eddie alone? Father wrote that the family in your house had moved; perhaps you have someone else in, if not you must be lonesome. Do you go out much and has it been very cold.Oh it has been so very cold here. People say here, it has not been so cold, or as much sleighing for many years. We have had good sleighing for nine weeks, and the thermometer as low as twenty two deg.degrees below zero. The wind is fearful. Sometimes when I ride, I am inclined to drop into the bottom of the sleigh, and have whoever is driving sit on alone, for fear I shall blow away, but in spite of the cold and wind, they tell me I am growing fleshy. I am feeling quite well, most of the time. Sister is quite pleasantly situated, a short distance from the Main St.Street so that we are quite retired. A large house with abundance of rooms. The people we have met, seem friendly and agreeable, most of them are Eastern people that have been here but a few years. We have not been out any evenings, there is always something to prevent. They have their village Sociable, or Hop every week, and each church has its social meeting each week at private houses. and by what I hear, I should think them quite enjoyable.I miss very much Lectures, Concerts &c, but have an abundance of good reading, and as I cannot have other music, furnish my own, which passes away many an hour pleasantly.I notice many things which strikes me as odd or funny, and I often repeat it, or act it out for the benefit of the rest and we have many a good hearty laugh. I quite enjoy the novelty of the change.CLC#2833There are seven churches in town. Two large, three story brick schoolhouses, carefully graded. Many stores, with good assortment of goods Dry goods a little dearer than in Brooklyn, but Provision much cheaper, especially meat, fowls, butter, eggs flour & meal. Chickens Porter-house steak, eight and ten cents per lb.pound Sugar about two cents more per lb.pound Tea & Coffee the same. Coal (hard coal) $16. per. ton. We have burned three tons already in the pitting-room stove, we burn wood in the kitchen & parlor.I often think of Father and Mother fearing something may happen to them for I know Mother has more than she ought to do, but I hope they may enjoy continual good health, and I soon shall be home again and relieve Mother a bit, and tease Father, I am afraid they will dry up from very quietness, I ought to be on hand to stir them up. Thursday is the most eventful day of the week, for then I receive my letters from home. and only those know, who are separated from their dearest friends, how precious a letter is from them. When I hear that they are well, I feel quite satisfied for another week, and all the other bits of this and that about home, neighbors and friends, give many pleasant thoughts.I never cared so much for letters as now, they are doubly welcome, scarcely a day passes but what I receive one or more and papers. Only last saturday[Saturday] I received, After All, Not So Greater The American Institute Poem, for which I am very much obliged indeed. I suppose you sent it. You are very kind to think of me. I have read it through, I missed much of it the day it was delivered. May I expect an answer Mrs. Whitman. with very much love to you,I remain Yours sincerelyGrace B. Haight. Grace B. Haight to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 7 February 1872"
