    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,28 Oct 1888All very quiet, rainy weather still continued though varied by an occasional fine day. Nothing more from W. Gurd but I expect each mail to get a letter which will fix the time of my departure for the East (always supposing I get leave of absence). No word has reached from O'Connor since the little scrap I sent you some days since, I feel very uneasy about him and wish I could run down to Washington to see him while I am East but I fear that will be impossible, my time will be short and there will be a great deal to do. Your last letter to me was written a week ago today I hope one will cross this if so I will write again at once. In any case will write as soon as I hear from W. Gurd to tell you what the prospects are in re going East.I have been wondering lately how it came that so much of the mythology of the old Greeks, especially the Herakleian-Zodiacal myths came from Semitic-Chaldean sources? Could the Greeks have mixed with a Semitic people while in western Asia, before the Homeric age? And was this blending of the two high races one cause (hybridization is the great secret of advance in the whole organic world) of the extraordinary elevation of the Periclean Greeks?Your friendR M BuckeSee notes Oct. 30 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 October 1888"
