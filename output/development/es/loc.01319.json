    "text": "14 Milborne Grove, BromptonLondon, England.Feb. 1, 68My dear friend,I have but a moment in which to write to you, if I save the mail. My object is to ask you, in behalf of Hotten, whether it is consistent with your will that the selection from your works made by Rossetti shall be sold in the American market. Hotten has written to me that if so he will give you one shilling on each copy sold in America. He hopes the prefatory essay may attract purchasers there. I have read it, and it is excellent. The volume will be out next week; it is very neatly done, and quite as large as your last edition (American). Hotten writes that when expenses are paid, you will have a percentage on each copy sold here. I have assumed to be your financial agent here. I hope you will answer about the sale in America by return. Rossetti is much pleased by your letters to him. If you see O'Connor please thank him for sending me The Ghost and The Carpenter—which we (wife and I) think extremely interesting, and dramatic. You will see in the February Fortnightly I have (in reviewing Swinburne's \"Blake\") had something more to say of your work—which is to me the more I read it (as I do daily) the Genesis of an American Bible.Faithfully yours,M. D. ConwayP.S. I will watch for reviews when your book appears, & send you any that are valuable. Moncure D. Conway to Walt Whitman, 1 February 1868"
