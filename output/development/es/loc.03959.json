    "text": "CamdenMonday Evn'gJuly 23 '88Well I sent you yesterday a letter enclosing others—& here is one now from Herbert, just rec'd—as I promised—he does not allude to his visit to America, but there may be something in it——I feel better—am working a little at my booklet yesterday and to-day—my head feels easier, but the weakness especially in getting about & in my knee power is fearful—Hope you & George and Ed & Deb & Jo & the young one are jolly & sitting up—Walt WhitmanI don't want this letter of Herbert's returned—12 Well Road,Hampstead,London, England.July 8th1888My dear Walt;I have followed your illness with breathless concern—that is, what I could learn of it from the short and alarming dispatches in the \"Daily News.\" I was so rejoiced to see substantive proof of your part recovery in the firmly written post cards to Mrs. Costelloe.We both wanted to telegraph when you were so ill only we didn't know who to telegraph to, as Mr. Smith was just leaving Phila.I have just received a letter from Ernest Rhys who speaks of having been back to England 2 weeks. Mrs. Costelloe told me that he told Count Stenbock that he (Ernest R) had made & lost a fortune in the States.It is a cold rainy summer with us—so cold that we feel to want a fire.Mrs. William Rossetti is far from well & is away at Ventnor recruiting.Saturday Grace & I gave quite a large party—58 guests—from 8.30 to 12 o.c. in the evening. Everyone seemed to enjoy it & the evening passed off quite brilliantly.Mrs. Costelloe is sitting 3 days a week to me —how affectionately and nicely she talks of you.I think that I shall paint a pretty picture from her.You forwarded a long & interesting letter from S. Morse which I have duly answered: he wrote in excellent spirit—affairs seem to be going well with him.With hearty greetings & remembrances to Mrs. Davis,Herbert H. GilchristI am just starting for a sitting with Mrs. CostelloeHenry Holmes violinist & composer is on the point of writing to buy books from you. Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 23 July 1888"
