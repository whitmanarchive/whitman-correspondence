    "text": "1015 O St. N. W.Jan. 28. 1889Monday A. M.Dear Walt,For many days I have tried to write you, but the pressure is so great that I can't get the moment to sit down, for as yet I am the only nurse, & my duties are constant, much of the time. If things get worse I shall have to have a man to help me lift & nurse William. This morning after your card came he asked me to write & tell you how very ill he is. The attack he had on the 18th was less severe than the one a year ago on the 16th of Jan. but he is so much worse in all other ways, & the lower limbs so useless that all is harder for him. He feels discouraged for the first tim, & says the outlook is very gloomy. His constant annoyance from the bladder trouble now is worse than all else, & so far the Doctors have not reached it at all.If Dr. Bucke comes in soon can he not, will he not, be able to run over & call on us? I am sure he could advise me how to nurse & care for William in the best hospital manner, —as yet he has not at all come to the idea that any one but me is needed, — & I don't mean to suggest it till I have come to the point where I must, & can't do for him, but he is very helpless & very heavy.I try to keep my courage up, & not to look ahead more than I must.William sends love, & is always glad to hear. He can read but not write.With all best wishes, & with love—Nelly O'Connor.At this moment he is dressed & sitting up reading, but feeling very quiet, & very silent.E. M. O'C. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 28 January 1889"
