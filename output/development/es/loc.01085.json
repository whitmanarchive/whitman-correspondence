I went back to the beginning, I have read and reread carefully, I do not understand you all in all fully, but I recognize the manliness of you, the power you possess, the strength of mind and limb—and, meter of conventional ideas in the lines and feet of conventional poetry as I am. I feel how weak and pitiful physically and mentally I must look to the better, the stronger part of me—my dear sir, I cannot analyze my feelings, had any one told me that my blood would leap, my soul cry out at the poems of a man, as blood and soul and heart spring at some glorious aspect of nature, I should have laughed at him—But I feel while reading you (not your book, but you) as though I were let loose in some grand rugged place where I had never thought to be, and all around teeming with pre Adamite strangeness and majesty—This is just you and myself. I cannot help writing you. I do not know if you will read anything I say, whether my name is a familiar or unfamiliar one to you,—but at least I am and must be hereafter one who \"loves you secretly\" in his heart, and openly to the world—At least it must be something to you to have a man say that you have done him good, physically and spiritually good. It cannot be so much a matter of indifference to you that in all gratitude I offer my tender thanks and changed belief and admiration. I have taken \"from your lips\" the kiss, and with all my heart and soul return it to you. Believe that I shall study you more and more, and if ever the day comes that I may give you the hearty and true hand grasp, and look in your eyes and in your face, even though my own tongue is silent I think you will understand my soul and that I am faithfully your friendJames Berry BenselToWalt WhitmanCamden N.J.New Jersey James Berry Bensel to Walt Whitman, 3 April 1880"
