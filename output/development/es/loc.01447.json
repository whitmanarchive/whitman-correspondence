    "text": "15. SUNDERLAND STREET.Sunderland,8 Sept 1874Dear Sir,I was right glad to hear of you again through the medium of the newspaper, you so kindly sent me, I have been thinking of writing you a few lines these months past, only I was afraid your illness would prevent you form[from] feeling any interest in one so far away as me, and I also felt so deeply for you that I did not like to disturb the repose you seemed to need from your Duty. the enclosed papers will show you the use I have made of the paper, so that other English friends of yours should also learn the good news from Camden. Hope these few Chapters upon you and your work may make your work and you more known to our working Classes the periodical in which they were published as principally its main subscribers amongst them. the Writer of them is a fellow of deep sympathy and has contributed from time to time some fine feeling and Sympathetic articles to its pages. the first one I noted was on W.Blake our Poet Artist of whom Swineburne[Swinburne] has written of so nobly and so well. I post these by letter (and send also two by newspaper Post,) so that I may feel somewhat certain some of them will reach you. I had some hopes of seeing you in our land, and was delighted beyond measure when I saw in our papers our Tennyson had written to invite you to visit him, I also feel glad to be enabled to inform you that W.M. Rossetti's Edition has been all sold. and the 1872 are subscribed too by our English Publisher has also met with a good sale, of course in a way that is not very complimentary to English appreciation of your Work. I.E. by being sold in what is termed the \"remainder sale\" of course my own feeling respecting this is, it gives to people of small means an oppertunity[opportunity] to possess a Book they otherwise would never have, \"so out of evil cometh forth good\" so saith the Old Booklast year I was down at oxford at the time EmersonRalph Waldo Emerson was there, I had no oppertunity[opportunity] to speak to him of you, that as I did not think it wise to open the question at the times when I saw, I would gladly have done so, only I was not quite certain how he felt towards you, so as he did not name you out anytime I was in his company as a listener at Max Muller's, I thought it best to be silent, and while at oxford I wandered through the Marketplace (for I love to mingle with all kinds of my fellow men, but I most especially love country folk, fisher folk, and hard workers amongst our people I dearly love to mingle with and chat in their ways, and to enjoy a kind feeling of sympathy one with the other on these occassions[occasions],) well while I wandered here and there I saw a stout wellbuilt man in a small shop selling paper and when I looked at his wares I saw thereon your Family name, so felt a desire to talk with him. I bought small paper then had small talk and he said the only persons he Knew bearing the name lived at Egham in Surrey and where[were] mostly Market Gardners. and one branch of the family had been Stewards of the Duke of Richmond, and one had emigrated to America some distant relation of his family years ago, but they had never heard any news of them—so when I told him there was such a name in America owned by a family there and one of them was a poet, he thought perhaps it might be possible you where[were] a desendant[descendant] of that distant relative. he was quite a build of man like you, a noble large bodied and large featured man, full of seeming good honest purpose in his nature, and more like a farmer than a humble Stationer, so that he did honour to the Stock, though not exactly in his trade. he was a type of man I like to see, only he seemed rather confined in his ideas of Books.—I sent to him some small notice of you and your work, from Chambers paper, but I never received any reply, so feel afraid your work is not of a kind to suit his tastes. I note also recently your Poem on Lincoln has been read in London at a Liberary[Library] Association, so slowly though I suppose and hope certainly will you become known to us more widely and truly. Well I must conclude this rambling note, with a hearty wish that you will be once again able to do some more work for our race and help on the Life, that our hope is, yet shall be. Ruskin is also working hard too to help on a nobler life, and one not much unlike the one you also long to see. so many souls labouring for one end must someday effect the accomplishment of the \"Golden Days\" so long sung, so long toiled for, prayed for—and fought for!!Yours affectionatelyT Dixon Thomas Dixon to Walt Whitman, 8 September 1874"
