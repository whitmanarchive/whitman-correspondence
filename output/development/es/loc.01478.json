And much, much good has it done me—I remain in health much as usual, of late—Shall come over & spend a couple of hours with you soon. Shall send you a postal day before.Walt WhitmanShall get the tinotype of horse & wagon &c. for you, first opportunity—. Walt Whitman to Thomas Donaldson, 16 September 1886"
