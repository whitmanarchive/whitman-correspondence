Prof: Cope (above) gave a lecture last evn'g in Unitarian Ch. here on the \"Descent of Man\"—(a pretty formidable theme)—they say a good lecture—I came home here at 8—can't find a cutting f'm the London \"Piccadilly\" I desired to enclose—so I put in an old letter f'm Kennedy—Regards & love to you & Mrs: B & all—Walt WhitmanAlys Smith here to-day—Mary's trouble is f'm the eyes— Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 7 December 1889"
