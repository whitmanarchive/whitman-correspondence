    "text": "Kjǿbenharn,d. 4 April 1873Dear Walt Whitman,I have been in these last months as a haunted[hunted] deer and still at present I have in many days not an only leisure–hour, and all this business is not in your American money–making way, though of the most cumbrous and toilsome sort.\"Democratic Vistas\" have they before not appeared in danish translation. The translation into Danish of your prose is a very difficult task, and I dare not confide it to any other than myself. But in the next half year the translation shall appear.I have received to[two] or three american papers from you;— of course you have duly received from me a little selection of norwegian poetry in English translation. If my article on you should appear in any american magazine, I should like to have sent a copy.\"Northamerican[ American] Review\" Fin has had an article on Bj Bjornson by Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen. I wonder that Clemens Petersen who is an infinitely greater talent has got no entrance into this periodical.How is it with poor Clausen? I long to hear news from him and from yourself.YoursRudolf SchmidtSchmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 4 April 1873"
