    "text": "sent p.card March 5, '76Th. DixonThomas Dixon's Greetingexcuse this scrawl I am so anxious to reply I feel quite nervous.15 Sunderland StreetSunderland16 Feb. 1876Dear Sir, & Friend I hasten to reply to your letter of the 2nd which came to hand just last night, and I must confess cheered me for I had been expecting its arrival for some weeks, and was growing somewhat dubious my letter and package had gone astray, but thanks to the powers that be they have reached you all safely, and seemed to have been cheering and welcome to[too]: Well that was indeed glad news to me, for I must confess I suffer to[too] from Bronchial Ashma[Asthma], and it makes me somewhat doleful at times, so that I often feel in dread when I write letters I write them hopeful to[too]: Well it was very gratifying to learn and see you where[were] still able to write a little, and work also a little—glad and welcome news that I could be a subscriber direct to you: our Ruskin here publishes his own Books, and how he does I will let you know bye[by] and bye[by]—I am anxious to reply to day so cannot inform you now. neither can I give you the copies from Dear Canon Kingsley's Lectures that I hope will be cheer you to read some day. I mean to send them. it is hopeful and full of the spirit of your own poems which from a parson and Chaplain to a Queen was good news to read to a Democrat. I loved the man. I loved his works. I honoured him for what he had attempted to do for the people, years ago, when Democracy was not so respectable. I mean to send you his portrait. he was a fine noble healthy looking man, fine read and Whiteflesh, like a Cultured farmer or Fisherman and had a large big hand and heart and stood somewhat your hight[height]. as near as I can guess fine blue gray Eyes. I met him 3 years ago. we had often promised to me[meet], but alas never did so but that once: then only for an hour or two. Yet how full of sublime love and true fellowship the time passed.his Wife his[is] now busy writing a sketch of his life, and I must try to send you one. I know you will love the man—I enclose you a P.O.O. for $3.00 send me the set of your works—and one copy of the two Rivulets (I want it to give to the writer of the letter I sent you on your Essay on Burns) I note you the Editions I have of your Works. I felt a regret I lost one. Yet after all I ought not for from it we got the first English Edition by W.W.—Leaves of Grass 1860, 1861 are have 3 copies if not four in our neighbourhood.The press Copy of Leaves of Grass 1867 that was used by Rossetti for his Edition of your Poems. his copy London 1868.—Leaves of Grass Washington 1872. Burrough's. Poet & person—I mean to let you know how many copies of the 1872 I have sold and given to folks I thought would like your Poems. that his[is] the way I contribute to my religion, which is the Books I love and like, so I sell them, or I give them away. So E. Poe's works have grown and spread here and in the Circle I move in. so too Brete[Bret] Harte's work. and last Joaquin Millers[Miller's] is growing here. I speak of you, and get folks to read your Works, then to buy them, then to love and honour you. I wish your people in America would cease to be so doleful about you, and your Works let them who love you cherish, and aid the sale of this Edition and all other Editions then let the world, the newspaper, the other Authors and great men go their way, and do their work as best the[they] may. let us do ours but no repining If we love M. Antoninus, Epitectus[Epictetus] Socrates, Christ, and you, and the Band of fellows like you, let us serve you and help you all we can in silent noble faithfulness. I love silent worship aid and help. that is who I love Carlyle. for years he made no sign, but waited and the Sun shone at last. let us all be content to wait. let us do our very best who are believers to aid and help our singers. but in silence I feel glad Joaquin Miller calls to see you. I love the man. I love a deal he has written, especially is[his] life amongst the Modocs. theres[there's] a little band here loves him too his ride to Brazos struck a fire that has grown to a white heat with us all. I copied a lot of his account of the Indians and their treatment and the pollution of the Rivers and sent it to Ruskin—he was deeply interested with it and said he had no idea that the pollution of your beautiful stream had also taken placehe intends to make use of my tracts some day. Shake hands with Miller for me. tell I yearn to see him—and to own his portrait. tell him I have his Wife's noble defence of him. that I have read it often to friends here. I hope some day I may see you all and shake your hands and talk a little too. I was glad to learn Tennyson has still corresponded with you, and that he writes you so Kindly too. I love him for the noble poems he has written and for his noble heart, for years ago he sent me many kind letters of deep sympathy and friendships when I first commenced to do work for my fellow workman. Conway too is a fine noble fellow. the others I dont know but I feel glad to see despite the Oraters against you. the power you possess is telling. go on in the spirit, and in the spirit may we help youNo 2I see them now while I write this. I look into thine eyes. I grasp thy hand. thou grasps it hard. thou looks upon me with a smile. I hear thee say: \"All is peace now young man the storm is indeed past I live once again in the Souls and memories of those Hero's[Heroes] and all is Well!\" Oh could I tell thee my feeling when I read that which thou tells me of \"Lincoln\"—I loved the man, though I never knew him. Ruskin once wrote me a Note (when I told him what a noble soul he was) \"how is it, this was never Know[known] until now?\" that was at his Death. I soon let him know from printed matter & had by me how it was I loved the man. he wrote and thanked me, and then said he was indeed glad to know your people had been blessed with such a man, and he then deeply regretted his sad end for your peoples[people's] sake. —So, you see my friend, your Captain is also Known and his memory made dear in places thou dreamed not of: so I tell thee this to cheer thee: and to show thee though silent, thou livest still warm in my heart and in all the hearts of our little land: one letter I send thee, which I hope will please thee: for it is written by one I love dear.I enclose thee is[his] portrait, so that thou may know him also. I send also some M.S.S. that I have had copied from Canon Kingsley's works especially for you by another of the circle. it seemed strange the very passages I noted to be done was selected by you to[too] for your \"two Rivulets\" I send it altogether simply because I did not care to disjoint: also it seemed that there is a deep bond of sympathy between us—when we both should unknown to each other have both selected the same passage. I got a nice poem from W.J. Linton: I felt sorry it did not give me his address—I had it reprinted in one of our local papers it seems to have made an impression on some of our people: I would like to have sent to him a copy of the paper had I [is][his] address: I also would like to introduce to him a young friend of mine that is in New York: the son of a Quaker of Manchester: a fine noble fellow who died very suddenly to our sad loss for he was a noble soul, full of good broad liberal ideas with the power to give expression to them: a fighter in all good causes. his son seems a noble fellow—and I would so like him to know a man like Linton or any such soul. I feel I would like to make my young friend Know to some good souls for I think there is stuff in him. so if you can aid me in my wish it will help to knit the firmer our bonds of unity and love, and he may someday go and see you, and then our love will still be dearer for I advised him to go to America, so that I feel deeply interested in him & his welfare—He seems a fine lad to me and I could rejoice exceedingly if he should visit you, for I yearn to hear what either you or any soul like you, would think of him. I often think I would like to visit America. in fact to settle in it: How much mony[money] would it take to buy travel? for a fellow to live on decently? I of course am no Farmer, but I would like to live a Farmer's life and dont[don't] see any chance here. Land's so dear, I am only a bad sailor or else I would have been on my way to see you this year: I often have long wished to see your country and its people, and I yearned to see it and them just in the way you have done—so you see I see them through your eyes and so love them all and you to[too]—Thomas Dixon Thomas Dixon to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1876"
