    "text": "New HavenMay 24th 1876Mr Walt WhitmanDear SirI want to get your new book (the \"Two Rivulets\" I think it is called) for a friend of mine on his next Birthday July 1st 1876. I asked for it at one of the largest book stores in this place but they did not have it, so I thought the best way would be to write to you. I would much prefer to send to you for it if you will be kind enough to send it please let me know the price. My friend is a great admirer of yours. him and I have lately been reading your \"Leaves of Grass\" and \"Drum Taps\" and we are very much pleased with them. I admire and respect you very much for the way in which you write about Mr Abraham Lincoln, our Brave Soldiers, and the African race. I think Mr Lincoln was one of the best men that ever lived. our Soldiers we can not praise them to[too] much and the poor blacks needs the sympathy of every good man and woman on earth.If you will be kind enough to notice this note please write a line to Rachel. M. Cox. 63. St.Street John. St.Street New Haven Conn.Connecticutand oblige Yours TrulyMiss R. M. CoxP.S. This friend of mine that I write about wrote to you some time ago perhaps you remember him. his name is C. W. Hine. I know he would appreciate one of your Books better than anything else I could give himR. M. C.from Miss R M CoxNew Haven R. M. Cox to Walt Whitman, 24 May 1876"
