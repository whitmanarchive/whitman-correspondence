    "text": "Sunday noonJune 2 '89Horace, I was just thinking the pamphlet notion might be improved & expanded on by having a nicely 60 or 70 page (thick good paper, with portrait for front piece) book, trimmed & gilt edged—good job—bound in crepe—thick paper (like my Passage to India, robin-blue-egg color with white inside)—to be publish'd by Dave, & sold at 50cts retail—to be call'dCamden's Complimentto Walt Whitman on his finishing his 70th yearputting in enough appropriate stuff to the occasion & latest developements—(if needed) to make out 60 or 70 pp—Mention this to Tom, Harry Bonsall & Buckwalter—then see if Dave w'd undertake & publish it at his expense—I don't think it needed be stereotyped—print it f'm the types—1000 copies—Us here, Dr B, Tom, other Camdenites, Johnston in N Y, &c, to subscribe for 100 & pay the cash down when ready—The more I think of it this way, the more I believe it worth doing, & that it will pay for itself, at least—& I think Dave will go in—(no great risk or money investment any how.) The whole thing of the dinner was such a success & really a wonder it ought to be commemorated—W WHorace TraubelShow this to T. B. Harned, Harry Bonsall, Buckwalter—& then to David McKay.
