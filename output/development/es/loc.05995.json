    "text": "Camden April 12 '87.Dear friendI send you Herbert's last letter—he expects to come over in May—He has sent me his book ab't Mrs. G—It is very interesting—Shall I bring or send it down for you to read, or have you one?—Harry left here ab't an hour ago—he went up to the Hospital to-day, & the throat was operated on again—but he feels pretty well & in good spirits—I am sorry to hear George and Ed are not well—I hope they will be over the worst of it, & indeed all right by this time—I am going to New York to-morrowevn'g,evening to return Friday if I live through it all. I may drive down next Sunday if it is pleasant— Walt WhitmanC/. Leonard M. Brown.THE GLEBE HOUSE.HUNSTANTON.S.C.NORFOLK.31st March 1887.My Dear Walt,As you see by my address I am staying with a great friend of yours. You may see him this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,—going out as a schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently unobserved by the rest of his orthodox family.I posted a copy of my book to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and tell me how you like it.Andrew Lang wrote a leader in the Daily News about it and fine things have been said in the London, and Scotch Press particularly. As yet, I have not taken my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &with love fromHerbert H. Gilchrist. Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 12 April 1887"
