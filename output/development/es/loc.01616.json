    "text": "Furze Down, Streatham, SurreySunday April 23, 1871My dear Mr. WhitmanI wonder if you have quite forgotten me. I know the first thing you will very naturally do will be to look to the end of this letter endeavourendeavor to decipher the signature, & then maybe get to thinking of when & where & how it comes to pass that you hear from one—you will then I hope remember that some months ago (in the Early part of December I think it was for I know Washington was busy with preparations for the reopening of Congress). I came to see you in yryour office at the Treasury—And we had a long walk & talk together. I then promised that I would write to you when I reached England perhaps you have thought me forgetful. I hope not for indeed I think of you very very often & though sometimes one feels as if there were a huge gulf between this and America at others again the thousands of miles of sounding sea seems but as a very little space & I must say that since I have crossed this ferry—shaken hands upon the other side the distance seems as nothing & the desire to return once more gets stronger every day—I have been very, very much occupied & intensely busy one way & another arrears of work claimed my attention for you know I am not a \"briefless barrister\" & latterly my work has increased but I have determined that this glorious spring time shall not pass without my carrying out the my[my] intention of scribbling to you.I think that most countries are perhaps most beautiful in spring time certainly England is to my mind—you know the whole country looks like one lovely garden bursting forth into new life. Every shade of green— the grass like Emeralds, & the perfect effects of light & shadow & really what with the songs of birds, the smell of the flowers the clouds the rainbows & sunlights as I see them & hear them all over this my room One can almost for the time forget care & sorrow & believe that after all this is Paradise—& so it is if one will only make it so. I long for you very often to see all this country. It is so different & yet so like to yours. Differences, I think very great yet almost indistinguishable, certainly for the most part differences which can be better felt than exprestexpressed. When are you coming—What month—what week in what steamer. I know you will go to Brooklyn & then for Xingcrossing in the Ferry boat among the crowd of people & I hear the bells jangling & I see the great Comander'sCommander's coming from us to you & going from you to us. & then you will meet Yr.your mother & spend with her a few days. & then will you not cross again to the great new york and walk straight to the office take ticket & spend 9 days of yryour holiday upon the great Atlantic—land at L'poolLiverpool and come on to me. Remember you promised that you would do so and I have been counting and relying upon yryour promise and am very very anxious to show you all I can & to see you again.I must tell you that I gave Alfred Tennyson yryour books.he was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of yryour deep regard for him & that you were coming over here this year which seemed to please him, and I can promise you from him too a hearty welcome. Indeed until you come, you can hardly I think understand how many friends you have. I do not know that I have very much news to tell you for really yryour papers contain all. I seemed to know more of what was going on here when I was \"over there\" than I do now somehow.Lowe our Chancellor of ExchequerChancellor of the Exchequer has just taken a leaf out of the transatlantic page & taxed matches. I think if I remember the tax has been a very bad one with you, & led to many evil results. here there is a general dislike to itSwinburne goes on writing a good deal he has been ill very ill. It is fearful to see his life utterly wretched & unmanly I think it seems that his craving for drink is quite incurable—Now I am not going to write any more just at present but will write again soon & hope that perhaps before very long I may hear from you—& that you are well.Any news you may have will you say, & anything you think will be very welcome & intensely interesting to me, but if you tell me that you have finally reached to come over to us directly this will be then most pleasing of all—this will delight me—I send you a little book written by a friend of mine printed only for private circulation, it is rather prettily done I think, not perhaps very original & wanting in power, but still there is something engaging about it— He is an artist with a spark of the divine light in him to be sure—Yours my dear WaltVery affectionatelyCyril Flower Cyril Flower to Walt Whitman, 23 April 1871"
