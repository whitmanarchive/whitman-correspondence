    "text": "See notes August 6, '88Washington, D.C.Life-Saving Service,August 3, 1888.Dear Walt:I enclose for your information a letter I got yesterday from Dr. Channing about the calendar, which reads well.Today I have a letter from Stedman, in which he cordially undertakes the task of getting a publisher. I think this very good of him, as he is quite driven with all sorts of commissions.I feel sorry that the delay of last year, prevented our getting Mr. Stetson to draw the picture I wrote you of for the card, because he is a man of singular genius, and appreciates deeply Leaves of Grass, the central sum of which, and permeating all its parts without exception, is, he thinks, spirituality. I think he would have given us something rarely good — something artistically bold, anyway, though maybe not. But he cannot do it this year, and I understand is getting ready to go for study to Italy.I did not know that the M.S. of the calendar was to be placed in Stedman's hands, but it could not be better nor friendlier.Send me back the letter when you have done with it, that I may write to Dr. Channing, who has been very laborious and earnest in the matter. Grace, the cherub deviser of the scheme, is now up at Bristol, Rhode Island.I have been much comforted by the newspaper reports about you, as by your card of the 27th ultimo, though I realize how badly ill you still must be. But I have strong hopes. If you can but weather the summer!I myself am pretty bad— very back-achy and weak-leggy. But, like Webster, we still live, and who can get us under!I am glad you can sit up and work a little on your book, which must be a comfort.I have another letter from Dr. Bucke, whom I treat disgracefully, not answering promptly. But it is pretty hard to write and keep the office stone rolled up the hill daily.All consolation! All cheer!Affectionately yours,W.D. O'ConnorWalt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 3 August 1888"
