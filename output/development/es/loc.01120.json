I trust you are nearly well by this time & I hope this will find you with your mother & brother. Are you coming to N.Y. & thence to see me? I hope to hear that you are. I can meet you in N.Y. almost any time after next week. To-morrow I am going home to Roxbury to spend one week in sugar making. Wife & I are both well.With much love,John Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 11 April 1873"
