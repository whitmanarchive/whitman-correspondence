I keep well—go out most every day. I suppose you rec'd[received] the Tribune (27th I think) with your letter in, which I sent you—& the other papers I occasionally send. No news particular—I sell a book now & then—No, I have not been to any watering place—they are no company for me—the cities magnificent for their complex play & oceans of eager human faces—But the country or sea for me in some sparse place, old barn & farm house—or bleak sea shore—nobody round—Meanwhile I get along very well here—Walt Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 29 August [1879]"
