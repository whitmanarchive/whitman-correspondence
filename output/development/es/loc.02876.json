    "text": "50 Marquis Rd.Camden Sq.May 14, 1874My dearest FriendTwo papers have come to hand since I last wrote; one containing the memoranda made during the war—precious records, eagerly read & treasured & reread by me. How the busy days slip by, one so like another, yet each with its own fresh & pleasant flavor & scent, as like and as different as the leaves on a tree, or the plants in the hedgerows.Days they are busy with humble enough occupations, but lit up for me not only with the light of hope, but with the half–hidden joy of one who knows she has found what she sought and laid such strong hold upon it that she fears nothing, questions nothing,—no life, or death, nor, in the end, in her own imperfections, flaws, shortcomings. For to be so conscious of these, and to love and understand you so, are proofs that the germs of all are in her, & perhaps in the warmth & joyous sunshine of your presence would grow fast. Anyhow, distance has not baffled her, and time will not. A great deal of needlework to be done at this time of year; for my girls have not time for any at present; it is not a good contrast or the right thing after longish hours of study—much better household activity of any sort. If they would but understand this in schools & colleges for girls & young women! No healthier or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study, could be found than household work—sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing, cooking—in the variety of it, & equable development of the muscles, I should think equal to the most elaborate gymnastics. I know very well how I have felt, & still feel the want of having been put to these things when a girl. Then the importance afterwards of doing them easily & well & without undue fatigue, to all who aim to give practical shape to their ardent belief in equality & fair play for all! In domestic life under one roof, at all events it is already feasible to make the disposals without ignominious distinctions,—not all the rough bodily work never ending, still begining; and the mental culture and abundant leisure all to the other—but a wholesome interchange and sharing of these. Not least too among the advantages of taking an active share in these duties is the zest, the keen relish it gives to the hours not too easily secured for reading & music. Besides, I often think that just as the Poem Nature is made up half of rude, rough realities & homely materials & processes, so it is necessary for women to construct their Poem, Home, on a groundwork of homeliest details & occupations providing for the bodily wants & comforts of their household, and that without putting their own hands to this, their Poem will lack the vital fresh growing nature-like quality that alone endures, and that of this soil will grow, with fitting preparation & culture a noble & more vigorous intellectual life in women, fit to embody itself in wider spheres afterwards—if the call comes. This month of May that comes to you so laden with great and sorrowful & beautiful & tender memories, and that is your birth month too, I cannot say that I think of you more than at any other time, for there is no month nor day that my thoughts do not habitually & spontaneously turn to you, refer all to you; yet I seem to come closer, because of the Poems that tell me of what relates to that time; but most of all when I think of your beloved Mother, because then I often yearn, more than I know how to bear, to comfort you with love and tender care and silent companionship. May is in a sense (& a very real one) my birth month too, for in it were your Poems first put into my hand. I wish so I were quite sure that you no longer suffer in your head, and that you can move about without effort or difficulty—perhaps before long there will be a paper with some paragraph about your health, for though we say to ourselves no news is good news, it is a very different thing to have the absolute affirmation of good news. My children are all well and hearty I am thankful to say, & working industriously. Grace means to study the best system of Kinder garten teaching—I fancy she is well suited for Kinder garten teaching & that it is very excellent work— Herby is still drawing from the antique in the British Museum. I hope he will get into the Academy this summer. He is going to spend his holidays with his brother in South Wales—and we as usual at Colne, but that will not be till August. Did I tell you William Rossetti and his bride were spending their honeymoon at Naples? & have found it bitterly cold there I hear—Mr. & Mrs. Conway & their children are well. Eustace is coming to spend the afternoon with Herby to–morrow. Good–bye, my dearest Friend.Annie Gilchrist. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 14 May 1874"
