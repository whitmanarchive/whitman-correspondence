    "text": "Belmont June 8 / 88Dear Walt Whitman;â€”Mr Harned has written me of yryour recent attack of illness. It was at first quite alarming. But thank God it was no worse. I wont weary you by saying more than to express my heartfelt sympathy & thankfulness & good wishes. I sent Mr Harned's letter to John B., & suggested his sending it to O'Connor. Mrs Fairchild asks affectionately after you. She is just going to England.W.S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 8 June 1888"
