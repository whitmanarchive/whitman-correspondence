    "text": "431 Stevens st cor West.Camden, N.J.Friday forenoon 11½Jan 74?16th Jan 74Well son, how do you make out this cold weather?—for I suppose you are having it there as we are here—we had quite a snow storm here three or four nights ago, & since then it has cleared off bitter cold,—(thermometer at 10 above, an hour ago, at our west door.)—Still I go out some, though very stiff—& lately some spells in my head rather bad & queer. What I have said in former letters about my general strength still holds good—otherwise I am in a bad way yet & dontdon't consider myself out of the woods, have not been so well as usual the last week If you come across the Weekly Graphic just out get it, as I have commenced a series of pieces about things just before & during the war. The series is to continue through four or five numbers. Get one for Mr & Mrs. Nash—Pete I rec'd the \"Golden Grain\"—also the letter, Herald,—& RepubRepublican—send me one of the latter, occasionally—I had rather have it than any—(but you needn't put yourself out to get it)—As I write the sun is shining bright & clear as can be—the ground is white with snow in all directions, it is not melting anywhere—as I crossed the river yesterday toward dusk, the old fellow, the chargè of the ferry house, told me that between 12 & 2 o'clock the previous night over 30 persons crowded in there, poor houseless creatures, to keep from freezing to death—he keeps a great stove red-hot all night—some were young, some old, some evidently real respectable people—the orders are to not allow it, but he hadn't the heart to turn 'em out—God help the homeless & moneyless this weather—Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, [16 January 1874]"
