    "text": "Syracuse, N.Y.August 10, 1869.My Dear Walt.You do not know me—have never heard of me even—yet you have done more for me than all others.Born and bred in the midst of Puritanical orthodoxy I was early entombed in the church and never had a breath of the pure, free air of heaven till I was thirty-five years old. Swedenborg first opened the sepulchre and let in the heavenly light so that I saw myself a living soul, but it remained for you to breathe upon the dry bones and make them live. To you alone I owe the discovery that \"Divine am I inside and out\"—that the \"body is not less sacred than the soul.\"Hours of depression come even upon you. This I know. Therefore, perhaps, it may cheer you in some such hour to know how you have lifted up and made happy a brother. This is my apology for this intrusion.I would I could grasp your hand, look in your eyes and have you look in mine. Then you should see how much you have done for me.Yours with a brother's loveWilliam A. Hawley William A. Hawley to Walt Whitman, 10 August 1869"
