    "text": "London, Ont.,24 April 1890I have your note of Sunday, enclosing letter from Barnard O'Dowd of Melbourne, Australia. Also your card of 22d and \"Camden Post\" of same date. I have read all with great interest. Have been from home a couple of days on asylum business that is why I am answering all in a lump—got home last ev'g. I guess \"La Grippe\" is still sticking to you—(she is the devil to stick)—and is making you feel miserable—but patience! (you used to have a good stock but must be getting toward the bottom of it I should think) the worst is over and the dregs of it will be run out in a little while now. Mrs Bucke and little Pardee got back home yesterday from their five weeks' visit in Sarnia with various friends there—I am happy to saythey are both looking better for the rest and change. Nothing settled yet about muy visit east but hope to leave (as mentioned before) about 12th May.Very pleasant weather here now—cool and bright—vegetation is coming forward quite slowly (as I like to see it—less likely to be cut back by frost)—Love to you alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 April 1890"
