    "text": "1 Torriano GardensCamden RdLondonFeb 25,/76My dearest Friend,I received the paper & enclosed slip Saturday week—filling me so full of emotion I could not write—for I am too bitterly impatient of mere words. Soon, very soon I come my darling. I am not lingering, but held yet a little while by the firm grip of conscience—this is the last spring we shall be asunder—O I passionately believe there are years in store for us— years of tranquil, tender happiness—me making your outward life serene & sweet—you making my inward life so rich—me learning, growing, loving—we shedding benign influences round us out of our happiness and fulfilled life—Hold on but a little longer for me my Walt—I am straining every nerve to hasten the day—I have enough for us all—with the simple, unpretending ways we both love best. Percy is battling slowly doing as well as we could expect in the time. I think he will soon build the nest for his mate. I think he never in his heart believed I really should go to America and so it comes as a great blow to him now. You must be very indulgent towards him for my sake dear Friend.I am glad we know about those rascally book agents—for many of us are wanting a goodish number of copies of the new edition & it is important to understand we may have them straight from you—Rossetti is making a list of the friends & the number, so that they may all come together—Perhaps dearest friend you may be having a great difficulty in getting the books out for want of funds—if so let me help a little—show your trust in me and my love thus generously.Your own lovingAnnie.Mrs. Gilchrist Feb. 25 '76 ansanswer: March 17: Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 25 February 1876"
