    "text": "Dear SirI feel that as my brothers friend you have been neglected but owing to sickness in the family having been away most of the time I have not had much spare time. Caleb is not quite as well as when I wrote you before. He can not sit up at all. He was very much pleased with your letter & he wishes me to tell you to keep writing if you do not hear from him first. for your letters do him more good than a great deal of medicine. He wants to know if you will be so kind as to ask Dr. Bliss what he must do to have his furlough extended if he should not be able to come back then. His head troubles him very much and I fear he will not be able to come back for a long time if ever through he will not own it. Hoping to hear from you again soon I will now close, Yours Respectfully Mary A. Babbitt to Walt Whitman, 6 September 1863"
