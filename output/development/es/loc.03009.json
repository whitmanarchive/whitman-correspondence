    "text": "BelmontMay 11 89 10 a. m.I have been holding yr card announcing the death of Wm D. O'C in my hand at arm's length for several minutes trying to realize its import. Death always comes as a shock & surprise. But a man with so intense a hold on life—so alive in every atom of him—well—I draw a long sigh, and like you I suppose, gather what is left of me together in resignation—reluctant acquiesence in the order of the universe.My regret is keen that I did not meet our noble & brilliant friend.I hope that you will not succumb to this blow, but feel that the rest of yr friends are at yr side. How can we really believe in death? It is in yr writings, & there alone that I have found the deepest glimpses into death-realm. You have made it life-realm to me—given me an idea of it grand in mystic possibilities.W. S. Kennedy.So glad to hear of the out-door chair. I mark an item in Transcript abt O'Connor's death, your card preceded it by 5 minutes. I suppose Burroughs may attend the funeral? Dear, dear, can it be?—O'C. dead!! The dreaded moment come at last? God help us all.Please write me abt O'C when you are able—any items.Sunday Morn. May 12.What I wrote last night perhaps had better not have been written. In yr deep grief silence wd have been better. I wish you know the depth of my own feeling the tumultuous emotional depths—sort of despair—stirred up always by death. And I wish I cd. make you feel how all day I have grieved & meditated.As you cannot go out, let me try to give you a picture as setting for this day's solemn (Sunday) meditation (with me) on the sacred theme of comrades life & death. My days are passed in the harrowing uproar of a great printing estab. & it is hard for me to find a soul-hour.I rose early, went down into the little parlor—neat as wax—& looked over our dead friend's \"Hamlet's Note-Book,\" and especially a long six page brilliant letter fr. him to me anent the Shaksp. controversy, the Elizabethan Age &c. How I prize that letter now!The dew had formed thick as rain in the night, & I went out (the sweetest apple-blossom day of the year,—day) & absorbed the scene, the freshness, the idyllic quiet—not a sound anywhere—soft warm mist hanging over Boston & Strawberry Hill, the latter covered with apple trees in bloom. Three or four golden robins were clipping about thro' the air, singing & chirping. Presently over in the pines a brown thrush struck up. Nature—the apparition—seemed so strong & fair: was not W.m D. O'C dead—if one rightly regarded it—just as much in harmony with the scene as my part of the life-throbbing whole? \"What is good for the whole of nature is good also for a part\"Then I went down thro' the fresh woods & fields, fairly sheeted with blue violets & yellow-gleaming butter-cups, with here & there a fragile columbine pouring out its horns of perfume into the air. I usually refrain fr. picking wild-flowers; but in pensive mood I this time plucked a large handful of the largest & deepest-colored—as for the hearse of our dear friend—to waft their incense to his soul now merged in the dark Unconscious, resolved back into silence and dream.I am glad he is at rest fr. his suffering, if it was to be.Can I be of any service here to Mrs O'C.?I feel well that I know but a small fraction of the friendship & long years of devotion bet. you & him.Let me therefore be silent.W. S. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 11–12 May 1889"
