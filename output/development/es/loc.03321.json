    "text": "Washington, D.C.December 21, 1886.Dear WaltI enclose the two books by express, and will write you later. You need not return them until called for, if at all. Charley Eldridge sent them to me, I don't know yet whether as a gift or a loan. So take your time at them. I find on carefully reading the \"Quarterly,\" that I should greatly qualify my first impression of its merits. Still, it is good, and its source gives it weight, and great significance. I am badly off today, so excuse crudity and brevity. I hope you'll have a comfortable Christmas.Affectionately,W D O'ConnorWalt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 21 December 1886"
