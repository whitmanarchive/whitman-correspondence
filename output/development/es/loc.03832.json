    "text": "CamdenMarch 4 P MThanks for your dear kind note of last week—I have been quite ill—the doctor says mainly a lesion or trouble, (physical) brain centre, other botherations too—but as I write this towards evening I have the very definite feeling of the worst having passed, & that I shall be better in a day or two—I feel so to-day already—& soon about as usual—No my friend there is nothing you can specially do for me (I should frankly tell you, if there was.) Mary's and Logan's visit Sunday through the storm was a real comfort to me—(more a help than they knew.) I wish dear Alys would take the earliest convenient opportunity to give my excuses & love to Mr and Mrs: Williams, and Churchy—I have had this trouble on me now for over three weeks—It is very lonesome here—If I had not been born with a happy-tending natural disposition (I inherit it from my mother) the last few weeks—yes the last ten years—would have been unmitigated darkness & heaviness to me—As it is, the ennuyeed hours have been the rare exceptions—Then about the shows of life & my experience in them I am deeper & deeper impressed the older I grow thattherealsomethinghasyetto beknown—It is well I am physically ballasted so strong, with weightiest animality & appetites, or I should go off in a balloon—Well luckily for you my friend I have come to the end of the paper—W W Walt Whitman to Robert Pearsall Smith, 4 March [1884]"
