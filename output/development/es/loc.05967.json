    "text": "51 Fort Ave/Roxbury/Boston MassJuly 27th/82Walt Whitman—Dear Friend Your kind note of the 26th is received also the package—& \"Leaves of Grass\"—both of which are to me more precious than gold. I sent you yesterday a copy of my paper containing the lecture Keep off the Grass. As it may be withheld by the P O. Officials I send you one to day enclosed in a new book that I have just published. The whole edition of my paper is still held at the Post Office awaiting decision from Washington as to its alleged indecency by PMPostmaster. Tobey. As in my next number I shall have the whole history of this infamous impertinence and audacity in print I will not weary you with writing it here—. I have received a very kind note from Mr O'Connor from whose splendid article I quoted—containing the offer of his kind offices at Washington. As I cannot think there can be another edition-of-such-holy impurity and-insensibility to all the sacred rights of man as Tobey I hope soon to have it in circulation I have a circulation of 2600—scattered all over the Union—Canada—& a few of them in England Scotland France Switzerland Italy Australia New Zealand & the West Indies among whom you have many ardent admirers—When I first lectured from Leaves of Grass I received many expressions of gratitude from them—I am sorry that last Winter I allowed a press of business to lead me to postpone calling on you until I found that it was too late—. I am however loath to intrude my self on public personages—as I know that much of their valuable time is thus wasted.—I shall however always feel as though I have touched your soul & felt the beating of your heart near to mine in the few kind words you have sent me—and whenever I read Leaves of Grass your personal inscription on the fly leaf—will make every line fragrant with your love. Your friendGeorge Chainey George Chainey to Walt Whitman, 27 July 1882"
