    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,20 Dec 1888I have your note of 18th enclosing Kennedy's note in re the \"Solitude\" piece. I wonder if Lowell really presented it to library as yours and if so what he meant by it? It will amount to nothing any how, am glad you wrote K. explicitly denying authorship. You do not seem to gain very fast, still it seems to me that you are on the mend. I trust you will soon be well enough to resume the big book, get cover settled &c. We are all well, this is Clare's birthday (my oldest girl) she is 18 today. No further word from Willy Gurd I expect him every day now—I am heartily glad you like Dr Walsh—I think you are well off as to doctors and nurse now—Osler, Walsh & Wilkins it is a strong team and we ought to see some result of their care of you—day by day I watch the post for news of you and I still look confidently for a good rally on your part soon nowI am, dear Walt,affectionately yoursR M Buckesee notes 12/26/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 December 1888"
