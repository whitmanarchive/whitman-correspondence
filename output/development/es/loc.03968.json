    "text": "Camden, New Jersey.April 21, 1877.Spring has at last commenced. The buds are out on the trees, the early flowers are in bloom, the days have grown to a much greater length, the fields of rye and wheat show their beautiful carpet of emerald, the farmers are busy planting their corn and potatoes, and all Nature exhibits the plainest evidencs[evidences] that the delightful season for flowers, vegetables, fruits, grains, and the foliage of Summer is again commencing.Common as it is in the experience of every one of us, nothing is more wonderful than the annual return of spring: The dead ground awakening by some mysterious process to all the miracles of life is a spectacle, common as it is, not surpassed in all the infinite processes of the Universe.Amid these wonders and glories, the passions and ambitions of mankind and the objects of their pride and eagerness seem artificial and petty. There is a healthy and elevating lesson in studying the spring.Saturday evening, end of the weekWe have had a couple of rainy Apriel[April]. It is now a fine evening, partially clear, with an occasionals[occasional] gust of wind, it and the moon at times shining out brightly. Mr Whitman and I are sitting here in the room togeather[together]; he is reading the New York Herald, and I am writing these lines for exercise for exercise. To day we received a newspaper from our friend the artist George Waters of Elmira N.Y. It contained an article on W. W. portrait, painted by Mr. Waters during our late visit to New York; also an interesting extract from the last letter writen[written] by our lamented hostess, the very day before her sudden death. Of corse[course] we were glad to here[hear] from our friend, though the newspaper and letter brought up some very sad recollectionsOn Monday next I expect to commence work a gain[again] at the printing of the West Jersey Press.Yours,Harry Stafford.Sunday April 22 1877.It is a beautiful morning and you are feeling well and hearty. My friend and I, he says, have had a happy night and morning. I am bound for Kirkwood in the next train Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 21 April 1877"
