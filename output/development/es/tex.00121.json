    "text": "Cohoctah, Michigan,March 10, 1863Mr. WhitmanDear SirI am seated in an easy chair pen in hand trying to scribble a few lines to you. I expect it will take me all day to write this for I cant sit up but a few moments at a time. I was taken down with chills & fever when I got to Pittsburg. I stayed there from Saturday night until Monday morning before any train left I dont[don't] think I ever was so sick in my life as I was in Pittsburg I about gave up there that I never should get home alive, but there was a Dr there he gave me some medison[medicine] he said that would take me home & it did.We was behind time at most every place we changed cars so we had to wait I expected to have got home in three days at the outside but instead of three I was six.It dont[don't] look much like winter here there is not a parrticle[particle] of snow on the ground & its about such weather as it was in Washington although its not quite so muddy There hasnt[hasn't] been any sleighing here this winter & there wont be now its to late in the seasonThey are making maple sugar in this part of the world now when I get well I will eat some for you but I suppose you think that wont do you much good.I tell you I am glad I am out of that Hospital & when I get into another to stay I will let you know it.Oh how are you getting along with your office I am in hopes you have recd it before this time I begun to think that your office & my discharge had gone to the same place now I have got my papers I think you had ought to receive yoursI cant write any more this time my hand trembles so I can hardly write but I will try & do better next time give my best respects to Mr & Mrs O Connor. Yours &c.PS Write soon Justus F. Boyd to Walt Whitman, 10 March 1863"
