    "text": "R. WORTHINGTON,PUBLISHER,750 BROADWAY.New York, SeptSeptember 29th 1879.Mr Walt WhitmanCamdenN.J.Dear Sir:We have recently purchased at the Auction Rooms of Messrs Geo. A. Leavitt Co of this city the electrotype plates of an edition of your \"Leaves of Grass\" bearing the imprint of Thayer and Eldridge, Boston 1860â€“61. As the edition is not complete although subject as I understand to a copyright of ten percent it seems to me that it would be better for all parties to have it completed. If this idea meets your views on the subject I would be willing to make you an immediate payment of $250.00 on account and will do everything in my power to make the book sell. An early reply would obligeYour TrulyR. WorthingtonP.S. Porter & Coates, Claxton Remsen & Hafflefinger of Philadelphia or Gebbie & Harris or any of the leading Houses of the country would inform you that I am perfectly responsible & that you are sure of getting your copyright.R. W. Richard Worthington to Walt Whitman, 29 September 1879"
