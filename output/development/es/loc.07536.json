Rec'd y'rs of evn'g Dec. 25th—3 P M—Passing an easier day upon the whole—have just eaten chocolate ice cream—read y'rs of 24th a second time—I guess I am getting along pretty well, considering everything—to have the books off my mind is a great relief—If I can now be freed of this gastric, head & feeble trouble—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 27 December 1888"
