    "text": "Camden1883 March 31 noonMy dear friendI send you the second proofs—look over carefully for technicals, misspelling of names, & in the Italian text on Page 109 &c—but make no changes or alterations. If we were to begin the setting of the copy de novo you should certainly be obeyed in every detail & minutest particular—& I know I should like the result well enough. But I like wonderfully well the whole presentations just as they appear here—& I know you will too, either right off, or soon as you get accustomed to them. Besides the matter itself, after being faithfully given as to text & with typographic cleanliness & propriety, makes remaining points not worth dwelling on. Taken together the Introductory Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] are so tremendous & vehement, so beautiful & orbic in themselves—so fitting for the body of the volume (almost its heart & lungs)—so honest & subtle, as well as stupendous, a eulogy and dissertation, on L of GLeaves of Grass, & on certain primary & spinal literary laws—so assuring a pedestal for my future fame—& as here printed so satisfactory in their type, style & paragraphing &c. as they stand that any change in those particulars would be worse than unnecessary—would be fatuous—I keep well—Write me often as you can—tell me all the news—your own movements as much as you can—Did you get the parcel of books?Walt WhitmanKeep the proof two days after you get it if you wish— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 31 March 1883"
