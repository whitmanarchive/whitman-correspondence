    "text": "CamdenMarch 16 '83 NoonMy dear friendYours of 14th & proofs of 1883 Letter rec'dreceived—All y'ryour marks will be attended to—the Emerson passages put in as you desire—the text minutely adhered to—every correction carried out—with the single exception (if you will allow it, as I personally request you will) of restoring the italic non-quoted names of books, &c. The typographical plan was laid out by the Superintendant in the printing office & agreed to by the publisher & myself—I stipulated that your text should be adhered to without the slightest variation—but gave in to the type & technique business, so as to have a certain system & uniformity which those names as printed come under—But it does not involve any material point & I know you will be entirely satisfied when you come to see the Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] in the printed book—Also I request you will allow a few certain ¶ breaks in the G G P—not at all affecting the text—but helping the typography & reader—I think most decidedly helping—The foot note (early part of G G P) is printed I see exactly as in copy—If not the true note, send it on as you wish, & it shall appear verbatim—(we have no fear of scarifying Lowell)—If the exigencies of the printing office allow I will have a revise sent you—but it is not certain—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 16 March 1883"
