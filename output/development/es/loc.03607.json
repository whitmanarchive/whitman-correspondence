It escaped me to mention in my previous letter that a Mr. Ernest Rhys not heretofore known to me (59 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London) called on me 2 or 3 weeks ago, wishing to obtain your address—wh.which I gave him. He intended, as I understood, to write to you with a view to entering into some terms regarding a London edition of your Poems. He seemed to me to have a genuine feeling of regard for yourself & your works, & he asked me to convey to you an expression of his feeling when next I shdshould write. Yours always,W. M. Rossetti.from W M Rossetti 6 Oct. '85 | enclosing p o order ￡37.12 William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 6 October 1885"
