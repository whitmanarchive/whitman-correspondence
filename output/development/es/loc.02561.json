Don't know why I have not come on to N Y to visit you—but I think of you all—you Alma & Ally—with the same old love, & shall be with you again before long. John, I am not favorable to the select extracts plan you mentioned four or five weeks ago—Get the next Baldwin's Monthly—it has a little reminiscence of mine in it—I go out to Germantown quite frequently—have some very good Quaker friends there—long rides every afternoon—A spell of real winter here, cold, snow, fog, &c—but bright & sunny to-day as I write.Happy New Years to all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 29 December 1883"
