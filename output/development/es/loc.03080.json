    "text": "BelmontEve. Sept 10, '90.Dear W W:â€”I kept elaborating the Dutch art. It is now in Clement's hands (ed. Transcript) & will appear soon I guess. I read up Taine's rich little \"Art in the Netherlands,\" &c & have made a bit of work I think. I am not much in touch with Miss Gilder & her dilettante shut. So tho't I cd read the proof of article better in TranscriptI have wanted to say for long that I have read 3 lines yr excellent article in Critic. Its choice & weighty diction makes us fellows despair. Walt, you have gained not lost one whit, as a prose writer. As for poetry, it must come when man is at the loft of his condition you know.affecW. S. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 10 September 1890"
