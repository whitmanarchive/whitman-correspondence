    "text": "CamdenMay 17 noonBen Ticknor has just been here, to make a settlement of the L of G publication business between me and Osgood & Co.—which settlement has been amicably effected—and O & Co. have withdrawn & given it up for good, & made the plates &c over to me—What I write for is this:—Ben. tells me that the whole business originated from the State Attorney General Mr Marston, who (at the instance of certain parties) peremptorily instructed the Boston Dist.District Attorney Stevens to proceed against L of G. As I wrote you before, the betes noir were To a common prostitute and A woman waits for me. Unless those were left out he was instructed to indict and arrest to the law's extremity. (I believe I told you that Osgood & Co. formally notified me that they would continue the publication if those were expurgated.)I do not myself feel any resentment toward O & Co. for any thing done me or the book—They have acted with reference to conventional business & other circumstances. Marston is the target for you—If I learn more I will notify you—WWHave you seen my N ANorth American Rev.Review article? I expect some proof-impressions & will immediately send you two or three— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 17 May [1882]"
