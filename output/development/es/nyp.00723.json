    "text": "CamdenNov: 9 night '88I have had a pretty good week so far—am either throwing off (or easying) some of the worst bad subjections and grips—My big book (collection of all) is all printed, & paid for & at the binders delaying for one or two little things—it is nothing more than you have seen—but I had a great desire for all to be combined, comprehended at one glance—and here it is—of course I shall send you a copy—I am sitting yet in my sick room now in my usual big chair by the oak wood fire, & alone. I have plenty visitors enough & good ones—my appetite & sleep are fair—I have a new helper & nurse, a clean strong kind hearted young Kanuck man Dr. Bucke sent me—All indeed goes as well & comfortable as could be expected with me—And how with you? I think of you every day—& most all my friends coming here ask ab't you—I rec'd the letter last week & thankful & ask for more—I cannot say I enthuse on H[arrison]'s election—but I accept it—all right for what it goes—Dr. B. is probably coming this way in a week—Best love to you & to Nelly.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 9 November 1888"
