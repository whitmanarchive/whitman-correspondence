John Burroughs sends second edition of his \"Notes\"—Your letter of 8th July has reached me—I hope to write you more fully & answer it from Washington city—My address is still there—(& always, always glad to hear from you, my friend.)I am still blest with the greatest health, & have been enjoying this fine summer here exceedingly. My \"Leaves of Grass\" I consider substantially finished, as in the copies I send you. To \"Democratic Vistas\" it is my plan to add much, if I live. I have read carefully the article in the Westminster If you learn for certain who wrote it, I should be glad to know—It is a profound & eloquent essay—& I am proud to be the subject of it—I have received much comfort from your country—here little but refusal or coldness.I conclude by sending best respects & love. Indeed, my friend, I wish to hear from you oftener. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 28 July 1871"
