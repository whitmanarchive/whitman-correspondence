    "text": "Dear Walt,I received your Welcome letter on the 8 insinstant accompanied With a copy of New York Herald  I am Very thankful for the Paper  but i think your description of the Procession beats theirs all to pieces  I can almost imagine myself Wedged & Blocked in on a 3rd Ave car. Nothing of interest here at present every thing looks Very Dull & Miserable  yesterday & today is Very Cold  leaves all falling off the trees strewing the ground in every direction  since i wrote last, i came across Sydnor driver of 7th St  he is well & doing first rate  he sends his love & best respect. Mr. Hart got on my car last night on my last trip. We had a long conversation about everything in general  first we commenced on home affairs  he is troubled a good deal about a house he bought & now wants to get rid of it  We next started on Politics  he would Vote for Grant but he is no Radical & last we wound up with Newspapers  he wants to start a paper here soon  he is tired of working for others  You may not be interested with his affairs so i will come to close  excuse this short letter as my car is going to start & i want to put this in the mail  good bye  My Dear friendPetei will write a long one next Sunday as i am off Peter Doyle to Walt Whitman, [9 October 1868]"
