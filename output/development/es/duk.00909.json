    "text": "CamdenSaturday P MJan: 5 '89Nothing very notable or different. Your letters rec'd & welcomed—Transcript also—hearty thanks for y'r services & promptness in conveying the books—yes I will leave you to pay express tax—but I had meant to refund—I have rec'd from every one letters of acknowledgm't &c. (Mrs: Fairchild's to you is here enclosed return'd)—Baxter's splended notice & setting-forth of the book, in Herald of last Thursday, is rec'd, & seems to me the most complete & most friendly & penetrating (from the point of view of an absorber, believer & democrat) I have ever had—Dr Bucke will have a good time over it—I hear from B often—he is well, busied with his large family, with the Asylum, & with that meter invention I suppose you have heard of. O'Connor keeps on, but is badly off I fear. Burroughs is pretty well—We have had a long stretch of the finest weather, but to-day is dark & wet & glum enough—but I feel comparatively comfortable. I live on mutton-broth & milk & dry toast—sit up most of the day—have read Tolstoi & (it seems to me) all Carlyle's letters—& have enough. Much obliged with the Trans[cript] ¶ on big book—Sunday, Jan: 6All continues well—glum weather, however—I am sitting here by the oak fire comfortable—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 5–6 January 1889"
