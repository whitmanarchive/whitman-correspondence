    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario26 Oct. '90Well, dear Walt, here I am safely settled down at home again and Horace is here with me—I wish he could stay for a good visit but I believe he will have to leave us in a very few days. I have been at work all this morning getting ready my first lecture on insanity for the students; which lecture I deliver tomorrow after-noon—2 to 4—We got home, as I guess you know, friday evening about 7 o'clock—All yesterday I was very busy looking into matters which had accumulated in my absence and today, as I have said, about my lecture. Tomorrow morning Clare leaves home for Chicago and the west—she will visit in Indiana and, I think, Tennesee before she returns home.Horace & I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow—Horace, I think, is quite anxious about being away from you so long. I found Mrs Bucke and all the children quite well on my return and Horace will tell you all about them when he sees you. Horace is quite struck with Pardee (your old favorite) and thinks him a splended boy—as indeed he is.It is cold today and dark and windy as well; we shall soon be having snow and real wintry weather here. I have been showing Horace something of my W.W. collection and H. is to take some copies of L. of G. (old eds.) back with him to have you put your name in them.—Goodby[Goodbye] dear WaltLove to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 26 October 1890"
