    "text": "12 Bootham TerraceJuly 21st 1884Dear Sir I received the book quite safely this morning, & thank you very much for sending it, it was a very good thought of Edward Carpenter to ask you to send it to me, & just like him to know how pleased I should be to receive it from your own hands. I do indeed feel proud to have it direct from the Author, & to have my name written in it by himself. I should like to take this opportunity if you will allow me, of thanking you for all the help I have & do get, from your books. You do not know me, I have never spoken one word to you til to-day, but I know you. You have spoken to me many words of help, & encouragement & reproof, & direction, & of all kinds & I feel very grateful to you for them, & for all the pleasure I have had in reading your books, & I shall always be grateful to Mr Carpenter also, for introducing them to me. They contain messages for all times & people, & for all sorts & conditions of men, but it seems to me they are especially good & most glad tidings to common place, ordinary plain people, with few gifts & no graces like myself. Also most truly a message of love & tenderness & sympathy to the despised & downtrodden of the earth. I so often think of these words of yours, \"Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well off just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession.\" I shall never forget how struck I was with the truth & beauty of verses 16 17 & 18 on page 105 in Leaves of Grass the first time I read them, it so often came to me as I go about amongst the sick & poor, especially the poor in the Workhouse Hospital. That for many people there seems no place at all no one wants them everyone seems glad when they drop out of the procession, & yet most of those men & women in the hospital, have worked hard much too hard as their bent backs declare, all their lives. There is something very very wrong somewhere & we shall have to answer for it in one way or another, but I will not trouble you with more words of mine. Forgive me writing so much. I did not intend when I began. I should like to send the money for the book & the postage, but I do not know the price of the book. Will you kindly send me the price on a post card. Again thanking you I am Yours very Gratefully & RespectfullyAnna M. Wilkinson Anna M. Wilkinson to Walt Whitman, 21 July 1884"
