    "text": "See notes July 23 1888St. Botolph ClubBoston,3rd April, '88.Dear Walt Whitman,Thanks for note forwarded.—reached me this morning! Here in Boston I have had some queer ups-&-downs. The notorious blizzard ruined one lecture completely, but since then two have passed off with good success, & I am safe from bankruptcy,—glad to be able to get off with a whole skin to England & home. I think of leaving here for New York next Monday or Tuesday, & then taking a trip to Washington, returning via. Philadelphia for a last visit of two or three days. Spring is probably more forward with you, than up here; I hope the brighter weather is giving you good cheer,—after the long imprisonment of winter.Kennedy has not crossed my sight very recently; I hope to spend an evening with him before I leave. He went with me the other day to see the collection of Jean François Millet's paintings at Mr. Quincey Shaw's, Brookline. A grand array they make,— giving one new insight into the human environment of earth & sky & water. How paltry this life of parlours & carpets in comparison!The note from H. Gilchrist, which you sent on the other day, shows him full of work & good spirits. Of course he ends with \"Love to Walt\" as usual. Several other young fellows over there, who have written lately, have also sent greetings & love, to which adding my own, I am, as always,Yours affectionately,Ernest Rhys Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 3 April 1888"
