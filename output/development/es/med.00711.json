    "text": "Washington, D.C.,April 9, 1883.Dear Walt:Here you are! Good, too! I managed to get down to the Congressional this morning, and copied the enclosed from the Areopagitica. I think it makes a capital epigraph. It will add force to the argument to print it as I have copied it, with the full title of the treatise appended, since \"unlicensed printing\" is the subject of our story. I think you will agree that the passage fits the case also in other ways, and I hope you will like it.Winter has a characteristic dirty squib in today's Tribune anent of Doctor Bucke's book. I hope the dose I have given him in the Introductory may be appreciated by him. Goodbye. FaithfullyW.D. O'Connor[Enclosure] \"As good almost kill a man as kill a good book; who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden to the earth, but a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master-spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose, to a life beyond life. 'Tis true no age can restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great loss; but revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which all nations fare the worse. We should be wary, therefore, what persecution we raise against the living labors of public men; how we spill that seasoned life of man preserved and stored up in books, since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom.\" W. exclaimed: \"That should be carved over the door of every library, every publishing house, every public place whatsoever: children should be taught it: grown-up people should be forced to remember it: it is precious, sacred, everlasting: William was right: it fits our case, our struggles against adversity: few people know what we have had to go through to get even where we are todayâ€” which is none too far. Horace, read it again before you stick it in your pocket.\" I did so. He exclaimed \"Amen! Amen!\" when I was through. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 9 April 1883"
