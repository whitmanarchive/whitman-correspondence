    "text": "CamdenMonday P MFeb: 11, '89Quite a steady snow to-day, half melting after it falls—I have written to Kennedy—nothing to-day (to my disappointment) from Mrs: O'C[onnor]—Knortz says the German trans: (Zurich) is out—advertised there—but I have not seen any thing of it—Your MS trans: of Sarrazin rec'd, & it completes much to me—letter with it—thanks—Have you the Atlantic magazine Aug: 1887, or w'd you like a second, with the notice of Mrs: Gilchrist—in which I & mine are spoken of quite largely?—If not I will send you a copy I see I have in the rubbish—Rec'd yesterday a good warm letter f'm Addington Symonds from Switzerland (anent of Nov: Boughs, wh' he has, & dwells on)—also a photo, large, head of S. himself & very fine—Tuesday Feb: 12A short note from Rolleston, Ireland, acknowledging his \"Complete\"—He says \"I like much your one volume plan—It's a book one can walk about in, as in a great land, & see things of inexhaustible meaning & promise.\"The Chicago Morning News Feb 9 has a long review (anent of Nov. B) wh' may probably have to go in range with Sarrazin's—may even satisfy you—I will send you one—Sun shining to-day here, but the youngsters out with skates & sleds—Am thinking much of O'C—I enclose Symonds's letter—So far my \"cold in the head\" shows in a stuff'd & heavy half-dizzy feeling (nothing intense) in the said head & in occasional soreness in neck & shoulder joints.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 11–12 February 1889"
