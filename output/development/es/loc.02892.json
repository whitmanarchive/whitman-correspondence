    "text": "Belmont MassDec 2 '85My Dear Whitman—Maugre yryour wholesome advice, (exc. that I put in a page on you & Hugo—parallelism of yryour poetic-technique en-avant freshness &c) I have done gone & published my essay \"The Poet as a Craftsman.\"I set up every stick of it mesilf indade, & corrected my proofs (wh.which I'll have you know) were pronounced excellent by the other typos. You didn't know I had learned yryour boyhood's art, did you? Well, I have learned just enough to set up this & my poems (Heaven bless the mark—\"poems\" quotha,—I wd'ntwouldn't have you ever see 'em for a Scotch haggis, or a shining gold piece—). I pub.published an edition of six copies of the poems! Of this monograph I struck off 300 copies. McKay (the \"publisher\") (lucus a non) has 225. You may tell him to let you have all you want at 12½ cts; retail price 25I do hope you are feeling well, & pray fervently you may weather the winter very comfortably. How's the pony?I am going to send copies of \"Poet as CraftsCraftsman\" to Bucke, Swinburne, Tennyson, Rossetti, O'Connor, Burroughs, Dowden (what's his address?) Gilder, & O'Reilly. These of yryour personal friends I mention so you need not send duplicates. I am sick of the pamphlet by this time; but I believe in it still very thoroughly, & hope it will elicit new thoughts & better, & be a bugle-note for reform.affectionately, as everW. S. KennedyI read of the English gift of $500, with joy I send you 3 copies.from W S Kennedy | (the Poet as Craftsman) William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 2 December 1885"
