    "text": "Brooklyn, N. Y.,July 16th 1865My dear brotherWe duly received your letter—We of course all felt very indignant at the way you had been treated—but when I came to the statement that Harlan was a parson of course his conduct was to be expected  From that class you can never get anything but lying and meanness—I hope you do not allow it to have any effect on you  you must not—The poor mean-minded man—If Christ came to earth again and did'nt[didn't] behave different from what he did when he was here he would have a mighty poor show with Harlan would'nt[wouldn't] he—The most outrageous thing was published in the Eagle  If you have any curiosity abt.[about] it I will send it to you  It was perfectly in keeping with the paper and I'v[I've] no doubt was considered a very good thing by little Van—I see by the papers that the 51st will probably be mustered out in a few days  How does George feel about it I wonder—I still think if he wishes he could get in the regular army—Mother had yesterday a letter from Heyde—10 pages—of the most disgusting trash—the vilest and meanest things that he could get together  He says he shall leave Han, and go out west—I wish he was in Hell—Mother of course is considerably exercised about it—and thinks she will go on there and bring Han home—thinks she will go next week  Of course it is foolish for Mother to attempt any thing of the kind and I dont[don't] mean to let her go—I am in hopes that George will get home next week and then he could go—I am sure that Mother would never live to get there and back let alone bringing Han—I read Heydes letter through and it is plain to me that they have had a quarrel abt.[about] some women that Heyde had in his room—they had a big row and Heyde has written to mother while the thing was fresh in his cussed head—I suppose mother will get another letter soon rather taking the edge of[f] of this one—I've no doubt that Han has a most outrageous existance[existence]—and that she had better leave Heyde but I certainly dont[don't] think that Mother—old as she is can think of going there—she can hardly move in the morning till she gets some coffee with Mat—You must write her that she had better not go till George comes home and he can go with her—or something of that kind—dont[don't] fail to write mother—Everything is going as usual with me—all keep about the same  Mattie and the children are well  the baby is a little down just now—but I guess she will be all right again in a few days—My friend Davis has got back from Peru—he spent 3 or 4 days with me last week—Write to meJeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 16 July 1865"
