I am sorry the mother is sick—hope when this comes she will be all right again—I am about half-and-half, have had several little jobs of writing to do—the hot weather makes me hanker for the country—I see Horner & Burr occasionally—How is Hinieken? Good by, Ruthy dearW.W.—I had written a postal before I rec'dreceived yours postponing till Tuesday—but now I will postpone until I hear from you— Walt Whitman to Ruth Stafford, 29 April [1881]"
