    "text": "56 Euston Sq.London, N.W.17 Nov./67.My dear Sir,Allow me with the deepest reverence & true affection to thank you for the copy of your complete poems I have just received from you throthrough our excellent friend Mr. Conway—& still more for the accompanying letter to him, in which you authorize me to make, in the forthcoming London issueissue of your poems, such verbal changes as may appear to me indispensable to meet the requirements of publicity in this country & time.I feel greatly honouredhonored by your tolerance extended to me in this respect, & assureassure you that, if such a permissionpermission can in the nature of things be used rightly it shall not be abused by me.My selection was settled more than a month ago, & is now going thro'through the presspress. The only writing of yours from wh.which I thought it at all admissibleadmissable (with your consent applied for throthrough Mr. Conway) to cut anything out was the prose preface to the first Leaves of GrassGrass. As for the poems, I felt bound not to tamper with their integrity in any the slighted degree, & therefore any of them which appeared to contain matter startling to the length of British ears have been entirely excluded. But now, after your letter it seems to me that all or most of these poems, with some minimum of verbal modification or excision, may very properly be included: & indeed that there is nothing to prevent a reprint of the revised copy of your complete poems (wh.which you sent to Mr. Conway) coming out at once, instead of the mere selection—subject only to modification or excision here & there as above named. Of course I wd.would explain in print that the responsibility of this shabby job belongs to me—fortified only by your abstaining from prohibiting it; for such a prohibition wd.would be sacred to me.I have just written in this sense to the publisher Mr. Hotten. I cannot clearly anticipate whether or not he will be disposed thus to sacrifice his outlay hitherto on the selection, & embark at once on the complete edition. If he does, it will please me all the better. I shall always hold it one of the truest & most prized distinctions of my writing career to be associatedassociated, in however modest a capacity, with the works of so great a poet & noble-hearted a man as you. The time is fast coming, here as elsewhere, when to be one of your enthusiastic admirers will only be to be one of the many. I shall remember with a degree of self-congratulation that in 1855 I was one of the few.Dear Sir believe me most respectfully & truly yours,W. M. RossettiRossetti William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 17 November 1867"
