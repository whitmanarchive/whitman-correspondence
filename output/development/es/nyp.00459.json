My L of G plates having been sent on there from Rand & Avery's, Boston—& I shall begin on \"Specimen Days\" there in about a week—I havn'thaven't emerged from the house to-day, (it is July heat, oppressive)—but I shouldn't wonder if the L of G. officially ordered to pass unmolested through the mails was itemized generally over the land everywhere to-day, as the Telegraphic Associated Press chargé here in PhilaPhiladelphia told me yesterday afternoon he intended to send it generally—the Phila:Philadelphia Press here is very friendly—it has three short pieces in to-day, a first-rate acc'taccount of the P O Dept. decision & commending it editorially—Talcott Williams on the P[ress] is an ardent friend—William, I wish you would get an authentic copy of the P.
