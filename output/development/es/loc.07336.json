    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,25 Jan 1890I have yours of 22d. I am glad you are coming round to the Hospital scheme. It is (of all others) the scheme for you. You may live for years, you cannot get much (if any) stronger and may get much more helpless. In a good hospital you would be surrounded by absolutely capable attendants (doctors and nurses) and whatever happened you would be properly cared for and made as comfortable as skill and science could make you. I know your powers of endurance, they are (like the rest of your faculties) out of the line of ordinary. But what use to tax them unnecessarily? I believe with care and skill properly directed you might evenyet have many a good week and month while I fear as at present situated you have mighty few. I will make enquiry about Johns Hopkins (that is a palace of medical skill and physical comfort for the sick and helpless) Baltimore and let you know. If a change is decided on I shall go on and see you moved and settled. Don't forget to send me the \"poemet\". Where is Symonds letter? I should like much to see Steads \"Review of Reviews\" please send it. I think you are right not to trouble about the money (income) matter. If money is needed it will be found.We are better hereâ€”La Grippe is \"letting up\" on us and things are beginning to resume their old courseI send my love to youR. M. Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 January 1890"
