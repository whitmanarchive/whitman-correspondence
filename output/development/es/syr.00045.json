    "text": "[London, Ont.,]26 March [188]9The two post cards (re Mrs Costelloe and O'C.) are this moment to hand. We absolutely must not look for any but the worst kind of news from poor O'C. the only consolation in the case is that /he/ does not suffer, at least not much. Some day (quite likely soon) he will have a series of fits that will end his life. It is bad, infernally bad, but we must stand it. [â€”] I am not well pleased that Mrs. C. has another girl, I hoped she would have a boy this time. Mrs & Mr Smith will be disappointed. C. himself is I suppose too busy to think much about these little matters. Nothing new here, weather colder but still bright and pleasant. I am still hard at it trying to get things straightened outAffectionately YoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 26 March [188]9"
