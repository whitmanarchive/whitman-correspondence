(TRADE MARK COPYRIGHTED.)JanJanuary 25 1882Dear Walt:I wrote to Osgood and asked him how Leaves of Grass was selling and he rejoices my heart by saying, \"It has had a fair success so far, we have printed three editions, 2000 copies in all and it is selling steadily. It is not a \"boom\" nor can it be regarded as likely to produce any very large results to author or publisher, at the same time it seems likely to be the source of a steady though moderate income.\"JmsJames R. Osgood\"I call that splendid. 2000 copies and four months not gone! Have you seen last Sunday's N.Y. Times—2½ columns headed \"Whitman Poet and Seer\" if you have not I will send you one.We are all well.Sincerely YrsYoursJ.H. Johnstonfrom J H Johnston (to Osgood) Jan '82 John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 25 January 1882"
