    "text": "1015 O St.Washington D.C.Aug. 2d 1887.Dear Walt,William is on his way to Bar Harbor, Maine, care Dr. Kinnear, Wall's cottage. Wm.William was disposed to try Dr. K. as soon as he heard of his method, which is Dr. Chapman's, with which Wm.William was familiar, applications of heat & cold to the spine. Probably Wm.William wrote you, he said he should, when he read your letter to me. The Ashtons were very anxious to have him try Dr. Kinnear, & William feels that he oughtâ€”to try any one who gives him reasonable assurance of help. He says he wants \"either his legs, or wings,\" as locomotion of some sort is desirable. I write at this moment to ask you to please not tell any one where Wm.William is, I mean not any one who will speak of it, he asked me to caution all the friends; above all he says don't let it get into the papers, for already some vile creatures are grumbling at his vacation; so you will kindly bear it in mind. Mr. Kimball thought he better not let it be known. He (W.) said he should make Dr. K. tell him at once whether he could help him. He shows a deal of energy in starting off as he does, & as to his courage it is simply sublime, & he puts all my theoretical trust to shame by his practical application of it. A friend here offered to go all the way to Bar Harbor with him, but he said it was all \"nonsense\", that he found plenty of people ready to jump to help him, his crutch is very appealing, & now he uses that & his cane both. At any rate, he is out of this awful heat & sultriness. I hope you keep up under it. To-day it is raining here, for the first time. Dear Walt, the other day I found a package of letters belonging to you carefully put away, the Rossetti correspondence, & as a part of history valuable, & I return them to you to-day by this mail, but in another & large envelope. Let me hear from you soon if you get them safely. I send all but had to separate the bundle, as it was too thick for my envelope. With all good wishes, as ever, Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 2 August 1887"
