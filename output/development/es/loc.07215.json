    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON, ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,22 July 1888Your welcome postcard of 19th came to hand yesterday. You seem to be still \"among the midling[middling].\" I wish I could hear of you rallying a little more. The book (I have proofs to p. 92) seems to rather hang fire. I wish you wdwould hand over the balance of the M.S. to Traubel to do the best he could with it. It is not good for you to be trying at it and failing—you ought to let it go and forget it as soon as possible. In your present state you would not do any good with the Hicks if you did go through it. Let Traubel have it and tell him to alter nothing except where necessary to make sense and connection, and let it be printed and the book brought to an end. We are having warm rainy weather here, all crops look well. We are having a splendid year. Just now raspberries and currants are plentiful with us. We had our first new potatoes out of our garden today (Your potatoes are old before this). In a few minutes I am going out to Catholic Chapel—(we had protestant service this morning). There is nothing narrow about us here, we have all kinds of clergymen and services turn about. We are all well, I am keeping first-rate. You seem to have had a cool summer so far—I hope it may keep on soYour friendRM BuckeW.W. gave these to me July 25 1888 & advised that I retain them Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 July 1888"
