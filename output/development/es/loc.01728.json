It is splendidly strong and sustained and full of a noble motive. I am especially glad to learn, in such an authoritative way, of your health and vigor.I wish you would take the trouble to let me know when your volume of collected works is to be published and where I can subscribe for it. I have heard that it was to be published by subscription, but have not heard any further details.My address is now 506 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, and I would be very much obliged if you would spend a moment in letting me know how to get an early copy of the book for which many are looking.Yours faithfullyJohn HayJuly 25 '76Letter from John Hay(Custer poem) slips & paper sent him July 25 John Hay to Walt Whitman, 25 July 1876"
