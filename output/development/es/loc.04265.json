    "text": "Girls Grammar School.MaryboroughQueensland Australia.Sir,You have had, I do not doubt, many a letter of warm appreciation from people of eminent talent, but I am only what I think in America you call a \"school ma'am\" and of no \"eminence,\" but I expect its the average intellect you most want to touch as they form the bulk of the living beings. I have only had the pleasure so far of reading two of your books \"Specimen Days\" and \"Leaves of Grass\" They are both moral tonics in their joyous healthiness and seem to me just the antidote that is needed to all the morbid self analysis and sickly sentimentality of the present age. I never read them without feeling more strongly than ever what a beautiful, sane thing human life is. I wish, as I am a woman, you had told us more of your views about us, I wonder what your ideal of woman is. I should not have ventured to write to you only I see you are \"alone\" and that is a word whwhich always touches me specially now, when as an English Teacher in a new land I am without one friend with me.A thousand thanks my dear Walt Whitman for all you have written, I shall always be your debtor.Jessie E. TaylorS. N. Oct. 8, 1888. Jessie E. Taylor to Walt Whitman, [7 August] 1888"
