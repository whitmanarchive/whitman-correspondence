    "text": "Saturday afternoon March 29 ¼ to 3. Dear mother,I have come over this afternoon to the office, & am now writing this at my desk. I did not succeed in working any—was not well enough the past week—although I have not gone behindhand—but as I sit here this afternoon, it appears to me I shall be able to make a commencement next Monday—for, though feeble, I feel just now more like work than any time yet—We have had real blowy March weather here to–day, sudden & fitful showers & heavy clouds & wind—& now it is quite clear and pleasant—I cannot walk around yet but feel in good spirits—am pleased to feel as well as I do, & get along as well as I do—Mother, I do not show my sickness in my looks, in flesh or face, except very little perhaps—I will finish to–morrow or next day—Sunday night—8 o'clock—I still feel as well as yesterday, & have been out twice to–day, riding in the cars, & walking a little—I get in the cars right at my door, & am brought back there again—It has been a beautiful day—I am now sitting in my room, by the stove, but there is hardly need of a fire—Peter Doyle is here for a couple of hours—he is reading—the doctor has been in to–day—he says I am getting along very well—Monday afternoon 1 o'clock Mother, I am over at my desk in the office again, writing this. I have rec'd your letter that the money come safe. I have just written a letter to Jeff, & enclosed Josephine's & yours in it—I am feeling on the gain—but still very slowly. I am taking some medicine, to restore strength—yesterday was perhaps my best day—though I feel middling to-day—I have not sent the Graphics containing my pieces as I have not had but one copy, & sometimes not that—I send papers to–day—Mother, you write me what envelopes you want directed to any of them, & I will send them—It is gusty here but quite pleasant—I am feeling quite comfortable, & shall soon be walking around I feel confident—I want to come on to Camden, but wish to get a little more able to move around first—Love to you & all, Mother dear,Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 29–[30] March [1873]"
