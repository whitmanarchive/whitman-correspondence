    "text": "Attorney General's OfficeWashingtonNov. 30, 1868. Dear Mr. Emerson:On the eve of sending the enclosed piece abroad, I have taken a notion to first offer it to the Atlantic—and, if not too great a liberty, to solicit your services for that purpose. I would be much obliged if you would take it in to Mr. Fields the first time you go to Boston—show him this letter—If available at all, I propose it for about the February number of the magazine. The price is $100, & 30 copies of the number in which it may be printed—and I will ask Mr. Fields to do me the favor to send me an answer within a week from the time he receives the piece—or perhaps he can give his decision at once on receiving it.With best respect & love,Walt Whitman.The piece appears in printed form because I have had it put in type for my own convenience, and to insure greater correctness—I forgot to say, above, that I scrupulously reserve the right to print this piece in future in my book—(which, however, will not be for several months.) W. W. Walt Whitman to Ralph Waldo Emerson, 30 November 1868"
