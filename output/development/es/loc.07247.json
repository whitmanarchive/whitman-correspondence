    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,24 Sept 1888We are having a devil of a time so don't be uneasy if my letters shdshould seem a little \"off the center.\" Our Western Fair has begun in London and the Asylum is full from morning to night of people to see friends and people to see through the institution—it is a perfect babel. Office half full all the time of men and women asking after friends (patients in asylum) whether they are better? Are they going to get better? What was the cause of their insanity? &c &c &c. Meanwhile I ought to be writing my annual report—the meter too is likely to call on me for some attention before the week is out, besides other matters, so you see I am not likely to get dull for want of some occupation. The weather keeps lovely and all is well with us. I still hope to see you between the middle and end of Oct.I hope you are having pleasant weather and that all is going well with the books—I hope to see a copy of \"November Boughs\" this week and one of the \"Complete Works\" in the course of next week.Love to you alwaysYour friendRM BuckeSee notes Sept 27, '88. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1888"
