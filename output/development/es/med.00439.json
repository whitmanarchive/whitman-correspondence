    "text": "My dear Walt Whitman(Somehow the Mr does not come well before Walt Whitman). I am glad to hear from you again & to learn that at any rate you are no worse than when you last wrote, & that though your health be shattered your good spirits flourish up like a plant from broken ground, glad also that you find something to approve of in a work so utterly unlike your own as my Queen Mary.I am this morning starting with my wife & Sons on a tour to the Continent. She has been very unwell for two years, obliged always to lie down & incapable of any work in consequence of overworkâ€”the case of so many in this age, yours among others & we are now going into a land of fuller sunshine in hopes that it may benefit her. I am in an extreme hurry, packing up & after these few words must bid you goodbye, not without expressing my hope however that you will ultimately recover all your pristine vigor. I shall be charmed to receive your book.Ever yoursA. Tennyson Alfred, Lord Tennyson to Walt Whitman, [11 August 1875]"
