    "text": "Concord Mass.July 21 1880My dear Sir:I have long been waiting for an opportunity to invite you to my house here, under circumstances which would be agreeable to you, and now the time seems to have come. We have here this summer a school of philosophy which has drawn hither many thoughtful persons, and furnishes an occasion for saying many good things. I mailed you the programmeprogram some days ago, and now write to invite you to come to my house for a week or two after the 26th when some friends who are visiting me will take their leave. I am in a new house where I can give you freedom and some degree of comfort, and shall esteem it a favor if you will make it your home for a time.The newspapers report you as ill in Canada. I hope this is not so, and that you may be well enough to make the journey hither; while here you may rest or be active as you may choose.Very truly yoursF. B. SanbornWalt Whitman EsqEsquire, at Dr R. M. Buck'sBucke's London,Ontario. Franklin B. Sanborn to Walt Whitman, 21 July 1880"
