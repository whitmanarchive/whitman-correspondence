    "text": "Camden New JerseyMarch 23 '82Dear SirsYours of 21st rec'dreceived, with the curious list—I suppose of course from the District Attorney's office—of \"suggestions\" lines and pages and pieces &c. to be \"expunged.\" The list whole & several is rejected by me, & will not be thought of under any circumstances.To give you a definitive idea of what I meant in my notes of March 8 and March 19—& of course stick to—I mail you with this a copy of L. of G. with the not numerous but fully effective changes and cancellations I thought of making: see in it pages 848889& 90All those lines & passages marked in pencil to come out, & their places to be exactly filled with other matter—so that they will superficially present the same appearance as now. The whole thing would not involve an expense of more than from 5 to $10—My proposition is that we at once make the revision here indicated, & go on with the regular issue of the book—If then any further move is made by the District Attorney & his backers—as of course there are others behind it all—they will only burn their own fingers, & very badly—I want the paper copy I send of L of G. returned to me when through.Walt WhitmanLet this whole matter be kept quiet in the house—no talk or information that may lead to newspaper items—the change to be just silently made—the book, & at casual view all its pages, to look just the same—only those minutely looking detecting the difference—Inform the official people at once that the cancellation is to be made for future editions.W WWrite me at once & definitively if all this suits— Walt Whitman to James R. Osgood & Company, 23 March 1882"
