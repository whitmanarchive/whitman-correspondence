    "text": "54, Manchester Road,BoltonEnglandJan 6th '91My best thanks to you, my dear, good old friend for your most welcome p.c. of Dec. 23rd from which I was more than glad to learn that you were then in impr health. I have also received good letter from Horace Traubel (written on Xmas day) in which he says that Christmas Eve found you in notably good trim & relieved from many of your discomforts of the past few months. This is indeed good news for me, for Mr Wallace & for all your friends here who join me most heartily in congratulating you upon the improvement & in the earnest hope that it may continueI have given kind message & they send you their love & best wishes.Mr. Wallace has kindly sent me a copy of your p.c. to him. Thanks to you, too, for your kindness in sending the book to F.W. I have not yet seen him.We have had two magnificent days here, thin frost, bright sun shine, blue skies, a slight fall of snow last night following a really fine sunset; luminous starlight nights. I have been longing for a vigorous tramp over the hills & fells, to taste the \"caller air\" & to enjoy the rural delights I love so well. But alas! I am chained to the town by inexorable duty—which you help me to do more than I can tell you—and sick folks are numerous at this time of the year. But my work has its compensations obably, nay, certainly, heightens myenjoyment & appreciation of the beauty, the mystery & somewhat of the meaning of the shards of External Nature which you have opened my eyes to see.Yesterday afternoon I had a walk through our Bolton Park where, save for the flute like notes of a solitary blackbird and the cheery chirrups of a few sparrows, an ominous silence prevailed in the blackened leafless trees; & I fear that the six weeks' frost & snow have been fatal to a great many of our woodland songsters.This afternoon I had an hour's skating & very exhilirating[exhilarating] was it to glide over the ice upon which the setting sun was gleaming, & reddening the faces of the skaters.Jany 7thThis morning there was a dense fog & Jack Frost had ornamented our windows with his inimitably beautiful pr& hung our hedges & trees with his white rime, transforming them into silver filagree work. The afternoon was beautifully fine & sunny & this evening the children's party I mentioned in a previous letter comes off. About 50 prettily dressed little boys & girls have just had \"high tea\", to which they have done ample justice, & the general jollification & juvenile revelry are now at their height. There are games, romps, dances, bon bons, crackers, Magic Lanterns, & mirthful fun of all sorts in which I have been participating & what is better, enjoying as much as the youngest of them.Oh that you could come & join our merry throng, as \"the Carpenter\" came to old Elkanah Dyzer's place & see the gladsome \"gales of glee\" that sweep around that room. hear there echoing peals of laughter& see the joyous faces of those happy hearted children from whom I have just escaped in order to finish this letter to you as the mail goes tonight.With kindest regards to all the members of your household & with best heart love to yourselfI remainYours affectionatelyJ Johnston Dr. John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 6-7 January 1891"
