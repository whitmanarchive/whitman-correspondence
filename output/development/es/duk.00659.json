Mother, I suppose you got the letter last Wednesday, I sent—I have written a few words to Han. continues very hot here, and is now dry again—nothing new with me—I am sitting in the office, writing this, Thursday afternoon—I keep quiet as possible—for if one stirs two steps, the sweat runs off him—It is 3 o'clock—there is a little air stirring to-day, but out doors it is like an over—John Burroughs has just been in to see me—he comes in most every day—Mother, I hope you will not get affected by the heat—By accounts it must be worse in New York than anywhere else—Friday noon, Aug. 23.Mother, I just rec'd your letter—I hope by the time you get this, you will get the things—I want to come—perhaps about the 31st—(but if you all are not to rights I will put it off another week.)When you write again tell me whether Ed has recovered his spirits—Mother, it is always disagreeable to make a great change, & especially for old folks, but a little time gets things working smoothly, & then one is glad of the change, & better off—I am feeling quite well to-day—the weather is pleasanter—had a good sleep last night—I think Grant stock is steadily going up, & Greeley stock down, here & every where—Love to you, mama dear, & to Lou & all,Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 22–23 August [1872]"
