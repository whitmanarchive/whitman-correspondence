    "text": "To R. Pearsall SmithCamdennoonMay 7 '88Dear friendI wish I could send you something more medicatious than real sympathy & sorrow for your suffering & confinement—but that heartily for want of anything better. I rec'd a note from Mary with programme of her intended lecture before London women. Rec'd a letter from Logan ab't his visit to H Gilchrist's WW Portrait blow—I am not much different here (but the net is slowly winding & tightening round me)—was out driving yesterday afternoon & to supper at my friends Lawyer & Mrs. Harned's—I have been reading Boswell's Johnson—(what an old octopus J was!)—the oysters come—I had 3 or 4 for my breakfast—I take no other meal till ab't 5—Lady Mount Temple has sent me a present of a beautiful vest of knit stuff, wool & silk—Love to Alys—As old S J says \"Let us pray for each other.\"Walt WhitmanI see I have taken a sheet of paper with a rambling first draught of one of my Herald yawps—but n'importe— Walt Whitman to Robert Pearsall Smith, 7 May 1888"
