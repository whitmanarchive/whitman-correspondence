    "text": "OFFICEWashington and Georgetown Railroad Company537 NEW JERSEY AVENUEWashington,Oct. 5th1868Dear friendYou know how I am situated, and can make some allowance for a brief letter, I expect you will like it better so, however, for I should fail to interest you if I had plenty time. I am pleased to know that you are enjoying your leave of absence so much, may you continue to do so until you return. Your favor of 2d inst.instant to me, and papers for others were duly received, and I am requested by the recipients to return their thanks for the same. I have finished reading the \"Broadway\" you sent me, and was so well pleased with it that I expect to order the following numbers until my favorite piece (Stretton) is concluded. I am interrupted every minute, and can say, in truth, that I write \"under difficulties.\"I shall be very glad to hear from you again.Your friendHenry Hurt. Henry Hurt to Walt Whitman, 5 October 1868"
