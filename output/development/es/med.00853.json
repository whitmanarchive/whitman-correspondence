    "text": "[London, Ont.,]17 July [188]8You ask how long it takes a letter to come from you here—well your last letter (now before me) is postmarked 5 P.M. 15th (Sunday) and reaches me at 10 this A.M. [—] If your letter had been posted at 8.15 (the time you mention) I am not sure whether I should get it by the same mail here or whether prehaps it would come by afternoon mail and rea/c/h me 4. P.M. In a general way you may reckon from a day and a half to two days for a letter to pass from Camden or Philadelphia here. [—] Judging by your letter and by all accounts I think you are certainly on the mend Walt, and I hope we shall have you middling bright and lively again after a little. That would be a grand thing if we could only see it.About half of my folk are gone and going to Sarnia on a visit—Clare & Ina went yesterday, Mrs B. Willie, & Pardee go tomorrow morning. I shall have a quiet house for awhile. The weather here keeps perfect, quiet, hazy, sleepy days—You might fancy it the land of the Lotus Eaters but the devil of it is it is not—wish it was—too much work here altogether—however perhaps too much is better than not enough and as long as one is able to do it it is not right to complainYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 July [188]8"
