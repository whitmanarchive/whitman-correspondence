    "text": "12, Well RoadHampstead.September 10, 1886.My dear Walt:I felt my Book would not be complete with out at least one or two of your letters and though I have some 30 or 40 to myself & mother hardly any of them are suitable (for one reason or another) for publication. I therefore asked W M Rossetti if he (on reading my M.S.S.) could look out two of your most characteristic letters: he has kindly done so; sending me last night one written by you Dec: '77 about W.R.'s Selection, in which you speak against an expurgated editon etc: Rossetti speaks of it as \"an uncommonly good letter.\" And I indeed, think it manly and characteristic and also a letter of considerable literary interest, one that will help the readers to understand you; hence, I shall venture to print it in my Book, unless I have a letter or telegram to the contrary from you. What I wrote about Dr. B. sings discordantly in my earsâ€”but in truth I was and am angry at his cool request to hand over your letters (& mothers) to him: his injudicious literary zeal does you and every body else harm however, I will say no more on this head. My M.S. has been cast & makes 430 pages! I am very busy With love to you & friendsYours affectionatelyHerbert Harlakenden Gilchrist Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 10 September 1886"
