    "text": "2. Bridgeman StBoltonLancashireMay 17th 1886To Walt Whitman,Dear Sir, Permit me to offer a word of congratulation and well-wishing upon the attainment of your 69th birthday and to express the hope that you may be spared to see many happy returns of the 31st of May. I am prompted to take this liberty by a sense of my indebtedness to you, and I feel sure that you will not refuse the heart-given homage of one who loves you and who is proud to call you \"master.\" It is one of the desires of my life to look upon your venerable face in the flesh, and to be taken by the hand of my loving Comrade; and I am not without the hope of one day being thus honoured by him who has done so much to enrich my life and to rescue my Soul from its quagmire of Doubt and Despondency. Again wishing you many happy returns of your birthday, & with kindest regards, Remain,Yours, gratefully,John Johnston P.S. I trust your health is now quite restored. JJ John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 17 May 1886"
