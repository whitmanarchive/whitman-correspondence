Send you herewith a little Preface to \"Specimen Days\"—it might make two pages— Send me three or four slip impressions when in type—Yes, you can retain the Edgar Poe lines on p 17 as you wish—& in brief (having no doubt you will remember what I have said or suggested) I hereby empower you to make any arrangements or ways the publishing exigencies there or your own judgment require—I will probably send a short MS to be added on p 199 or p 200 to bring my diary up (or nearly up) to date—Something possibly also to the 2d Vol.—giving both books a touch (at any rate) of original identity & fulness—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Ernest Rhys, 8 March 1887"
