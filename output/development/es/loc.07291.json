I fear you are having a mighty dull time of it, dear Walt, and I wonder you keep up heart as you do. Letter from our New York patent lawyer today, all seems to be going well and I hope to be in Phild. before the middle of Feb. Hope so as I want to see you very much and if those friends of yours down there want a lecture on W.W. from me I trust to be prepared to give them a good one \"tho I say it as shouldn't.\" All quiet & well here. Regular spring day today, sun shining bright & warm, we have had no winter yetAffectionatelyR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 January 1889"
