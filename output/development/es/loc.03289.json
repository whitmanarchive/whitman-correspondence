    "text": "see notes Aug 26 & 31, '88The North American Review.30 Lafayette Place.ALLEN THORNDIKE RICE, Editor and Proprietor.New York City,Oct. 20, 1885.Dear Mr. Whitman: Enclosed please find a check for $50 for the article in the November number of the North American Review on \"Slang in America.\" This is the very highest rate that is paid for contributions, and exactly double what is paid for nine-tenths of the articles that appear in it. I trust it is satisfactory. When will you have your article on Lincoln ready? Mr. Rice is quite impatient for it. If any question of pay stands in the way won't you please state what you will ask for it, and then I shall have the matter off my mind. I wish you would answer this letter to-day, as I am about to start on a two weeks' trip to the West. Very truly yours,James RedpathWalt Whitman, Esq.Camden, New Jersey. James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 20 October 1885"
