There is one more fellow who I want to take the conceat[conceit] out of, and that is B.K. Sharp, he thinks he could do what he pleased with me but I want to show him he cannot do it. I was out Sunday night had a good time, went to church and then, come home. Cousin Lizzie was over to our house Sunday and went to Sunday school, then came home ate our suppers and then went out for a ride. I will be down to see you Saturday if nothing happens more than I know of now, will be down on the (5 ½) train, perhaps on the (2) I don't know yet for certain.The folks are all well, and my-self the same. I think of you where ever I have a moment to think, I don't get much time to think about anyone for when I am not thinking of my business I am thinking of what I am shielding, I want to try and make a man of my-self, and do what is right if I can do it. I havent seard[heard] from J I Allen yet. I will have to stop writing now for my sheatsheet is giving out and I must on to work, so good bye. write and let me know how you areEver your true and loving friendHarry Stafford Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 17 October 1877"
