    "text": "CamdenSaturday noonSept. 22 '88Still here in my big chair in the sick room yet—a coolish wave to-day, but pleasant enough—John Burroughs has been to see me, the good hearty affectionate nature-scented fellow, very welcome—he left yesterday en route to visit Johnson (Century staff) at Sea Girt, on the N J sea coast—J B lodged at Tom Harned's, & T H and Horace liked him muchly—J B is not so hardy & brown & stout as formerly—that bad fiend insomnia haunts him as of old—he thinks himself it affects his literary power, (style, even matter)—Horace told him my half-suspicion that his association with the superciliousness & sort o' vitriolic veneering of the New York literati had eat into him, but he denied & pooh-pooh'd it—attributed it to his bad health, insomnia &c—said he knew himself he could not (or did not) write with the vim of his better days—(probably makes more acc't of that by far, than really is)—I expect to get a specimen copy of November Boughs from the binder this evening—Shall not feel out of the woods & all safe, until I see the October Century, with my Army Hospital piece printed—accepted & paid for by them two years ago—as I consider myself obligated not to print from it until it has been first published by them—(But I have heard they give it—intend to—in the Oct. number)—Afternoon—Horace comes with spec[imen] of Nov: B bound for sample—it is satisfactory—looks plain, larger than expected—I give an order or two changing the lettering on cover, &c.—the picture printing gives satisfaction—In fact all will do—(\"Only think\" said the Irish girl \"what ye'd said if it was ever so worser\")—I have been expecting Alma Johnston of N Y to-day (or yesterday)—but no sign—a dear & prized friend—\"good roots\" for the meter (slang from N Y vagabonds, for favorable prophecy)—It gets cooler & I have donn'd my big blue wool overgown—as I end with love & thanks to you—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 22 September 1888"
