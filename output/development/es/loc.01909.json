    "text": "Rudolf Schmidt Feb. 28—'74Copenhagen,28 February 1874Dear Walt Whitman,Returning from Germany I found your letter of 25 Jan. waiting for me with many others. My first task was to write to you.'Democratic Vistas' has appeared in Danish translation for two weeks ago. I sent you myself one copy in loose sheets (to say those small parcels) and the editor has during my absence on the day of the appearance sent you two complete copies—one of them unpaid, that it could be sooner to reach you. In \"Illustrent Fodelandet\" (the people's illustrated magazine) for 22 Feb your likeness with a short biographical notice has been published, and the editor has sent you some copies. Of course all these parcels have gone to the Solicitor's office in Washington. I hope, that nevertheless the most of them have reached you. If not, let me know it as soon as possible, and new copies shall then be forwarded.\"Fædrelandet\" (the fatherland) brings this evening a criticism on eight columns on your book. You shall have the paper sent one of these days. \"Fædrelandet\" was during 30 years our most influential paper, the sovereign commander of opinions. At present its luster blackens and darkens. From democratic and liberal it has grown conservative and anxious. As all what is calling itself \"intellect\" in Denmark the editor does not at all understand the democratic movement among the peasantry. Your book has been as a clenched fist in the eyes of all these people. Of course the criticism testifies the fact. But the eight columns are in the eyes of the Danish public a great honour. The author of the criticism Rosenberg is a silly little fellow, who understands nothing between heaven and earth, and least of all, you.Clemens Petersen was in ten years the critic of \"Fædrelandet.\" It has been told to me, that his essay in the Atlantic Monthly has had a great \"success\" in America. I can hardly believe it. It is true. It should interest me very much to have true information on this point. My own opinion I wrote you in a letter the last summer. I hope, that you have received it. I also one time sent you a choice of Norwegian and Swedish poems in English translation, have you received it? With poor Clausen I sent you my picture. If you have not got, then mail it from his widow. It is the only one, which is resembling.The several pages which you have sent me I have duly received. But I did not think, that your illness had been so very intense, as now I hear.In Berlin I saw Bismarck. Is is worth the travel to get a glance on this so very powerfull[powerful] and so excessively beastly face. Attila called himself \"God's scourge\", Napoleon did not call himself so, but he was it. But Attila was imposing in the splendour of this barbaric greatness; of Napoleon the German H. Heine has said \"every inch a God\". A scourge like this Brandenburgian fox hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind never has been so deeply fallen!I fully understand your interest for Bjornson. He is genuine, his poetry comes from the source that is throbbing in the people's own heat. He has been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public. But he is a living test of the hidous[hideous] and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly head among the flowers of the 'pantheistic' poetry. You have in your \"vistas\" spoken proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the greatest lack of the present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack of Bjornson at the same time! Bjornson owes Denmark gratitude. He has shown it in the form of deep and bloody offences, that make every honest Danish heat burn with rage and indignation. I hope never to see this man, whom I have really loved, more. At present he is in Italy and most probably he is going to America in the spring to finish his moral putrification with dollars–gaining, handshakings and other humbug.You know too little of our relations, therefore I can tell you no more. But you will understand that I can forward no demand from you to Bjornson. But Clemens Petersen was one of his \"lovers\" and is it still. If Bjornson goes to America, he will visit Petersen. To him you can write and get said information.I have asked you at least two times how you did like Clemens Petersen; you have not replied and most probably you wont[won't] speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question no more.Hoping that these lines will find you in ameliorated state of health I amYoursRudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 28 February 1874"
