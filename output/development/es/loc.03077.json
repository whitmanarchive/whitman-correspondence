    "text": "BelmontAug 23 Sat 6½&c1890.Dear Friend:Thank you very much for yr flattering suggestion anent writing on the Dutch outflashings &c. I sh- be glad of the points fr you any time, & think they wd be the only part of value. But I agree with you as to letting one's thought drop mellow from the bough of the wind; & I must say that I have as yet but vague=shimmering ideas or sense=perceptions as to WW.'s Dutch aspects. But I shall look up Motley & Manahattan &c, when I can, & perhaps something of value may emerge.Logan Smith is a good fellow.Don't see Baxter somehow. He is a very secretive mystifying man,—is good Baxy.The women are irrupting into journalism & crowding out the men here in Boston.It seems nice to think of that good comb=honey of your'n. I have put up in glass 60 jars of currants & huckleberries & have bought today 24 cans of Golden Gate peaches (the best —delicious). I must have fruit, or I suffer much.It is raining this evening—a good aeonian drench—dreamy & misty & dim—we have a sweet young girl visiting us, fresh & pure & happy.I was quite amused to see my letter about the G.A.R. in the Camden paper—not amused I mean but willing. I never wrote anything, as Ruskin says, that all the world are not welcome to read.I tho't the most profound and suggestive thought on yr recent article was that about the need of a reconstruction of our ideas of beauty. I shall ponder that.I find they have Symonds's new vol. at the Athenaeum now, & I am going to watch for it every day until I get it, tho' mind you, I dont expect to be anything but dissatisfied and supercilious over it.affec[tionately]W.S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 23 August 1890"
