    "text": "WashingtonJuly 21, 1868.Dear Al Wise:I should have answered your welcome note before—but better late than never.I remember you very well, dear boy—and though you must now be indeed quite different from the little child I used to lift up in my arms & kiss, as I passed along the street, I hope we may yet call each other friends.In response to your letter I send—not my whole volume of Leaves of Grass–but Drum–Taps, a part of it, consisting of pieces created out of the war—several of them written in camp, hospital, or on the field.The other little volume has been published by John Burroughs, who, being a great friend of mine, views every thing relating to me & my works from an extremely partial point of view.I send the books by same mail with this—directed same address.—I send you my love, & I wish you to give my friendliest remembrances to your parents.Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to Alfred Wise, 21 July 1868"
