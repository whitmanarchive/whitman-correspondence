M. Christ: Ass: Directors refused me their Hall to address on Elias Hicks—so our friends are on their mettle here—cold spell of weather here—grip bad on me to-day side, back of neck sore & swelled—of course have written to Mrs: O'C & sent the preface—sun shining brightly out.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 24-25 September 1890"
