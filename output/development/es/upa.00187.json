    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamdenFeb: 6 noonDear HerbYours of 2nd rec'dreceived, & good to hear from you, & all—That you improve in handling & dexterity is nothing more than I expected—You have it in you I am sure—I am quite dismay'd to hear about John Burroughs's trouble—it is far more painful & serious than I thought—his last letter (Jan 13) just devotes a line to it—& I was in hopes all had passed over—Have you seen my friend Johnston the Jeweler? His store is at 150 Bowery, cor:corner Broome street—his house 1309 Fifth avenue, near 86th street—he is a splendid champagny fellow, of the American type—I met Mr Borody the Russian in Chestnut st. Mrs Barry has had a baby—Mr B. was to go to N Y, & I gave your address, to be call'd on—Harry Stafford was up to see me ten days ago—They are all going to move from the Creek (as Montgomery S[tafford] wants the farm)—They are going over to Glendale, to take the store there on the corner, opposite the church—are to move early in March—They are all well—I saw Capt. Townsend since—all well yet—Nothing new or different with me—I keep pretty well—My wrist, right arm & shoulder &c are symptomising a little, possibly for another March attack of that nerve-inflammation & rheumatism—(but I must not cry till I am hurt)—My brother & sister are well—Love to you, Herb, boy—& to your dear mother & Giddy—Walt WhitmanHerb, why don't you all get a big cheap house in Brooklyn by the month or quarter, with the privilege of keeping it for two or three years?—room enough for all hands—Percy & his if he chooses to come on—a room for me—I would come on & stay & pay a moderate board—Can't we make it pay?
