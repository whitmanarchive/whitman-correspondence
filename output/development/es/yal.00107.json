    "text": "Brooklyn, September 21, 1867. My dear friend,I suppose you saw my letter to William O'Connor, a week since, with notice of my safe arrival home, & account of one thing & another up to that date. I have called at the American News Company store. They have not sold many of the Notes—not more than a hundred. It seems to be well-known, however, & often talked about. I have procured & given Henry Clapp a copy, at his particular request. I have seen F. P. Church, who treated me with great courtesy—he was anxious about the article on Democracy—wishes to have it for the December number—said he would publish the little piece Ethiopia Commenting—but thought it best to keep it back till after the Democracy article had appeared.I have not done anything further to the latter-named piece—but shall try to have it ready in time for the December number. I think it likely I shall return last of this week to Washington. I have not received any letter at all from Washington. H. J. Raymond is home from Europe.Give my best respects to Mrs. Burroughs—as I am coming back so soon, I will mention then what I have to say on the shirt question. I am living at 1194 Atlantic st. opposite Hamilton street. There is nothing specially new or important among my folks—they all wish me to give their best regards to you.Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 21 September 1867"
