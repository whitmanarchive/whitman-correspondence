I believe I sent you a month ago a little paper with my late piece \"Riddle Song.\" The early summer is very fine here, & I am enjoying it, even heat and all—I live on the banks of the Delaware river like—I wish you could know my dear friend Mrs Gilchrist & her family, now 5 Mount Vernon, Hampstead—they were three years here in America—Best respects & love to you—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Frederick Locker-Lampson, 26 May 1880"
