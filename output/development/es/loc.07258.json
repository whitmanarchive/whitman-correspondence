    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,23 Oct 1888Your letter of 13th to Burroughs, O'Connor and myself written on the back of Mrs Costelloe's letter to you reached me last evening. Burroughs sent it to O'C. and he to me and with it the little note which I enclose. I have written a long letter to O'C. to try to cheer him up a bit, I fear he is in a bad way. That paralisisparalysis of the eyelid (Ptosis) I fear will not let up. It is an extension of the disease (sclerosis) that has troubled him so long and a disease of this kind is a good deal more in the habit of going forwards than backwards.It is still raining here (beats the Dutch how it rains) we have had hardly a fine day in a month and it looks this morning as if we shdshould never have fine weather again. It is well enough (as Longfellow says) that some days should be dark and dreary—but I don't see the fun of so much cloudy weather.I am glad you like the Photo—I have not had many printed from it yet, been waiting for bright weather to try another negative but I agree with you that the one I sent you is very good. No word yet from Wm Gurd in re meter—I shall not be able to fix the time of my going East untill[until] I hear from him (and perhaps not when I first hear from him). Yours of 21st just to hand—I have not seen any of the papers you mention, wish you or Horace wdwould send them & the Critic with your letter in when it comes out. We are all well and all goes on as usual—quiet and pleasant. Shall write again soonLove to youR M BuckeSee notes Oct 25, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 October 1888"
