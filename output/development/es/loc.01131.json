    "text": "Esopus NY.New YorkJuly 11, 78Dear Walt:I recd both your cards, also the package of Tribunes with your letter. I happened to get the Tribune on the 4th & so had seen the letter. It is re-printed in the Semi-Weekly edition also. I of course read it with deep interest. It is a noble eloquent letter & has the old stirring ring. I like it immensely.I hope you have weathered this heated term, It has been tremendous here. We got our baby just as the heat began, July 1st, & we have had our hands full. He has been quite restless & sleepless, & we were both nearly worn out. He is doing better now & we hope the worst is over. He is a bright little fellow & I expect we shall \"set a store\" by him as the old women sayThe raspberries still hang on & the currants too, but the best I can do now is to think of you when I eat them, which is three times a day. We have picked 2600 lbs of currants off that patch, & there are several hundred there yet. Smith & his family are well.The baby is lying on the lounge in my room as I write, I hear him nestle & see that his eyes are open. So I must stop.Guernsey had a pleasant paragraph about you & your Tribune letter in the Boston Herald. 'Sula sends love, so does the baby.John Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 11 July 1878"
