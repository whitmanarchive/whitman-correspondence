    "text": "No 109 North Carolina AvAtlantic CitySeptember 3d 1888My Dear Mr WhitmanFrank and I read your \"Old Age's Lambent Peaks\" yesterday afternoon as we sat together by the sea and he thought and spoke much of you as he often do.Dear Friendâ€”I wish that you could be with us to enjoy on these, to me, beautiful grey afternoons when there is no glare from the sun, few people, so that one may be almost alone on the quiet beach and have only one's thoughts and the sounding sea.I think you will be interested to know that my cousin, of whom I have made mention to you as being intimate with the Lewes household; has just returned from England where he has talked much of you. He is one of Frank's converts to the Whitman side and is now most enthusiastic and fairly raves about you.When is the new book to be out I hope it will be a great success! You will be sorry, I am sure, to hear that Churchill has had Typhoid Fever he is quite recovered however by this time and is growing very stout. I dont suppose his Father ever told you, how very well he did in College last winter. He took the \"English prize\" and in athletics he did remarkably well, being the sixth strongest man ever examined in the University. I hope no one but yourself will see this letter as I am sure it would bore anyone else to read it but knowing your love for Churchill I have not hesitated to \"brag\" a little. With love from the boys and hoping you may scrawl a line just to prove you have not forgotten Your friendMary B. H. WilliamsKind regards to Mrs. Davis. Mary B. H. Williams to Walt Whitman, 3 September 1888"
