    "text": "Anderton, near ChorleyLancashire, England16. Jany. 1891.Dear Walt Whitman,I can't write much tonight, but I want to send you a few lines by this mail.Fred Wild called to see me yesterday & had dinner with me (in Bolton). I spoke of my last letter to you, & said that if I had had a spare copy of his photo: I would have sentit to you.— So this morning, I was pleased to receive a letter from him enclosing one, which I forward herewith.He is very much pleased with his copy of L. of G., (he is an old lover of yours,) & regards its presentation from Johnston & myself as \"another token of our brotherhood,\" covenanted anew in your dear & honoured name. He hopes that the influence of the book \"maybind our hearts more firmly together in the coming years,\" & asks me, when I write to you again, \"to at least send you his warmest love & good wishes.\"— I am glad to do so at once, for I know well how sincere & deep his love & admiration for you are.He is not \"literary\" at all, though he is not without appreciation of the best literatures. He has an artist's eye for the beauties ofNature (paints a little), but prefers Nature at first hand, with its vital freshness & movement. (loves the sea especially—boating, sailing, fishing &c). He is not conventional, but rather too unconventional, & always prefers to be considered much worse than he is, rather than better. He has a wild, native wit of his own, & is frank, outspoken & free, in speech & manners—But he is liked at once by all wherever he goes. And, atthe heart of him is a deep, constant affectionateness, faithful & unswerving, & a native reverence of soul, all the deeper because so impatient of make-belief as to seem irreverent & irreligious. He has a wife & four children of whom he is fond. And I, his friend & intimate chum from boyhood, have found him stedfastly loyal & true & affectionate, through thick & thin.I wish the portrait were a better one, but suchas it is, it may serve as a message of his personal love & adhesion.I rejoice to think that natures like his respond to you so spontaneously & so warmly. You can afford to let the literary classes stand in antagonism to you (though it can be for a short time only), while the masses (the great majority,) who deal with life & nature & experience at first hand, & who despisesecond hand presentations in books & art, see in you a master, as fresh & vital as Nature itself, offering them love & faith, & vistas before unknown.I hope that you are better, & your \"health points\" more \"favourable\" than when you wrote last.With love to you alwaysI remainYours affectionatelyJ.W. Wallace James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 16 January 1891"
