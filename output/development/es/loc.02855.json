No. 416 Broome Street.Special Agents in the United States for ALEXANDER STRAHAN & Co's Publications.416 BROOME ST., New York,Dec. 28, 1867.Walt Whitman Esqr.Dear Sir,The Editor of \"The Broadway\"Mr. Edmund Routledge, London, writes desiring us us[us] to get from you, if we can, one or two papers or poems for his magazine. He was offered early sheets of your paper on Democracy from the \"Galaxy\" but that would not suit his purpose, he wants such only as he can have for both sides of the Atlantic and is willing to pay accordingly. We do not suggest the title of any subject, believing you to know best the subjects on which you would like to write for such a magazine. Lest you may not know the magazine we send you by mail a copy of each of the five numbers already published. No 6 will contain papers by Francis Turner Palgrave and Henry Sedley Editor of the Round Table and a long poem by WmWilliam M. Rossetti.Hoping to have a favorable reply from you on an early dayWe remainYours respectfullyfrom G. Routledge & Sons.Jas.James Barris George Routledge & Sons to Walt Whitman, 28 December 1867"
