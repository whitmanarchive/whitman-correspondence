    "text": "Head Quarters  Prince St. Military Prison Alexandria Va.  May 8th 1865 Dear MotherI arrived here and joined the Regiment about ten days ago and was placed in command of this Prison.I am very well, indeed but have plenty to do as I have about 300 Prisoners (mostly thieves, Bounty jumpers and Deserters) to look after. I have 100 of the men of our Regt. and 5 Officers here with me guarding the Prisoners.There is about 20 Rebel officers here (Paroled Prisoners) but they are used very different from what we were, when we were in Rebeldom.I saw Walt when I came through Washington, and I hear he was over to see me yesterday but did not find me. Well Mammy the war seems to be over, and I think the most of us will soon be sent home. It is now getting late (after Eleven O clock at night) and as I feel rather tired I will go through the Prison and see that all is right and then turn in. I sleep here in the building (I have a very good room) and take my meals at a Boarding house  I pay 6 dollars per week for grub but dont[don't] live any of the best.Good night to allDirect Capt G. W. Whitman Comdng Prince St Military Prison  Alexandria Va George Washington Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 8 May 1865"
