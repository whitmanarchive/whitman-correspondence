    "text": "112 M St. N. W.Oct. 5th, 1890.Sunday A. M.Dear Walt,Your letter of Sept. 29, enclosing two more slips of the Preface came duly, but now that I am in office, & have to leave at 8 A. M. & don't get home till near or quite 5 P. M. I am so tired that I can't even touch a pen at night. I am in for two months, as the Census work is closing up in part. It has been a hard & busy summer, & that is why you did not hear from me. I had to work just as hard for the examination for this office, as for any, & had to pass an examination, & then work to get in.So now with my moving, &house-keeping, & getting through with a day in the office, you can say that I am busy. Thank you again for the Preface. I am pleased with it, for I know you wrote what you felt to write. I know that you & I feel more & more a most tender & growing love for dear William, & all his noble & generous qualities show out to me by contrast, all the time. I don't find others like him, tho' I have nothing to complain of; & have warm & loyal friends.I have a vivid picture of you, as you sit in your room. I Hope we shall have fine weather, & that you will enjoy it.My sister Jeanine, Mrs. Channing, will be here before the month ends, I hope.With thanks again—& love—As ever—Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 5 October 1890"
