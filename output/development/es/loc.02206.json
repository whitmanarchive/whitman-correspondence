(should the Review not be out when you get this) you can send to Mr Rice, the editor, or Mr Metcalf the business manager, & I think get the sheets—you can use my name—Walt WhitmanShould you notice, send to meIn my last I addressed you at 757 Broadway—is either that, or the address to this letter, all right?—Send me word more definitely about the Critic & mind the proof—send it in a letter, letter postage—& it will be returned same night——I am feeling real well for me this winterWW Walt Whitman to Jeannette L.
