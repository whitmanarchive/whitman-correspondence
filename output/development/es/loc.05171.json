    "text": "211 Tremont Street.Boston,Nov. 14 1881.Dear Mr. Whitman:The book starts well and is already receiving the correct mingling of voices in the chorus that is arising over it.I want to ask, if you could, by way of a latter day benefaction to some survivors of the army that you devoted your labors of love to nearly twenty years ago—let me have some little thing for the paper to be published during the Fair of which I enclose a circular?It's a noble object to get the remaining poor fellows out of the almshouses and into a home of their own. I am doing what little I can & among other things, helping to get contributions for \"The Sword and the Pen,\"—so the paper is to be called.If you can help me, it will please me much and aid the cause more.With best regardsVery Truly Yours:B. H. TicknorWalt Whitman EsqPS. The first edition is all gone & we are binding up the second. Benjamin Ticknor to Walt Whitman, 14 November 1881"
