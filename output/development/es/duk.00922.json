I rec'd your letter—Wilson then is the pub[lisher] y'r book—If you think well of it, express the whole MS. first, to me here, that I may look over & authenticate—Put it in stout pasteboards, tie well, & direct fully & carefully, & it will easily travel & the expense will not be great—W W Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 10 January 1888"
