    "text": "May 29, 1890.Dear Walt,I am going to ask you to do something for me,—or shall I say something for William,—it will be for us both.It is this—will you write a prefatory notice, a memoir, or whatever it may be, as brief or long as you will, for a volume of his stories that I want to collect + publish with the new one that has not yet been printed, \"The Brazen Android;\"—As soon as William passed away his friends began to say that I ought to collect + reprint his stories,—but only now has it taken any shape,—& now I think I see the way to do it, to put the seven into one volume, and I am sure that any publisher will take it for me, if only it has your word of preface. It will I know make the volume sell; & it will be a great thing for me.Any data that you may want I shall be very glad to furnish you.I feel a great hope rise up in me at this idea, dear Walt, & hope that you can & will do it. With love & congratulations on your coming birth-day, as ever—the sameNelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 29 May 1890"
