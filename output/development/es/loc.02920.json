    "text": "Frid. '88Dear W.W.Dr. Bucke tells me that the list of names he sent me was yryour own listâ€”up to 1880. If you know any intelligent young fellow who wants to earn a dollar, or $1.50, by copying from yryour book (if you have such) or yryour record (if you have such) the names you may have kept since that time. I shdshould be glad indeed to have the list. It might insure the publication of the book; for purchasers of L. of G. are of all most likely to buy my work.I see that Howells has in the \"Ed. Study\" of Feb. Harper's Monthly some colorless & diplomatically drawing-roomish talk on you & Tolstoi. Pretty good though, & worth yryour reading. H. is never profound, methinks; but is graceful & happy. comradely yrsyoursW.S. KennedyHow is yryour health? I fear you are \"loguey.\" William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1888"
