    "text": "CamdenEvn'g March 26 '88I return Mr Johnson's letter—I do not see any thing in it more than facts or appearances warrant—as he is & as things are down there poor J is in a bad, unhappy fix—as of coffee being ground in a mill—Much relieved to know you will yourself see all the proofs of the Wilson book—give them a good searching reading—for with Dr Bucke's book they are to be in all probability the vignette & authority of many things in my & my works' future—the backward & contemporary reference. Nothing new in particular with me—more or less evidences of gradual physical deterioration—but spirits good—appetite &c fair—& you know I begin my 70th year now in ab't two months—thank God indeed that things are as well as they are & that I & my fortunes (literary & otherwise) are—Rainy & dark & raw here all day—I was out yesterday four hours to my friends the Harneds—was taken & bro't back in my phæton—a lull in my Herald contributions—I send you the Kottabos from Dublin—Morse is still out in Indiana—Dr B kindly writes to me often & you must do so too.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 26 March 1888"
