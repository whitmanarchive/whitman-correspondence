    "text": "[London, Ont.,]23 March [188]9Yours of 21st just to hand with card from Mrs O'Connor. The latter is gloomy, indeed we must not expect much good news from that quarter, I had a note from O'C's Dr, Dr Hood, which I enclose, it shows a bad state of things. O'C. may go on a long time but that is hardly to be expected or desired—we much make up our minds to his death or worse—for should he live much longer his life would necessarily become a burden to himself and others. I do not like to write this way but I think you ought to know my candid opinion. The case was bad enough before the development of the epeleptoid attacks [/] now it is simply desperate. That is as far as we can see—beyond and outside of that is another story and I have no doubt (as you have so well taught) that all is well provided for and is as it should be. We must have faith and keep cool whatever comes or goes.The weather here today is perfect, like Mary—warm, bright, lovely, and I am enjoying it. Yes, I have enough to do it that is a good thing (suppose it is) but I often wish (we are never content you see) for a little more freedom and leisure—but if I had them I guess I should not be a bit more satisfied.I shall be glad (very glad) to get a few copies of that McKay picture—I hope thay will make a good job of it. The 1864 picture you gave me the other day is setting up on the bookshelf at my right hand looking at me in the most friendly wayLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 March [188]9"
