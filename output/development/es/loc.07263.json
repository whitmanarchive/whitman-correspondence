    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,6 Nov 1888Yours of 3d Enclosing letters from Rhys, O'Connor, Mrs Costelloe and Logan Smith came duly to hand this morning. All were heartily welcome and at once read with pleasure. Yes I have the \"Transcript\" and this morning the \"Bulletin\" came to hand from Horace. Do not forget to send me the \"Pall Mall Gaz\" cont'g Mr Summer's piece. No doubt Ed. Wilkins is with you now, I shall be very anxious to hear what impression he makes. I heard from Wm Gurd yesterday, all is going well with him and the meter, he will probably want me down in about a week—hope there will be no hitch about getting leave of absence from asylum. There are some little matters on hand and in prospect that may make it awkward for me to be away.Yes, I do not know what we should do without Horace, the kind of help he gives could not be bought for money and without him we should be badly stuck in many ways—I have the greatest admiration for him and the magnificent way he has behaved all through—I hope it may be in my power someday to show my appreciation of his excellent qualities in some practical way.We are having some delightful weather here now—some of those quiet, dreamy autumn days that leave such a sleepy charm.I hope to see you soon, shall soon write againAlways affectionately your friendR M BuckeSee notes Nov. 8, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 November 1888"
