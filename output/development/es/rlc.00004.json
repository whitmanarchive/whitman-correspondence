    "text": "Brooklyn, New York, April 4, 1872. Mr. Rudolf Schmidt,Dear Sir & Friend,Your magazine with the article on my book has safely reached me—& a second copy in sheets—also your last letter. I only write now to make prompt, brief acknowledgment. I have gleaned a general knowledge of the article, & it pleases me very much. I have seen Clemens Petersen in New York, & he ran over it for me. He has been very ill with erysipelas, but is now nearly well.I am to return to Washington in two or three days. I will write to you thence more fully, & hope to continue having letters from you—My address will be Solicitor's Office, Treasury.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 4 April 1872"
