    "text": "1015 O St.June 1st 1890.Dear Walt,A postal card from Dr. Bucke yesterday tells me that you will write the preface for me to the volume of William's stories. I can't tell you how glad I am! It is of all things just what I would wish.The stories were all but \"The Carpenter\" written before you knew him, when he was very young, but some of them show great maturity in spiritual insight. \"The Ghost\" is my favorite, & I have read it dozens of times,—& some parts of it even yet I never can read without tears,—it is a noble & sweet lesson. They are mostly Christmas stories. \"The Brazen Android\" has never been in type, save a part of it which the publishers had put into the printer's hands when William recalled it, & sent back the money they had sent him, on it. I tell you all this, as you may not remember. His friends have been urging me to collect & have the stories made into a volume, with a sketch, or a little biography, or something,—but I have been unable to see how or what to do, till the idea to have you write this for me came like an inspiration! I saw at once that it was just the thing, & would give the book just what it needs. Your name & William's will be in many ways, & this loving word from you will be a comfort to me for all time. Any facts or any thing that you may want, ask for, I shall only be too happy to give.The book will have a sale, I know, if you write the preface.You will think & brood over it, & the right thought will come I am sure. The stories with the new one, will be seven in number.I hope you are feeling well this perfect June 1st day.With love—Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 1 June 1890"
