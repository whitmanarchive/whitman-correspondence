    "text": "WashingtonApril 30, 1868. Messrs. W. C. & F. P. Church.My friends:I have now just ready an article intended as the third & concluding one to the two already published by you, on \"Democracy\" and \"Personalism.\" This is upon the general subject of a needed American Literature, in the highest sense, & of our imaginative, mental, &c. growths, home-born, appropriate to & towering high enough for, The States, & faithfully in the interests of their Democratic institutions. I have, of course, treated the subject in my own way—certain parts strong & earnest—but there is nothing in it to make the piece at all improper for the magazine—probably indeed may be found more appropriate & serviceable—more to rouse editorial & critical remark, &c—than the already published articles. I propose to you to print it in the Galaxy for July. It will make from eleven to twelve pages in your new form & type. The name is Orbic Literature. The price, if satisfactory, will be the same as for each of the previous articles, viz: $100. I reserve the right of printing it in future book. I can send it on immediately.I think it will be best not to delay too long, as the interest in the thing is now up, something like a serial story. This is the conclusion, & I should like to have it in July number. Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to William C. Church and Francis P. Church, 30 April 1868"
