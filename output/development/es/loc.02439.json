    "text": "54 Manchester RoadBoltonLancashire.EnglandAug 27th 1890Dear Walt Whitman,Last evening Mr Wallace shewed me your post card, from which I was extremely sorry to learn that you had been a little uneasy about me. By this time you will know from his cablegram and from our letters that all is well with me but I regret that I did not write to you sooner or cable to you immediately upon my arrival, through not doing so I feel I have been guilty of a seeming lack of courtesy to you. You will need no assurance that this has not been intentional on my part; for I can never forget your great kindness to me—the homely, cordial + sponteneous reception you gave me not only to your house but into your heart which you seemed fairly to open to me in a way that has touched me very deeply indeed.By your loving kindness, your sympathy and your open-handed generosity you have enriched my life with treasures which I would not exchange for all the wealth of Golconda for you have given me \"yourself\" as \"a living impulse\"\"We convince by our presence.\" Your presence has haunted me ever since I left you and at times the sense of propinquity is so strong that I find it difficult to realize that we are separated by more than three thousand miles!\"What is it then between us? Whatever it is it avails not,—distance avails not, and place avails not.\"The words of Mr Wallace that I seem to have had a spiritual are no exaggeration for I am conscious of having received a something from you which has infused itself into my being and which eludes my senses and baffles my judgment to explain.And now you crown your goodness by shewing such a sympathetic concern about my welfare as no other man save my own, dear, good father could have done.For all this and more I desire you to accept of my heartfelt thanks.I am glad to hear that your health is fairly good + I trust it may continue to improve now that the intensly hot weather has gone.I am taking the liberty of writing to Dr Bucke to explain my not visiting him as I intended. It was simply impossible for me to do so + deeply do I now regret it.I hope Warren has received the book on \"massage.\"I send you a few photographs—the first I have done + hope you will like them.With kindest regards to Mrs Davis + Warren + love to yourselfYours affectionatelyJ. Johnstonto Walt WhitmanCamden John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 27 August 1890"
