    "text": "BrooklynAug. 2.Dear friend,I write a line just to give an account of myself. I am well as usual, & in good spirits. My Mother, brother George, & all, are well. I came through finely on the RR. last Wednesday—& found myself received very agreebly just as I crossed Jersey flats, approaching New York, by an entire change in the weather—the distressing heat gone—& in its place summer atmosphere, of course, but moderate enough—which has continued every day since. I enjoy it all, home here, day & night—especially the nights—which are fine. I hear that Wm Swinton is here, from California. Your name was just mentioned on the editorial page of last Saturday's (I believe Saturday's) Tribune. I have seen Mrs. Price, she is ill with asthma. Her daughter Emily has had a fine little baby boy, now about a month resident in this mad world—(I write about the baby for Nelly and Jenny)—My sister Martha & the children have migrated from St. Louis to St. Paul, (Iowa) for a few weeks. They are as well as usual. I am quite busy flying around—the printers & stereotypers commence on my immortal work to-morrow—My dear, dear friend, I hope you are well & in good spirits—I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge, if he is there—the package of letters & paper came promptly—& I will heartily thank you to continue watching the letters &c. and forwarding them to me in same manner—Please enclose this in your next letter to Nelly—Nelly, my darling, I hope you are having comfortable times, & that all goes well—& Jeannie too—I think often about you both—& send you my best love—in which I am joined by my Mother. Walt. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 2 August [1870]"
