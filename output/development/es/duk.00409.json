But this is quite rudely dashed by a debilitating sickness, which her physicians pronounce severe jaundice, and which the utmost care to ensure her early recovery—We brought her bed down in our best room—She is looking much emaciated, but is made more comfortable by the change. She has allways[always] rallied so effectualy[effectually] from former attacks, relying solely upon upon her hereditary constitution that I was greatly surprised and overcome—She recieved the 1 dollar—this necessiates[necessitates] the aid of a little more money—say to buy ½ ton of coal, and other necessaries, perhaps, say 5 dollars, and if George could add as much more, so much better—one doctor says she will improve in a short time, the other is not so certain. Should mail any money, I would be glad that it be addressed to the care of G. W. Beckwith, Post Master—cause, she was very nervous when she discovered that I had written to you some time ago, and this must be avoided—Kind neighbors are near her—I will inform you daily of her condition—she had just laid, or changed her carpet for the winter—C. L. Heyde. Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 19 October 1888"
