    "text": "WashingtonSept 29 1863Dear Mother,Well here I sit this forenoon in a corner by the window in Major Hapgood's office—all the Potomac & Maryland & Virginia hills in sight—writing my Tuesday letter to you, dearest mother—Major has gone home to Boston on sick leave, & only the clerk & me occupy the office & he not much of the time—at the present moment there are two wounded officers come in to get their pay, one has crutches—the other is drest[dressed] in the light blue uniform of the invalid corps—way up here in the 5th floor it is pretty hard scratching for cripples & very weak men to journey up here—often they come up here very weary & faint, & then find out they can't get their money, some red tape hitch, & the poor soldiers look so disappointed—it always makes me feel bad—Mother, we are having perfect weather here nowadays, both night & day—the nights are wonderful, for the last three nights as I have walked home from the hospital pretty late, it has seemed to me like a dream, the moon & sky ahead of any thing I ever see before—Mother, do you hear any thing from George, I wrote to him yesterday & sent him your last letter & Jeff's enclosed—I shall send him some papers to-day—I send papers quite often—(why hasn't Jeff sent me the Union with my letter in—I want much to see it, & whether they have misprinted it.)Mother, I dont[don't] think the 51st has been in any of the fighting we know of down there yet—what is to come of course nobody can tell—As to Burnside I suppose you know he is among his friends, & I think this quite important, for such the main body of East Tennesseans are, & are far truer Americans any how than the Copperheads of the North—the Tennesseans will fight for us too—Mother, you have no idea how the soldiers, sick &c. (I mean the American ones to a man) all feel about the copperheads, they never speak of them without a curse & I hear them say with an air that shows they mean it, they would shoot them sooner than they would a rebel—Mother, the troops from Meade's army are passing through here night & day, going west & so down to reinforce Rosecrans I suppose—the papers are not permitted to mention it, but it is so—two Army Corps I should think have mostly passed—they go through night & day—I hear the whistle of the locomotive screaming away any time at night when I wake up, & the rumbling of the trains—Mother dear, you must write to me soon, & so must Jeff—I thought Mat was going to send me a great long letter, I am always looking for it, I hope it will be full of every thing about family matters & doings, & how every body really is—I go to Major's box three or four times a day—I want to hear also about Andrew, & indeed about every one of you & every thing, nothing is too trifling, nothing uninteresting.O mother, who do you think I got a letter from, two or three days ago—Aunt Fanny, Ansel's mother—She sent it by a young man, a wounded soldier who has been home to Farmingdale on furlough, & lately returned—she writes a first rate letter, Quaker all over—I shall answer it—She says Mary & Ansel & all are well—I have rec'd another letter from Mrs Price, she has not good health, I am sorry for her from my heart, she is a good noble woman, no better kind—Mother, I am in the hospitals as usual—I stand it better the last three weeks than ever before—I go among the worst fevers & wounds with impunity—I go among the small pox, &c just the same—I feel to go without apprehension, & so I go—nobody else goes, & as the darkey said there at Charleston when the boat run on a flat & the reb sharpshooters were peppering them, somebody must jump in de water (& shove the boat off)—Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 29 September 1863"
