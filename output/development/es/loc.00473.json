    "text": "St. Louis May 9th 1873My dear WaltI received your letter and I do not think you can form an idea how very badly I feel to hear that you are not recovering faster. I do so sincerely hope that you are right in your theory that the slow recovery indicates permanency—I hope to God, my dear Brother that you may permanently recover—Not much new with me—I have had several outside jobs lately that will pay me I think in time but so far they are only sources of investmentHow do you get along on money matters? do not fail to let me know if you have any prospect of being short  I read with much regret mother's statement about the eating at George's,  it does seem too bad that with every chance to make things good and happy they should fail so completely on so small a cause. I hope you may carry out your idea of getting a little place in Washington and have Mother live there  It would be happiness indeed for her, and for you too for that matterI cannot understand how it is that Loo is so stingy nor how it is that George does not correct it—I would suppose he would (and naturally he is so) prevent it at onceHattie wrote you a few days ago—I hope you have it ere thisWrite me when you can and let me know if you are in want of a little moneyAffectionately Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 9 May 1873"
