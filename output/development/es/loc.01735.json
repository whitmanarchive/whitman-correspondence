    "text": "1872Brooklyn, 107 north Portland av.June 14. Dear son,I got home all right Saturday night—& have been having quite a good time. There is nothing very new—Mother is well as usual. I shall print my College Poem in a small book—it will be small—& is intended as the beginning of a larger one—I am having it set up at the printing office—will send you one in ten or twelve days. Pete, how are you getting along—I suppose on 14 the same as when I was there—I see by the papers that the head men have mostly migrated from Washington, & that it is said to be hot & dull enough there— —Do you see any thing of Mr. Tasistro? I rec'd the letter he sent to the office for me—I am writing this in the house in Portland av—we are having a showery afternoon——Good bye, my darling boy—& I will try to write again soon, (& a more interesting letter)—Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 14 June [1872]"
