Rossetti's remittance by p. o. drafts &c. duly reached me, & I have the money—(& very opportune it is.) Edward Carpenter sent me £50 lately—the affectionate noble-hearted young man—As far as I can perceive & understand your scheme is managed admirably & to my entire satisfaction & deepest gratitude. With me personally here every thing moves in pretty much the old current—not quite so well for bodily health of late & at present—yet not much different. The Staffords are well—Harry has a very fair situation (address RR Station, Marlton, New Jersey) & has a little printing office, besides his RR agency—Ruth is in Kansas, married to Wm Gouldy—Ed called here a few days ago—reported every one well—W W______________________________________________________________________ —Herbert here are some names of friends (or used to be friends) of L of G. and W.
