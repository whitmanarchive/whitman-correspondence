    "text": "46 Marlborough HillSt. John's WoodLondon N.W.16 June 1890My dear Walt Whitman,The second copy of \"November Boughs\" reached me by post this morning; and a few lines are due to you to let you know its safe arrival. It is a great pleasure to me to receive it. I did particularly want it with your writing in it, and shall always readfrom this copy and value it highly. I did not say anything of its absence from the big parcel, because I supposed there was some good reason, & knew I had much more anyway than I deserved. I shall keep the extra phototype portrait when you have placed it in the \"Sands.\"Miss Louisa Drewry,the lady whose paper I told you of in my last, called here yesterday to see the various editions of your books, and the portraits I have of you. She is a thoroughly intelligent appreciator & sees something of the magnitude of L. of G. She has carried off Mrs. Gilchrist's papers on you to read (Herbert's book).You will probably hear from her, as she fancies to get some books you distribute yourself.Yours always in affectionate respectH. Buxton Forman Harry Buxton Forman to Walt Whitman, 16 June 1890"
