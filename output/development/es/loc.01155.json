    "text": "West Park N.Y.June 28, 86Dear Walt; We returned from our wanderings last week. On the whole had a fairly good time. I had a good glimpse of a large section of the country. I spent 10 days in Washington, then went to Ky. where I stayed till 1st of June, & joined wife & Julian in Chicago June 5th. I found Wm O'Connor better than I expected to; his mind seems clear & strong, & his lameness not very bad. But there is probably little chance of his ever being any better. A sea voyage is the thing for him, but he will not go. He has probably got that horrible disease called progressive locomotor ataxia I saw him several times at his office. He felt a little insecure in his place, but I don't believe he will be disturbed. Washington was very beautiful & I was glad to be there again. My sleep was very poor while in Ky, but I think of it as the finest country I have yet seenâ€”that is the blue grass region of it; much ahead of anything I saw in Ill. or Ind. or Ohio. I went to St Louis, & sailed from there up to Quincy on the Missippi.Mississippi I was ten days in Chicago, the N.Y. of the west, & destined to be an enormous city. We stopped at Cleveland with friends, then at Niagara & at Utica. Julian saw many wonders & got many ideas. I am very glad to be home again. It is getting to be a great bore for me to gad about to see things. I hope you are better than when I saw you. You should make a determined attempt to keep your bowells open. It makes me shudder when I remember what you said about their torpidity. I could not live a month so. Your head would be all right if you could keep your bowells open. Frank Baker said that an outward movement, such as chafing & kneedingkneading of them by the hands would be a great help. Why can you not have your boy do that for 1/2 hour each day, also drink a good deal of water. Hathern[Hathorn] Spring water from Saratoga would be good. Also a wet towel over the liver. Drop me a line how you are, & if you have any plan to get away from C. for the summer. With loveJ Burroughs1886 1885 John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 28 June 1886"
