    "text": "Washington, June 12, 1869Charles W. Stoddard,Dear Sir:Your letters have reached me. I cordially accept your appreciation, & reciprocate your friendship. I do not write many letters, but like to meet people. Those tender & primitive personal relations away off there in the Pacific Islands, as described by you, touched me deeply. In answer to your request, I send you my pictureâ€”it was taken three months since. I also send a newspaper. Farewell, my friend. I sincerely thank you, & hope some day to meet you. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Charles Warren Stoddard, 12 June 1869"
