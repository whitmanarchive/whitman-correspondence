    "text": "Brooklyn, August 23, 1869. Dear William O'Connor:I was very ill after my arrival here—& made worse by the heat—but have recovered—& to-day, Monday, feel about the same as formerly. Mother is well, & sends her love to you all—mother asked a great deal about Nelly, and also about Jenny—My brother George is remarkably well & robust this summer—he was out in all the excessive heat of the three latter days of last week, & came home every evening to his supper, unflagging, & full of strength & fun—I quite envied & admired him—especially as I felt deathly weak—indeed despicable—but, as before said, I think I am all right again now—I have not been out yet—havn't heard any news of special interest, literary or other—havn't seen Mrs. Price—but shall begin to explore, this week—& will report in my next—Dear Nelly, I had an unusually pleasant journey that afternoon & evening in the cars—felt quite well—enjoyed my lunch, the cold tea, &c—got in at Jersey City a few minutes after 10, not a bit tired—Nothing very new from my sisters Mat or Hannah—Eddy is as usual—Jenny, my darling, I must not forget to put in a line for you too, & send my love—William, do you see how Mrs. Stowe & the Atlanticites are getting cuffed & smitten front & rear, anent of the Byron resurrectionism? The papers are all having articles about it—& all condemn the Atlantic article.Walt.My address is 101 Portland av. opp. Arsenal Brooklyn, New York. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 23 August 1869"
