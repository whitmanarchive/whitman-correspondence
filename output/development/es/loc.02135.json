    "text": "April 15/90.12 Moreland stRoxbury, Boston.Dear Walt Whitman:I have seen reports that you were not so well just now, as we all hoped you'd be at opening of Spring. Let me send as a Spring message (as I sent a year ago) I find every where a growing respect and even tenderness for you. I have spoken several times during the year upon your work and have made converts always. The mere reading from some of your pages serving to open the eyes of my hearers. I am perfectly certain that this will be my spring message as long as you stay here with us.â€”As for myselfI am hard at work and beginning to succeed with the Century, Harpers, Arena etc. I am still too poor to do what I'd like in the way of having a copy of each edition of your works. I hope to be able to do soon. Please give my regards to Traubel and other friends. Ask him to send me a line if you do not feel like writing.With deepest regards,Hamlin Garland Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 15 April 1890"
