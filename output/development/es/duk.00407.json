    "text": "Van Ness & AmericanHOTELSBURLINGTON, VERMONT.The \"Van Ness House\" has a Safety Hydraulic Passenger Elevator, Fire Escapes, and the Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler.Fine Views of the Lakes and Mountains from all parts of the House.U. A. WOODBURY, Proprietor.L. S. DREW & H. N. CLARK, Managers.Burlington, Vt.,Aug 28 1888Bro Walt.Han was speaking about you; a minute ago. She is all the time guessing, wondering how Walt is. She recieves all your cards, letters, magazines, books/Antiquary, you send her. She is not very well: the weather has been hot, although our house is well shaded with the trees I planted 20 years ago. But I cannot but feel apprehensive that shall be compelled to give it up: prices of paintings are so low, and no purchasers, at that. I do not know what she would do, forced to quit her nice home: but such things will occur, and then it is, at my, or our age, like parting with life itself: there are times, when pinched by necessity and age, we feel that life is not worth living for. How well you have endured your trials, (physical) without complaining.Han is very nervous: taxes (25) are overdue: every year they are increased – pay no rent, yet taxes are something.I shall be pleased to see and read your book. My Sister Mrs Coll sends me a little money at times, which buys a load of wood and some groceries. Han says she is a good, good woman.I experience nervous prostration occasionally. I had a shock this morning: all things seemed rain – life not worth preserving. I am better now – Han would scold me for writing –Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1888"
