    "text": "Camden, New Jersey,April 3d 1886.My reading for the last two or three days (limited) of the articles in Century about Kearsarge and Alabama, which I have just finished. They form by far the best contribution I know to the literature of the Secession era, and are full of realism and thrill. The pictures are masterly. I only wish we could have accounts of all the swell episodes of the war in the same way, or approximately to it. I want personally to thank you all, writers and picture-makers.Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman to the Editor of the Century, 3 April 1886"
