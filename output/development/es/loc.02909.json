    "text": "5½ A.M.Jan. 11 '87Dear W.W.Your good long letter Jan. 10—recd It's so cold I could'nt sleep this morn. Your letter alarms me for yr health, somewhat. I have decided to come on & see you in a week or so. I will be very careful not to fatigue or bother you. I begin to see that it is useless to wait till you are free from other visitors. For Rhys says he is coming on to see you too, & you will always be more or less besieged. By coming on I could bring my MS with me, & stay three days at least. There is no hurry about the MS, for Wilson does not want it of course on hand, until the subscribers' names mount up pretty cheerily. He is anxious to have it boomed up through, & asks permission to announce it, wh.which I have granted by this mail. I am revising the MS. for punctuation & style.—Dr. B. sends me word that he will send me a list of Whitmanites. I have already made out a long one—going over all my scraps & records for the purpose Our brilliant young fellow Rhys is booming on here. I assume the papa toward him a little. We are trying to rub the British bloom \"off 'n him.\" We go to Sanborn's at Concord FridFriday to dine, Sat to St. Botolph's club goes he &c &c. He gets definite 'invite' to lecture bef.before 19 cent.century club. Farewell dear friend for to-day friend in the deepest sense. May we soon strike hands together! affec'yaffectionatelyWS Kennedy P.S. I must stop & roust up Rhys so he can read me his lecture to me before I go to work. Will send you my Herald article on him when it appears. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 11 January 1888"
