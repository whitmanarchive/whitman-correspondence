    "text": "Newark, New JerseyJune 21st, 1874Wm. H. Taylor201 Elm streetNewark, N.Y.My Dear FriendYour Letters & papers came early at hand. But I did not know that you had been sick until I received your Letter; But I hope you are improving, and will finally get all right again.I left New York in Oct. 1868 and me and my Brother started separated and I commenced to Paddle my own Canoe. I have A small route And keep A Dep't. And am making A fortune very Slow indeed, so slowâ€”that I shall never get rich; sent p. card April Business is present opposition in the milk trade and A great reduction in the price from 10 to 6 dls per quart. While the wholesale prices remain about the sameYou speak about your old friends in New York. Since I left there I have seen But few of the old Drivers, Henry Taylor alias (Sap Back), William Baun alias (Baulky Bill,) and old Jnop Rier is the only one that have Been over to see me. Taylor was over last week And lives at the war cleared out A good many of the old veteran drivers, And now I hear they have got the Boxes for all the Stages which will drop off A few things in general, And has never seen A sick day So far. And all the rest of us are in usual good Health. I should very much like to come and see you But my time is pretty much Occupied. But should very much like you come[you to come] and see me at any time you feel able.Enclosed you will find a card which my friends say resembles your Honorable Servant Very Much papers you when convenient. I suppose this is your last production.My Best Wishes, from your friend,William H. Taylor William H. Taylor to Walt Whitman, 21 June 1874"
