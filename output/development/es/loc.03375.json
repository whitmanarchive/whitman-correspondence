    "text": "Supreme Court LibraryMelbourne, Victoria12/3/90Dear Walt, my beloved master, my friend, my bard, my prophet and apostleI must write something to you now. I have tried during four years, but was not satisfied with my effort. Let my earnest will compensate for the imperfect manner + matter. I am only a poor clerk in a law library, I know, + it would be presumption on my part to write to any stranger in this way, but you are not a stranger to me, you are my dearest companion: and, if you feel displeased, you have brought it on yourself for none who understandingly read you can help loving you. I am not going to praise your poetry to you (we don't usually tell the sun that he does well to shine + shines well, or the grass do we praise for being green) + in regard to your other writings will only say that your hint re sunbaths has saved me many a day's illness + your essay on Carlyle has told me once a wanderer in the desert cracked by a material sun, that there is a night too glowing with star-life (in a word it caused me to study Hegel).Sometimes I take myself out of myself + gaze at what is going on in my mind. I often notice that I am defending you even when this unbiassed[unbiased] apart-Ego know or believe that you are a little wrong. We have great fights over you sometimes. My mates + I myself try to spread you everythwere + we find that every reverent student gets to love you while those who merely glance at you are sometimes nearly as virulent against you as those of your maligners who have never read you at all. I think we have profitted morally also from your indirections. You have driven away a good deal of pessimism from us + we can now work light-heartedly in our small spheres. I was a Roman Catholic once, + had been, thus, for generations under pessimistic influences that the revelations of science could not drive awayMy personal mates are Fred Woods, a draper, Jim Hartigan, a plasterer, an adorer of you, Ada Fryer a book-shop assistant (my sister-in-law) Ted Mackefer (a scapegrace, a swagman only, but a true mate of 11 years standing) + my wife. I am 24, red hair, plain features, a little too backward for my own good, fond of poetry, philosophy, science + going long walks, (Have got together a philosophy class of workmen + workwomen mainly + the avidity with which the revelations are seized is a pure pleasure to witness. My mates all send their love + I do so, enclosed by my own. We have a picture of you that appeared in a late Illustrated London News. It is over the mantelpiece + you seem quite at home with us. The other night several of us had the thought that you were listening as we were reading \"Piers the Plowman\" + that you were sympathisingsympathizing with him in his despair, although pleased at hearing a poet of the \"average man\" of that day. It was the Walt Whitman of our souls that listened of course but the picture was suggestive of the other thought.I wish you hadn't quite confined (in words) your \"home, I will make the continent indissoluble\" to America. Most of us make America mean the world, or sometimes we put \"Australia\" in its place. But I mustn't criticize, I mean most to tell you that I love you, that my mates love you + that ere so very long, the whole world shall love you +, what is more, all prove their love by actions such as you would approve. Poetically + philosophically you have solved the great equationâ€”Spiritualising = materialism. The little Camelot volume of your poems, sells well in Melbourne, a bookseller tells me.I don't want to give you trouble, + so, as your correspondence must be extensive, will not expect an answer, honoured as I would feel by one. I sincerely hope that your physical life is happy now + that pain does not allay your spiritual glory.With a \"handful out of my heart\"Good bye, Walt,So Long!Bernard O'DowdP.S. \"Tom Touchstone\" (Mr Bury) a journalist in Ballarat, + like you in many respects, first introduced you to me Bernard O'Dowd to Walt Whitman, 3 December 1890"
