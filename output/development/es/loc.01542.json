    "text": "18711872'72BrooklynFriday noon, Feb. 23. Dear son,Your letter rec'd this morning, speaks of the mild weather there—but it has been & remains very cold here—so much so that I don't go around half as much as I would like. My cold hangs on, though not so bad as at first. The state of the weather, & my cold, &c. have rather blocked me from having my usual enjoyment here, so far—but I expect to make up for it by and by. Dear son, I see you are off—I take it by your letter that you are feeling well in health, and having as good a time as the law allows—I wish we could be together there, some of these moonlight nights—but here it is too cold for comfort—(the water pipes here froze again last night, causing trouble)—I go out a couple of hours middle of the day, but keep in nights— —I have got the new edition of my book under way,—& it will be satisfactory I think—It will be in one volume, & will make a better appearance than any of the former ones—Do you go up to the debates in the Senate—I see by the papers they are having high times—Senator Schurz appears to come out ahead of them all—he is a real good speaker—I enjoy the way he shakes them up, (very much like a first-class terrier in a pit, with a lot of rats) Pete, I send you $10 enclosed, as you may need it—Should you want more, you write, as I have plenty—I am writing this up in my back room, home—have had a nice breakfast of hot potatoes & first-rate Oregon salmon—with the best coffee thats made—home-made bread, & sweet butter—every thing tip-top—get along well enough—you must try to do the same—so good bye, for this time, my own loving boy— Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 23 February 1872"
