    "text": "CamdenJuly 20 '89Dear C W Eyr's rec'd & welcomed, as always—So you have flitted north on the Pacific Coast & settled in San Francisco. Good—no doubt—To use the NY slang of low life I send you \"good roots\" for your new & future habitat——I am still holding out here—probably better than you might suppose—but bad enough—physically almost completely disabled—brain physique, locomotion, bladder business, digestion, &c: &c: all in pretty bad way—yet I sit up, read and write (moderately) & get out doors in a propell'd chair & keep good spirits—Nothing very significant in my literary affairs—hardly any sales—poor dear W O'C he has left by his death a great blank to me too—I just mail'd his little last book \"Donnelly's Reviewers\" to John Burroughs, who is temporarily at Hobart N Y & is well as usual—Hot Spell here—three weeks—to day bad.—I hear fm Dr Bucke often—Mrs. O'C (I fear by accounts) is left with very little financially—spent an hour down by the Delaware river side in my wheel chairWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 20 July 1889"
