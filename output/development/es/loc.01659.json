Send me the Herald to-morrow, (with one blue stamp on) you needn't mind the other Sunday papers—I send you Harper's magazine for September—I am still holding my own—gain a little strength, & am certainly improving though very slowly—both head & leg are bad enough, but general feeling is much better, most of the time—I have sent Philadelphia papers once or twice & may again—there is nothing in them, but I thought you would know I was still around—The weather here is pleasant, & cool enough, favorable to me—I get out a little every day—am going out when I finish this—Cannot write much to-day—am having a bad head ache all day—still I feel in good heart. So long, Pete, dear boy,Walt1875? Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 29 August [1873?]"
