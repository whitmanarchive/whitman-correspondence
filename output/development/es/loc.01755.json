    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West18731873Camden,Oct.October 16. 2 p.m.ThursdayDear son,I sent you a postal card yesterday that the bundle had come all right, with the right things I wanted. My condition is still what may be called favorable—that is I still keep up without having any of those decidedly bad spells—blurs as I call them—of a while ago—& in general I feel as well & as strong (such as it all was) as before I was taken with those spells. I go out again a little. Pete I told you about a young railroad man, Tom Osler, 26 years old, that I met occasionally & talked with, that had a felon on his hand—I took quite a fancy to him, & he to me—Well, he is dead, killed instantly—(I have marked the piece in the paper already sent)—I went around yesterday to where he lived, it is near here, he was married, leaves a young widow, & a nice little 2 year old boy—I saw them—his body, broken & scalded, lay in the front room—Whenever you have the Star or Republican once in a while you can send them (you can send 2 for a 1 ct stamp) I dontdon't mind their being a little old—I see the Chronicle and Capital at the reading room—I am feeling full as well as usual to-day, & think of going out & across the ferry—it is so pleasant this afternoonFriday afternoon—I went out yesterday afternoon—across to Philadelphia, & up to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, I have spoken of. Yesterday, & yesterday evening I felt better than usual—but am not so well to-day—the worst of my case is these fall backs—But I have been out a little to-day. My walking does not improve any at all. (Then to make things more cheerful, there are many deaths hereabout from paralysis)—I quite miss poor Tom Osler. I am in the habit of sitting of the forenoon by the first-floor window, reading the papers, & Tom would often stop a few minutes & talk to me at the window, on his way to & from the depot—He would never come in the house, but seemed to like to stop & talk that way with me. My boy that had his eye hurt is doing rather badly too. About myself, my general strength not only holds out, but I think rather improves, which helps a good deal. Your postal card came—also a letter from Eldridge, enclosing the key. Good bye for this time, my loving boy.Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 16[–17] October [1873]"
