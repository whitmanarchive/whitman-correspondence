    "text": "April 24 '68To Mr. Hotten,I am glad to hear you are having Mr. Conways potograph[photograph] engraved in place of the bad print now in the book. If a faithful presentation of that photograph can be given it will satisfy me well—of course it should be reproduced with all its shaggy, dappled, rough-skinned character & not attempted to be smoothed, or prettyfied—(if in time I send the following hints)—let the costume be kept very simple & broad, & rather kept down too, little as there is of it—preserve the effect of the sweeping lines making all that fine free angle below the chin—I would suggest not to bring in so fully the shoulders & bust as the photograph does—make only the neck, the collar with the immediately neighboring part of the shirt delineated. You will see that the spot at the left side of the hair, near the temple, is a white blur, & does not belong in the picture. The eyes part, and all around the eyes, try to re-produce fully & faithfully, exactly as in the photograph.I hope you have a good artist at the work. It is perhaps worth your taking special pains about, both to achieve a successfullsuccessful picture & likeness, something characteristic, & as certain to be a marked help to your edition of the book. Send me an early proof of the engraving—Thank you for the papers with notices in them—& for your Academia criticism. Please continue to send any special notices. I receive them safely & promptly. The London Review notice is reprinted here in Littell's Living Age. I should like to know who wrote the piece in the Morning Star—it flushed my friends & myself too, like a sun-dash, brief, hot, & dazzling.I have several things more to say, & will write again soon—Also to Mr. Rossetti to whom, meantime, please offer my friendliest, truest regards. Walt Whitman to John Camden Hotten, 24 April 1868"
