    "text": "Camden NJMarch 21For the last four days I have been and am now quite severely down again with muscular & nervous prostration, somewhat like formerly—aggravated this time with a painful & obstinate rheumatism (or neuralgia)—I count on its soon passing over, & leaving me about the same possession of my powers as of late—but it occurs to me to say to you that while I wish the prospecting for the NY lecture to go on—I think it would be best so—don't make any pledge about hall, or any other thing involving obligation, until further notice & advice from me—I have just got a letter from Johnston, the jeweler, asking me to come on to his house, & make it my home, in NY for the lecture trip. Very kind & very acceptable.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 21 March [1878]"
