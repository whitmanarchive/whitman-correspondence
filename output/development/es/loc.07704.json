    "text": "Camdenearly P M Sept: 25 '89 Dark & rainy weather continued—mild cold—moderate bowel action—still eat mutton & rice broth, Graham bread, honey & tea. Am sitting here in the 2d story room, alone, trying to while away the day—But this is all the old, old story—Am feeling fairly to-day but dull, dull—I told you that Harper's Monthly (H M Alden editor) had accepted & paid for \"Death's Valley,\" a little poemet to illustrate an engraving f'm a picture \"the shadow of the Valley of Death\" by the N Y painter Ennis (or Inness)—the Harpers Weekly (John Foord editor) has accepted & paid for \"Bravo! Paris Exposition!\" Ed is making up the bed as I write—I have been anxious ab't the French elections—glad republicanism has done as well as it has (for want of better)—it is the lodgement of free institutions in Europe that pends— I enclose John Burroughs' last—havn't heard f'm him since—thanks f'r y'rs— W W Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 25 September 1889"
