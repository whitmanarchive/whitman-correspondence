    "text": "J. H. JOHNSTON JEWELER No. 150 Bowery, COR. BROOME ST.New YorkJune 13th1883Dear Walt;The other day I learned that Gov. Cleveland was a great admirer of Walt Whitman. I at once wrote him a letter to let him know that JHJ was ditto, and that heâ€”JHJ would be delighted to bring you and the Gov. together. I have just rec'dreceived a very nice letter from him, and when you come on, if we dontdon't get him down to our house over Sunday (on the quiet) you and I will take a trip to Albany and pay our respects and have a splendid time. I just want the world to know that there is such a man as Gov Cleveland who loves W.W. It will boom another edition for you sure pop, and I hope you will come right over and smell the June roses with us.Sincerely yoursJ H JohnstonA letter from Dr Bucke this morning telling me he has ordered a copy of your life sent to me. Good fellow to remember me wasn't he?JHJ John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 13 June 1883"
