    "text": "BelmontMassApril 28 89Dear friend:—Let me thank you now, lest I forget it, for your kind thoughtfulness in offering to remember me with a copy of the new flexible pocket Ed.n of L. of G. It is what I have long wished for. I think the value of a book of poems is many times multiplied by being in pocket form. I recently b't (35 cts) a copy of Rhys's Ed.n. They had no business to sell it. It came over in an invoice of Camelot Classics. There are no more to be had here. But it is only a fragment—mutilated, & has mistakes in it. I bt it to lend to Whitman beginners & weaklings. Have loaned it now to Dr. Clarence J. Blake, the finest aurist in Boston.When will the little vol. be out? My yard is looking finely. 2 doz. hyacinths out.bye byeW. S. K.The squirrel is eating his nut on the hickory limb while the cat half-asleep in the house-gutter on the roof eyes him askance with one eye. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 28 April 1889"
