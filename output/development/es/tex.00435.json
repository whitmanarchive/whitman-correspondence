Or when you work'dworked on the horse-cars, and I waited for you, coming home late together—or resting and chatting at the Market, corner 7th Street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk or watermelons? Or during my tedious sickness and first paralysis ('731873) how you used to come to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven me, and chat for an hour or so—or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr. Drinkard had order'dordered for me—before you went on duty?Pete, give my love to dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash, and tell them I have not forgotten them, and never will.W.W. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, June 1883"
