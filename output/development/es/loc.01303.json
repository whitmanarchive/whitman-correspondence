I should accept with thanks from your hands any contribution from my Irish friends (Prof. Edw'd Dowden has already contributed liberally, & should not be solicited any further) Take leisure and ease ab't it & let it amount to what it may—or naught at all, if Destiny so disposes.(tr to last Send me word if the two Vols. reach you safely. The price is £2, which please remit me by p. o. order.) Yes, I should like to see the article in the Quarterly. My late bad spell of sickness seems to have passed over—I was out driving yesterday the three sunny midday hours, & enjoyed them much. Walt Whitman to Richard W. Colles, 18 November 1886"
