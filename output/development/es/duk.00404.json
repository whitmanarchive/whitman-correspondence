    "text": "Burlington Vermont June 23, 1885.Bro Walt,Just recieved Springfield paper, with extended notices of Walt Whitman. Came opportunely, for Han was growing nervous not recieveing any letter or card from you. She sprang right up, renewed, although she is not very strong as yet. And I was glad too, I assure you. Han is steadily improving; rather weakly and gray, but ambitious and systematic.I have been dreadfull sick too, but can now breathe nearly as well as usual. Every body congratulates me.We was as glad to learn that you are so comfortable with widow Davis: Han says she would so like to see her and talk with her: and so would I tell her so. My father was a sea captain; sailed from Philadelphia to France was wrecked, lost at sea: rember[remember] both of us to her: But what is the matter with Geo and Lou. I sent a small painting to them some months ago, framed, at 15 dollars with request to return it if not agreeable: have written twice, but recieved no reply.Perhaps Geo is short of cash; still they keep the picture view from our house, with the Lake (Battery view) where you used to stroll. Warm Han has large room up stairs to herself. I have small room adjoining: that I can hear, if she needs any thing: she is down stairs every day—cooks, I make fire etc—Han sends love—talks of you.Charles Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 23 June 1885"
