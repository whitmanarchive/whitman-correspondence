Gosse I sh'd call one of the amiable conventional wall-flowers of literature (see Thackeray—\"Yellowplush\" I think)—We too have numbers of good harmless well-fed sleek well-tamed fellows, like well-order'd parlors, crowded all over with wealth of books (generally gilt & morroco) & statuary & pictures & bric-a-brac—lots of 'em & showing first-rate—but no more real pulse and appreciation than the wood floors or lime & sand walls—(one almost wonders whether literary, even Emersonian, culture dont lead to all that)— Toward noon weather here turns to rain—bet'n 12 and 1 I had a good massage, pummeling &c.—bath also—have had a visit f'm some of the Unitarian conference—y'rs of 29th rec'd—my head, hearing, eyes, bad to-day, yet I am feeling pretty fairly—a present f'm R P Smith of a cheque for $25 to-day—sent him the pk't-b'k morroco ed'n of L of G—Mrs: Davis off to-day to Doylestown, Penn: (20 miles f'm here) to visit & comfort a very old couple—returns to-night—my sailor boy has just written to Ed & has gone to the p o to take it—it is towards 3 P M & dark & glum out & I am alone—have a good oak fire—am sitting here vacant enough, as you may fancy (but it might be worse)—have myself for company, such as it is, any how—God bless you all— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 31 October 1889"
