    "text": "431 Stevens St—Camden, N Jersey U S America—Sept 1, '76My dear friend,At last I am beginning to receive from the bindery the second batch of my late Two Volume edition (I print 600 copies each Vol.) & send you a set in the new binding, by this mail. I am now at last also supplying my English subscribers & friends their Vols.—have sent their books, postpaid, by same mail with this to several of them (see list appended)—& the rest will follow, until every one will be sent—probably within the next ten days. I sent you the Vol. for Mrs. Matthews, as the address was too indefinite—How about G. W. Foote and J. T. Nettleship mention'd by you & giving extracts, under date of May 23d? Their names do not appear in the lists you have given me to send books to. The Athenaeum folks have sent me good pay for the little poem, but I have had nothing, & heard nothing from the Examiner. I expected to have heard of Mrs. Gilchrist's arrival in The U.S. & to have had perhaps ere this the great happiness of meeting her—but have heard nothing up to date. My letter of June 26, speaking of the situation, the delay in printing this second batch, &c.—And my letter of July 3d acknowledging yours of June 20, enclosing one £45-9-6, & list—you have. I enclose herewith a later circular—will send you a dozen or so soon. My dear little baby-nephew, & namesake, is dead, & buried by the side of my mother, a bitter cup to me—Otherwise things are about the same with me as before—& I am jogging along about the same. Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 1 September 1876"
