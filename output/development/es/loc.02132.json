    "text": "Jamaica Plain.Nov. 9/88.Dear Mr. Whitman:I talked last night to my Waltham class (of forty ladies) about your work and read to them. I wish you could have seen how deeply attentive they were and how moved by \"Out of the Cradle\" \"To Think of Time\" \"Sparkles from the Wheel\" and others. Many of them will now read your works carefully and understandingly. I told them to come at you through \"Specimen Days.\" I always advise my pupils so. After reading your prose they are better prepared to sympathize with your poetic views. I am much pleased with \"November Boughs\" and expect to do quite a good review soon. Mr. Clement of The Transcript is a personal friend and is quite kindly disposed toward your work. Indeed, all the leading men on The Transcript are. Baxter is away. Kennedy I have not seen. Chamberlain is in the library as usual. I think I told you of the good letter I had from Burroughs. I hope Mr. Howells will succeed in doing something for \"November Boughs\" in the December number it is such a great number usually.It rejoices me to think you are gaining. I hope the winter will not be too severe for you. Though I believe you stand the cold better than the heat. I hope to hear a word from you occasionally.Very sincerelyâ€”Hamlin GarlandSee notes Nov 10 1888 Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1888"
