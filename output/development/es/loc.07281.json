I am very glad Ed.W. is with you these bad times instead of Musgrove—I feel sure Ed. will do Every thing in his power for you. I shall write a special letter as soon as I get the big book. I wish we could hear from O'Connor I fear he is in a bad way.If the thing was possible I should go to Camden and stay with you—but it is not possible so no use talking of it. Perhaps I could do no good if I was there certainly you have a better doctor by far than I am—I mean Osler. But it seems to me they do not take the interest they ought.We are all well here, cold weather but no sleighing yet.I send my best loveR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 15 December 1888"
