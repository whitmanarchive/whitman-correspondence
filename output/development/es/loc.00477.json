    "text": "OFFICE OF THE WATER COMMISSIONERSt. Louis,Oct 29 1882Dear brother WaltI append slip from the Evening paper of last Thursday that frightened us all so. I telegraphed Thursday evening and again Friday—and was on my way to the telegraph office yesterday afternoon when I was handed your dispatch. We were all glad to know that the statement was wrong although as the time passed and I had an opportunity to reason it over I felt pretty well assured that there was a mistake in the statement—The morning papers of Friday, however, all repeated the statement and gave as authority the press reportsI hope you are all o.k. again and able to get around as usual. If you are tied down to the house I imagine you feel pretty sick. In my own case when sick I find that the fact that I cannot get out makes me feel as badly as anything elseWe are all well and getting on quite nicely. The girls have been busy \"putting up\" large quantities of all sorts of stuff in the pickle &c line—as much to practice I presume as with any idea that it would be neededI have had considerable to do this summer—have only been away once (to St Joseph) since I was East—I expect to go to St Jo the last of this week—and toward the middle or last of Nov hope to come East—at least as far as Camden—so dontdon't be surprised to see me pop in at any timeAll send love to George and Lou and to yourself—by-the-way I must be considerable behind in regard to Ed's board—when George or Lou write ask them to please state how far and I will square up—We are having splendid fall weather—never so delightful—I have just finished a seven days out door survey—putting up at the nearest place where night found us—the country was new to me and very beautiful—the weather perfect—it was like going back 25 years. Let me hear from you soon—again love to allAffectionatelyJeffWALT. WHITMAN.The Author of \"Leaves of Grass\" said to be Dying.Special to the Post-Dispatch.CAMDEN, N. J., October 26.—Walt. Whitman is so seriously ill of Bright's disease that few if any hopes for his recovery are entertained. Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 29 October 1882"
