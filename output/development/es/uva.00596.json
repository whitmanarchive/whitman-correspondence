B) & paid the money. To-day quiet & warm & dull here muchly—I am sitting up in the 2d story room alone—door & windows open—Did you or George get my little poem in N Y World Friday mn'g last, or Camden Courier same evn'g?—If not I will send you one—W W Walt Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman, 9 June 1889"
