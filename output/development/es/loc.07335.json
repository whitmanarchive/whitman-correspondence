    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,17 Jan 1890Your card of 14th came to hand yesterday afternoon just after I had written you and this morning I got the \"Critic\" and \"Spectator\". You say \"Symonds letter was not mailed to you\"—how was that? I hope it will be? I have heard so much about it from Horace and yourself that I am very anxious to see it. Please have it sent if possible. So you are still clear of La Grippe? I hope you may stay clear of it with all my heart. It is a confounded nuisance and especially so about a big institution like this.—We are still suffering severely from it though I trust we are throughthe worst. As regards myself and household we may be said to be about over it. This last two week we have had no dances and very little amusements of any sort—paralized with La Grippe. Yes, you told me before that Kennedy had gone into \"Transcript\" office as proofreader. Don't hear anymore about his \"W.W.\"? I am glad to notice that you still get out from time to time in the wheel=chair. The wife of John Nesbit (partner with W.J. Gurd & self in meter) died yesterday in Sarnia—La Grippe partly responsible, Gurd is going to Sarnia this evening to the funeral. Meter matters and pretty much all matters are at a standstill for the presentR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 January 1890"
