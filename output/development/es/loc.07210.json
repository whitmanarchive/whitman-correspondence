    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeASYLUMFOR THE INSANELONDON ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,11 Mch 1888I have been and am still in considerable of a flustration here—have had the Inspector, he left yesterday, have to go to Toronto this afternoon to interview the minister of Public Works about the new building to replace one burned. Shall be back here again Monday evening or Tuesday. We are all well, sleighing's done though still a great deal of ice and snow over the fields &c I enclose Lippencott's letter—have heard nothing since about the Worthington business. Have done nothing more with my W.W. paper, shall rewrite it as soon as I get a little time (a mighty hard thing to find nowadays) and I think send it to Walsh of Lippencott. Or would it be well to keep it until Kennedy's book comes out (will be out very soon now I suppose?) and incorperate it in a notice of that book—?In any case I shall get to work elaborating it as soon as I can—It has been snowing, & blowing great guns all day—there is a lull now and sun trying to come out.Always affectionatelyR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 March 1888"
