    "text": "Goldsmith Building, Temple.January the 20thDear SirIn December I received from you a post-card, under date St Louis Misouri[Missouri] NovNovember 20, saying that you had been detained from home by illness but would soon return, when you would send to me the two books (Vistas & Memoranda) which I wrote to you for back in the fall. Since that I have not heard from you—this makes me rather anxious to know that you are still getting on towards recovering your health—I am very glad indeed that you have had such a \"good time\" in the west of the States, but it would be sad if you were to be ill for long as a consequence of your travel.I have now sent you a post office order for 21 shillings—This is for your second volume of the complete Edition of 1875 (\"Two Rivulets\") I have a very dear cousin Ethel Thompson—who lately became 21 years old. That is an occasion for rejoicing and congratulating people over here. I don't know why. I think people ought to be condoled with, rather. Anyhow, it is also the practice to cheer them up with presents—and, as I believed that your \"Leaves of Grass\" would give my cousin more pleasure than anything else I could give her, I gave her that book.But her sister—another woman who is dear to me—Honora Thompson—had thought just the same and gave her the same book! So I have taken back \"Leaves of Grass\" and am going to keep it as a loan copy. That is a copy to lend to those who know little about your poems and want to know more.And I am going to give to Ethel Thompson \"Two Rivulets\" so that she will be the gainer by two of her friends' having determined to give her Whitman as a birthday present.I want you, if you will, to write in the book \"Ethel Thompson from Joseph William Thompson, December the 15th 1879\" and, having written this, to sign it with your own name and the actual date of your so signing. Do you mind doing this for me and then sending it off by post to— Ethel ThompsonCharles Thompson—esquire—Preswylfanear CardiffEngland. I shall be very grateful to you, but not so grateful as I am for your having written what you have written (in your book, I mean).Honora Thompson tells me that she was not able satisfactorily to answer two questions which you put to her about the selection of your poems made by Mr W. M. Rossetti, I can tell you. The book is out of print and the publishers—Messrs Chatto and Windus (of Piccadilly— London) have definitely answer'd the question as to whether they were going to republish it in the negative.You say that you never received any thing from the publishers on account of that selection. But do you think that a profit was made? From the manner in which Mr Rossetti writes in the preface, I should think it very possible that it was a 'labourlabor of love' on his part to bring the book out, and that he neither hoped for nor got any gain excepting the knowledge that he had done his best to make your works better known in England.That is how it seems to me—I know nothing.But many in England are anxious that there should be a good selection of your poems in a popular form, so that all may gradually get knowledge of them. I who write to you am young (26) and inexperienced. I have lately abandoned my intention—half-formed—of trying to earn my living at the bar—and I am uncertain what work I shall do. But some work, some good to the world, I will try to do. Amongst other things, if it is not done before I can put my hand to it, I will, if you will give me leave, make and bring out a selection of your poems and sell it at a cheap price. People will not give 10 dollars—or 5—for that of which they know nothing. And thus you remain an unknown writer to the great mass of Englishmen and Englishwomen. I hope that, come time, I shall write to you for your permission—At present, I cannot undertake this work—I want to have a more thorough knowledge—such knowledge as the digesting by time can alone give—of your poems, and I need not add that if it came in my path to come to America to see you, it is a chance which I should very eagerly grasp at. That may possibly happen in the summer of next year. I do not know.Meanwhile, a Mr Lewin of Birkenhead, who edits a small quarterly magazine called \"Papers for the Times\" seems to wish to reprint here the \"Preface to Leaves of Grass\" which you have omitted from all your later editions—May I ask you why you have omitted it? I know that you have practically embodied some of it in your other poems—but not all of it. I myself do not know whether your preface is in reality a preface—something good to prefix—or itself a poem just as much as the other poems are. I have thought that that might be the reason for your no longer printing it as a preface. I have told Mr Lewin that I would ask you as to your wishes with regard to it being reprinted. I must tell you that Mr Lewin or whoever should undertake it would in all probability have no margin of profit, but (probably) a margin the other way—But if I, personally, had anything to do with the publishing, I should make it a condition that any profit that there might be should be handed over to you.I am afraid that my letter is growing to a much-too-great size, but there is one more topic. Mr Edward Carpenter has been so kind as to lend me Mr Burroughs's \"Walt Whitman as Poet and Person\" which I have read with very great interest. Mr Child (I think his name is) at Trubner'sTrübner's (the publisher's) says that he believes you have the remaining stock of these books. Is this so? If so, will you kindly send me a copy, to this address (Goldsmith Building, Temple, London) and let me know what I owe you for it. Mr Carpenter's copy of the book (1867) was pubdpublished by the American News Company, but I have seen it spoken of as being published by J.S. Redfield—in 1871. Perhaps that is a later edition.I am, dear sir,Yours affectionatelyJ.W. ThompsonWalt Whitman—Camden, New Jersey. Joseph W. Thompson to Walt Whitman, 20 January 1880"
