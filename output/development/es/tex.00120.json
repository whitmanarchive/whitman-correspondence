    "text": "Camden Sept 6th 1871 Dear WaltI see by this morning's paper, that Starr & Co. has taken the contract for the 36 in pipes for Washington & I am thinking of trying to get the inspecting of them. Genl Greene I understand is appointed Chief Eng'r of the Dept. of Public Wks, but Major Elliot has the immediate charge of Water Dept.Do you know Maj. Elliot and if so can you find out from him if he has any particular person that he wants to inspect the pipes. I would like to find out if it would be of any use for me to go to Washington & see him in regard to the matter. I do not care to go unless I have a good show for the work. I could refer him to Mr Kirkwood, Genl Greene, Mr Lane, Col Adams, Mr. Tracy, Davis &C. Walt cant you stop here on your return to Washington, Â if you could only bring Mother we would be delighted. George George Washington Whitman to Walt Whitman, 6 September 1871"
