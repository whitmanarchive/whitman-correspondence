    "text": "CamdenNov. 17 '87 noonI express'd the plaster head to you last evening pre-paid, address'd to you, care of Sylvester Baxter, Herald office, 255 Washington st. Boston—it is in a stout rather heavy box—I myself like the head muchly—it is what we call the 2d head—Morse made one, the 1st, with more brooding repose & dignity, more of the antique spirit &c. wh' many like best—it is good, & attractive but tho' I like the 1st decidedly I am quite clear this is the typical one, modern, reaching out, looking ahead, democratic, more touch of animation (perhaps unsettledness) &c. &c.—not intended to be polished off—left purposely a little in the rough—I suppose you rec'd my cards—You and S B think over what I say ab't giving the head to some Boston Art Institution or (if you prefer) other depositary, appropriate.You & he have absolute power to dispose of it in that way—It ought to be ready for you there at the Herald office, Friday or Saturday morning—I also sent you by mail to Belmont the Cox photo you requested—hope you will write me Tuesday (or Wednesday) ab't all, the meeting &c. details—I am ab't as usual, health &c—pretty dull & heavy—M D Conway has been to see me—No word from O'C[onnor]. Morse is here. I expect to see Ernest Rhys soon. I get word from Dr B[ucke] often. Sunshiny out to-day—I think of going forth with horse & rig after dinner—God bless you and wife—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 17 November 1887"
