    "text": "SyracuseDec 27th/68Walt WhitmanDear FriendI suppose you will think by this time that I have forgotten my Dear old Friend by my long silence & neglect to answer your letter, or acknowledge the receipt of your paper that you was so kind as to send me, but I assure you that I have not forgot you but sill remember you with the same Love that commenced in Armory Square Hospital & will not cease as long as life lasts.There is not a day that passes but what I think of you & promise myself that I will not delay writing to you any longer but as often I break my promise.We have had excellent Sleighing here for the past two or three weeks and it still continues to be good & all that can afford it seem to enjoy it very much.I am at work in the Melodeon & Piano Factory of A. C. Chase again and shall probably continue there this winter. My health is very good. Father has been quite sick for a week but is improving now. Father & Mother send their Love to you.Our Baby Walt is a fine boy now & as bright as a dollar. I hope to have the pleasure of showing him to you someday.If you come to New York next summer & cannot come up and make me a short visit let me know when you are coming and if my business will permit I will meet you at new york and have a short visit with you there.I hope that the exit of A Johnson & the inauguration of Gen Grant will restore the country to a Peace footing in a very short time.I gave our Friends the Misses Riley a letter of introduction to you when they were here last fall. have you seen them yet. Hamilton is well as usual & is still running on the Rail Road. He sends his Love to youHoping you had a merry Christmas & wishing you a happy New Year. I will close for the presentPlease write soon.yours with LoveB. H. Wilson. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 27 December 1868"
