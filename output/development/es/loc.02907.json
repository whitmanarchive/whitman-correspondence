    "text": "Anerley Park. S.E.March 30 1886My dear Sir: I have sent through my publishers a vol.volume of my essays on Poetry & Poets, containing an essay on your own work, reprinted with additions from one I wrote some years ago—which I have been sorry not to see mentioned in the volumes of Dr Bucke and John Burroughs—for I understand that you, & Mr. Burroughs had approved of it & (as you know) I have long been a grateful & warm admirer. Please let me have a line, if you are well enough, as I hope may be the case, to write. I welcome the vol.volume of young Mr. Rhys, & trust it will make you well known among us. If you should come to England, I hope you will not forget that you would find a warm welcome in our house. Ever yours with affectionate respect,Roden Noel P.S. I hope you may have seen & cared for some of my own work in poetry. I believe I sent you an early & immature volume, but not hearing from you did not send later, & stronger work. see notes July 6 & 7 1888from Roden Noel April '86 Roden Noel to Walt Whitman, 30 March 1886"
