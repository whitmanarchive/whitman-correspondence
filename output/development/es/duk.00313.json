    "text": "'61Camp Brooklyn near Baltimore June 28 My dear MotherYour letter and Walts came all right and glad enough was I hear that you are getting a little better. You must have had a hard time Mother being sick so long but do not get discouraged and I hope you will soon be as well as ever.We have Just moved our camp. The place werewhere we were first was a hill without a tree or any sort of shade. werewhere we are now there are plenty of shade trees so that we are very comfortable. I am Just as well and hearty as can be I have slept out in the rain and on the ground but have not felt a bit the worse for it so I think I can go through like a book. When we first came here our camp was fired into for three or four nights in succession  there were four or five shots fired each night and we could hear the balls whiz through the camp but no one was struck. I and half a dozen others were sent out to scout about and see what we could find  we took our pistols and India rubber blankets and lay down in the grass about 200 yards from each other (the place werewhere we are is about like Bedford)  we were out two nights and brought in about a dozen chaps but they were all let go as there was nothing against them but hanging around the camp. I and two others were sent out the other day to arest[arrest] a secession soldier from Harpers Ferry who it is suposedsupposed came on here as a spy. We went out in the city  the chap that gave us the information shewed us the house and we went in and took him and brought him to camp  he was sent to Fort McHenry the same day to be tried for a spy. This city is a regular secession place  as we walk through the streets in the city the Women and children make a regular practice of saying as we pass them hurahhurrah for Jeff Davis  the men dont[don't] say anything but you can see by the looks of the most of them that they dont[don't] like us at all. This city was placed under Marshal law yesterday and the celebrated Marshal Kane was arested[arrested] and sent to the Fort. It kicked up quite an excitement in the city but they did not go any further than to stand on the corners and growl. It would not have been well for them to have made any row as there are about 8000 Troops encamped about here with a Splendid Battery of Artilery[Artillery] of 8 peices[pieces]  the Batery[Battery] and two of the regiments are from Massachusets[Massachusetts] and they would like very mutch[much] to get square for the afair[affair] on the 19th of April. Well Mother the three Months is going fast and I shall soon be with you again. I see some very foolish articles in the papers about us sutch[such] as not haveing[having] any thing to eat for 36 hours and being almost naked but you must not believe any thing of the kind as we are as well off as we could expect  You speak in your letter of sending me on some Money.  We expect to get our pay from Government in the course of a few days but if we do not I have enough to last me untill[until] I get home. Mother you need not wory[worry] about me at all as I am not in want of anything and I dont[don't] believe we shal[shall] see any fighting at all. I was sent out on a scout again last night  I went all around outside of the picket guard and down in the city but after ten O Clock it was as quiet as Brooklyn  Well good bye Mother  give my love to all and let me hear from you again right away.G W WhitmanBaltimore | June 28 '61 George Washington Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 28 June [1861]"
