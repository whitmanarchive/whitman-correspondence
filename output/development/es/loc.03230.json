    "text": "41 Bowdoin St.Cambridge, Mass.April 20. 1878.My Dear Sir,I saw Mr. Burroughs in New York, lately, & he encouraged me to believe that I might get from you some news of your new book. I am anxious to see some proofs or early sheets, in order to write an account of it to the London Academy. If it is possible, will you oblige me in this matter?I have confessed to Burroughs my admiration of the spirit you have breathed into the air, to enlarge & stimulate the after- comers, the young writers of America. At times, I have had an intense longing to express my gratitude to you yourself; & it was a sharp disappointment to me that I could not come down to Mrs. Gilchrist's, last summer, with the young Englishman, Carpenter, to meet you.But I am not gifted with the faculty of praising. Where I greatly admire I am most likely to be silent; & I never felt it quite the time to speak to you. Well, this time is not come now; it hardly comes at all. The secret of our reluctance to make acknowledgement to those whom we owe much in the spiritual way is, probably, that we know it is impossible ever to give adequate utterance to such matters; & to speak at all is almost to obscure the sentiment instead of revealing it. If I myself could choose, & had done anything, I would by preference take silent recognition, though personal expression of appreciation is certainly a great balm, at times.In writing, now, I have another project to advance, besides that of seeing your new book. I am getting up a volume of poems to be published anonymously by Messrs. Roberts Brothers, of Boston. Of course these are of the older & prevalent fashion. They are by a number of poets, some of whom are very well known. I don't know whether you will feel like participating in this scheme; but there are some advantages about it which may strike you. If they do, I would greatly like to have you send me two or three short pieces with a view to insertion in this book. Owing to the general character of the collection, however, your contribution would have to conform to the more usual rhythms at least as far as \"Captain, my Captain!\" Have you anything lying by youâ€”especially of a patriotic tone?There is time enough yet; the copy will not be prepared for the printers until September. But, if you look favorably on the plan, please let me know before long.Meanwhile, the new book.Very sincerely yours,G.P. Lathrop.I think you have corresponded with Albert Otis, a lawyer of Boston, whom I know. You have more appreciators here than you suspect. George Parsons Lathrop to Walt Whitman, 20 April 1878"
