Please send me a circular of his publications—(you may show him this letter)—As far as I am concerned, I shall leave the matter entirely to you. If you think him the proper man & he is willing to take the book let him & his place—if Osgood & Co. say so—be the settled London publication office & depositoryWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Josiah Child, 8 December 1881"
