    "text": "Sarnia Ont.OntarioJune 29th 1880My dearest Friend,Perhaps you thought I had forgotten you, but I have not much time to myself on school-days. Do you remember the nice sail we had that night on the lake and river, I will never forget it, you, and I had such a pleasant time up in the bow of the boat when I sat on your lap and asked you questions about the which you wrote about in your book named Two Rivulets. Our mid-summer-holidays begin on the thirteenth of July and I think that I am going down to London then if all is well and Mr Bucke has asked me to stay at his place first so that I will be able to see you again for I do miss you so much since you have gone. I suppose you will have plenty of fun on Dominion Day, I expect to as we always did before. I am going to by some fire-cracker and go up to the lake to shoot them off as it is against the law to fire them off within the limits of the town. When you write to me please tell me how you enjoyed Dominion Day for I would like to know. Please give my love to all and as I have told you all I know I will close here.I remainYour loving FriendNorman McKenzie. Norman McKenzie to Walt Whitman, 29 June 1880"
