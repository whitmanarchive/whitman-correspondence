    "text": "Shorters Court.Throgmorton St.London EC.29 Feb./1876.Dear Sir,The papers say you are engaged upon a complete Edition of your Poems. I have been an admirer thereof for some six years, and believe myself to have learned from them.I have the Roſsetti Edition, but should like to have the complete one. I enclose a money order for £4.180 (somewhere about $20), for an early copy.I would send you a volume of poems of my own, but they are very juvenile; and I would rather not be known of by them.Would your health permit you to come to England? My wife & I would both be delighted if you could come and stay with us so long as might suit you. I expect in the spring we shall be resident a few miles out of London.With our best regardsyours faithfullyKenningale Cook.Walt Whitman. Kenningale Cook to Walt Whitman, 29 February 1876"
