    "text": "New YorkJan 11th/69Mr. Walt Whitman,SirIt is with great pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand to addressaddress a few lines to you hoping to find you enjoying good health which same I am enjoying myself.I felt very sorry that I did not see you previous to your departure for Washington We have had a very pleasant New Year in the city and the weather has continued very favorable since with the exception of one snow storm, but as luck would have it I was not exposed to it, for I have been discharged from the Road since New Years Eve and have not done anything since, in fact I have not had a chance to look for anything since because I have been suffering with a very sore foot which has confined me to the house, but I am now able to walk around and hope shall be able to find something to do very shortly as I do not feel contented without working; but still and withal I hope that will not be the cause of separating our friendship for no matter where I am employed or what it may be at I shall still continue to correspond and can never forget your kind friendship towards meWishing you many a Happy Year I remainYour True and Ever intimate friendJohn Flood, Jr.No. 50. GoverneurGouverneur St.N.Y City. John Flood, Jr., to Walt Whitman, 11 January 1869"
