    "text": "77 West Brookline BostonSept 3 1888My dear loved PoetI greet you with open arms and kiss you lovingly and thank you over and over again for every word you have written for me and mine—and for your dear face, which you have given us I like each one—but I like the one with hat off the best of the three as it gives me your full face—and so good I am going to paint you in oil and in pastel and my daughter is going to do a pen and ink sketchI shall paint the house where you were born and I hope I may have you as you are in your home at Camden—sometime—my daughter is in love with you and desires to see you personally so much should you come to Boston do not fail to visit us none could appreciate you more we should greet you with love and tears we are yours lovingly and may the dear loving Father keep you tenderly while you remain of the earth and \"when the mist have blown away may we know each other better\"It will be delightful, no ills, no pain, no mental indigestion—all can digest every word you have written, and prudery and false modesty will be no more thought of, and no one will think harm to look lovingly on all that God has created the nude which is so beautiful—so wonderful wont you come to Boston—soon over on last page We desire to see you so much do not fail to see us if you should comeYours lovingly and sincerelyMrs C. F. StoweIf you could give me a moment of your precious time I would be pleased to receive a few words that I may know you have received this letter—may you dear one enjoy this beautiful morning—the pure air and bright sunshine and God's love in all—Mrs C F Stowe Mrs. C. F. Stowe to Walt Whitman, 3 September 1888"
