    "text": "328 Mickle Street Camden New Jersey Jan: 19 '85Dear SirIn hasty answer to your request asking me to specify over my own signature what years I worked as an editorial writer in the Brooklyn Times office I would say that if I remember right it was along in 1856, or just before. I recollect (doubtless I am now going to be egotistical about it,) the question of the new Water Works (magnificently outlined by McAlpine, and duly carried out and improved by Kirkwood, first-class engineers both,) was still pending, and the works, though well under way, continued to be strongly opposed by many. With the consent of the proprietor, I bent the whole weight of the paper steadily in favor of the McAlpine plan, as against a flimsy, cheap and temporary series of works that would have long since broken down, and disgraced the city.This, with my course on another matter, the securing to public use of Washington Park (Old Fort Greene,) stoutly championed by me some thirty-five years ago, against heavy odds, during an editorship of the Brooklyn Eagle, are \"feathers in my wings\" that I would wish to preserve.I heard lately with genuine sorrow of the death of George C Bennett. I remember him well as a good, generous, honorable man.I send best greetings to your staff, and indeed to all the Brooklyn journalists.Walt WhitmanPrivate—C M S—Dear SirYou are at liberty to print letter, if you desire—If so read proof very carefully & copy—& don't forget to send me here a couple of papers—W WTo CHARLES M. SKiNNeR | Walt Whitman Camden, N.J., Jan. 19, 1885. see envelope Walt Whitman to Charles M. Skinner, 19 January 1885"
