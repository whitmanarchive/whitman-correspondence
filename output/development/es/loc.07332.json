    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,10 Jan 1890Yours of 7th to hand last evening. It was (as always) heartily welcome. Yes, you are living on your ancestry at present, if that had not been A.1, W.W. would have been under the sod fifteen months ago—at least. I was real glad to get Miss Alys' letter to you, re Mrs Costelloe, and to see by it that Mrs C. was in better health. I was also glad to get the cutting re Browning who seems to have been a mighty fine fellow. I shd like to know whether he was really of Jewish stock (as they say) I think it more than likely I believe that is the greatest stock of all and am never surprised to find that it is an element in a great man. Well, we still have La Grippe here though things are mending a little with us. The doctors are allout of bed again but are a long way from up to par yet. There are still many members of the staff (attendants &c) who are sick or half sick. I hope hope however we are over the worst of it. Willy Gurd is mending, is able to sit up now. The children are mostly better but some of them ailing yet. I have opened an infirmary for 40 patients—20 men and 20 women—within the last few days—this has been making a little extra work lately so that La Grippe struck us in a bad time—but we will worry along and after a little we shall get into daylight again.your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 10 January 1890"
