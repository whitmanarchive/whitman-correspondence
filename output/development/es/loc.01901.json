Smith desires to see you for a short time; and it is with pleasure that I give her this note to you.â€”She has all the merits that you admire, and if she be not appalled by your greatness, or the shadow of it, you will have a good time with herA lady friend of hers here in New York tells me that Miss Smith proposes to make you a feature in some sort of production, but of this I know nothing. I am certain that if she does, you will enjoy itSo, Walt, whether she writes to you, visits you, or otherwise enters into relations with you; you will know that she is an admirer of yourself, and a friend ofJohn Swinton John Swinton to Walt Whitman, [24] September 1877"
