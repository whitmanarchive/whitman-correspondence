    "text": "BrooklynMonday forenoon, July 24. Dear Pete,I rec'd the $50 to-day all right, and a real help to me—I have money, but cannot have the use of it just now—so this comes first rate—I spent yesterday down on the sea-shore—was all by myself—had a splendid good day—took my dinner with me—went down in the boat 12 miles in the morning, & back in a big open horse car, toward evening, through the fields & woods—very pleasant indeed—staid a long while in the water—weather perfect—Mother is better to-day—she has been pretty sick, with several ups & downs—I am as well as a fellow can be—eat & sleep tremendous—Shall stay here a week or so longer—shall be back first part of next week if nothing happens—Well, Pete, I believe that is all this morning—Good bye, my darling son, and a long, long kiss from your loving father Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 24 July [1871]"
