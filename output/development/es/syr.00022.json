    "text": "see notes March 30 1889Providence, R.I.March 15, 1883Dear Walt:I got continued proofs of the G.G.PGood Grey Poet this morning, and your letter of the 14th this afternoon.I find from this batch of proofs the necessity for a revise, which I hope you will have sent me, for I want the G.G.PGood Grey Poet to appear as it was in the pamphlet, a form which always pleased us both, and you will see by my corrections, what a mess the poor printer has made of it. It is evidently not his fault, but Bucke's, and I really felt vexed at him. I furnished him with a carefully transcribed printer's copy of the pamphlet, and it is evident that the galoot has had my copy copied—his copy is of course omitting all the typographical directions and making paragraphs ad libitum. Hence, the mess! Why in thunder didn't Bucke send the copy I made for him!However, spilt milk, &c. Send me revises of both documents. It will hardly delay matters, and there will be the consolation of accuracy.My Good Gray reads really well in the new version. I had no idea it was so good!!I am glad you liked the Introductory. It is likely to make some very pretty fighting, before all is done.After I sent it back to you, I remembered one typographical error I meant to correct, but forgot it after all. It is on the first slip where I speak of Paul Louis Courier's \"arrows of lightning.\" This should be \"arrows of lightnings\"—double plural. If I get a revise, I will correct: if not, you please have an \"s\" put on to my \"lightning\"—it is more effective, though a small matter.Dr. Channing and all send love to you. Jeannie is very weak, though her mind is bright and clear. If she weathers through this harsh spring, I shall have hopes of her. She has immense vitality, but injures her chances by ascetic notions—total abstinence, etc.—and general desperate HahnemanianismHahnemannianism. It is bad when you don't do, in a general way what other people do, and go back upon a fair allowance of victuals and drink.I got the \"Man\" this afternoon with Parton's version of Hugo's magnificent oration on Voltaire, also the Trubner[Tr catalogue, which I have not yet had time to look into. Thanks.Au revoirFaithfullyW. D. O'ConnorW. W.P.S. If the printer is puzzled show him a page of the pamphlet, which will show him how I want it set, with the short dashes following the periods, etc. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 15 March 1883"
