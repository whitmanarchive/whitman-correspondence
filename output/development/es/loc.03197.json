W.20th Aug 1884Dear Sir /I am very much obliged by your kind offer of the little M.S.manuscript on \"What lurks behind Shakespeare's Historical Plays?\" & greatly regret that its extreme brevity renders it hardly suitable as an article for the XIXth Century.I return it accordingly herewith but in the hope that you may see your way to amplify the treatment beyond its present limits of a mere hint or suggestion, & give it the importance by way of illustration & proof which the subject deserves. Hoping to hear again from you & thanking you cordially for writing to me at all, I remain Yours very trulyJames KnowlesWalt Whitman Esq James Knowles to Walt Whitman, 20 August 1884"
