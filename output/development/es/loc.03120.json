    "text": "Pf fromTranscript OfficeBostonJan 19 '913.P.M.Dear WW.Yes of course let Traubel have it (the Dutch article). I am just as well pleased, & glad the Lippincott project is not abandoned, too. I think Traubel's paper just the place for it. I always think more lightly of these little truth=telling papers than of the big lying, or at least conventional journals. Glad to hear always of yr health, Walt, or rather no health. My mind is fallow now, but I suffer it is for the best. I hardly know my old self as seen in my old Index articles. However, Sursum! Resurgam! Forward! Am reading a pocket Shakspere, nothing like a pocket ed. of a writer.I do a good many editorial jottings and review Belmont theatricals always for Transcript. We have had a magic ice-spectacle hereâ€”trees all candied. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 19 January 1891"
