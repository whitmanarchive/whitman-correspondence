    "text": "Esopus, N.Y.Aug. 10, 77Dear Walt,I am back only a few days from a 3 weeks trip to Canada. The morning after my return some wretch poisoned my dog & the loss has quite up setupset me. I have not been my selfmyself since. Then I am out of sorts in body & wife is away under the doctors care, so that I am not having a very good time. We traveled—Mr. Johns & me—about 2300 miles, & excepting a week spent in the woods north of Quebec, the trip was a good deal of a bore. We went by way of Boston & I ran about there some, I called on Gurnsey[Guernsey] of the Boston Herald & found him a very likable young man—in fact a thoroughly good fellow. He said he had written to you, but had recd no reply yet. I told him you were probably away in the country. I liked the looks of Boston much. We poked about Cambridge some & then went over to Concord & passed a night there. I found Mr Sanborn & was cordially recd. I had seen him the day before in Boston. I like Sanborn all except his lofty coldness & reserve. It seems to be the style out there to affect ignorance of every thing you are interested in He showed us the home & some of the haunts of Thoreau, & then his grave & that of Hawthorne. He took me to see Alcott whom I liked. Alcott praised my Emerson piece, but Sanborn appeared not to know anything about my writings. We were at Alcotts only a few minutes. He spoke in a friendly way about you &c. We passed by Emersons house & I admired his wood pile, I did not feel like calling upon him of my own motion. Alcott said he was well. I liked Concord, but I don't see how any great thing can come out of that place.I got the Library Table with Blood's sanguinary review of my book. It is very petty criticism & I think I can stand it better than Blood can. He evidently wanted to pitch into my Eagle, but was afraid of the claws. I hope I shall see you soon, as I must go to W. this month unless the heat is too oppressive. Write me how & where you are.Ever YoursJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 10 August 1877"
