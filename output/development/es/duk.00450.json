    "text": "StudioAug 28, 1890Dear Bro Walt,Lou and Jessie came here yesterday—I assure you I was gratefull[grateful]—They took hold immediately with an energy that has advanced household comfort, in one day, than I could have accomplished perhaps all winter—brought a woman in the house with mop and pail, and scoured the floor, alleviating all that stale, dusty, misty atmosphere—drew out a carpet kept in reserve, and we put it down—Lou engineering—to a line—then she went away and returned having purchased a new carpet for Han's sleeping rooms, and had a stove for winters use set up—bought an arm chair, a pair of shades, and had the oldold lounge or sofa taken away to be repaird[repaired] in the best possible manner, but a matrass[mattress] for me, cotton and stuff—better perhaps than I had—the stove was put in place in our best room—a good heater. The women worked, and so did I, until the best shirt I had was ript[ripped], in rags—I told Lou that I had no other—true—she told Han that she had intended to have given her some money but could not—she had none left.I wished that she had left 25 dollars for the taxes—but alas—numerous persons have contributed, a dollar occasionaly[occasionally], to keep us up—beside your kind remittances—Oh! good friend Walt. Han is pretty well—Yours gratefully—Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1890"
