    "text": "535, 15th St WashOct 6th/74Mr. WhitmanDear SirI regret very much that I am obliged to write to you again, but as I am very much in need of some money just as soon as possible I thought perhaps you would be willing to settle up your bill if you do you will greatly oblige me we have nearly two hundred & fifty dollars besides the regular expenses to pay within the next twenty days so you will see that we will need all that we can make or get that is due us. Your bill was up to the first of August thirty eight dollars ($38.00) I am willing to give you ten dollars ($10.00) for the things which I took from you that is nearly as much as they would cost if new and as much as they are worth to me. Then you will still owe twenty eight ($28.00) which if you could let me have this week will be a great favorâ€”Of course I will not charge you for keeping your things since, but I would be glad if you would have them removed soonYours RespectfullyMrs Isabella A White Isabella A. White to Walt Whitman, 6 October 1874"
