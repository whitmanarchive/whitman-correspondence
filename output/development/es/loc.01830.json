    "text": "New Castle, Pa.July 17.My Dear Walt:You have, I believe, in your hands certain charges against Judge Kelly of Idaho. His friends are my friends, and while I do not know much of him personally, I nevertheless know his accuser, Delegate Holbrook, to be a very bad manâ€”one of the worst in the territory. It seems to me that nothing good or proper can come out of him. Do not misunderstand me, but if you can do anything for Judge K. to aid him, without compromising your duty, you will be doing me a favor.I congratulate you, my dear fellow, on the great appreciation which reaches across the greatwater to shake your hand. Your time is coming. The world is getting to be enlightened. I am already, in a worldly way, as I am in a spiritual way, pious to be consideredYour friendH. J. Ramsdell Hiram J. Ramsdell to Walt Whitman, 17 July 1867"
