    "text": "SyracuseOctober 6th/68Dear FriendWalt WhitmanI have neglected to answer your last letter so long that I am most ashamed to write to you now but I know that you will excuse my seeming neglect for I have been very busy for the past three months.This letter will be handed to you by our esteemed Friend Miss Kate C Riley of Washington who I would like to introduce to you. We made her acquaintance at the same time we did yours and under the same circumstance, performing acts of kindness to Sick & wounded Soldiers. She has made us several flying visits this summer & I have taken the liberty of sending you this letter of Introduction by her.She can talk to you about David & myself from having seen us lately. My little baby Walt is well & Bright as a dollar. with Love to yourself I will close for the present.Please write SoonYour FriendB.H. Wilson.Benton WilsonOct. 6 1868(Rec'd Dec. 10) Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 6 October 1868"
