    "text": "Washington, March 3, 1868. Messrs. Church.Dear Sirs:I sent you \"Personalism\"—which I suppose you received Monday last. I should consider it a favor from you to have the piece set up as soon as convenient, first proof carefully read & corrected, & then three sets of proofs taken & mailed me here—One set I will read, and return immediately.I think of offering the article in England, probably to the Fortnightly Review—but of course any thing over there must be strictly subordinated to the appearance of the article here first—that is positive.Can you let me have the proofs within a week or so?I think of asking you $100 for \"Personalism.\" I reserve the right of printing it in future book.How about the little piece \"Ethiopia Commenting\"? Will it not be practicable for you to print it in the April number? Certain poetical pieces of mine were arranged to appear soon in English magazine & I should like the \"Ethiopia\" to precede them.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Francis P. Church and William C. Church, 3 March 1868"
