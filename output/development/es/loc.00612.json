    "text": "SyracuseDec 9th/66Walt WhitmanDear old Friend,I wrote to you a long time ago and received one letter from you but when I wrote again I received no answer and supposed you had not received my letter and I thought I would write you a few lines again and see if you had not forgotten me. I would try to make myself one of your correspondents for I would really like to hear from you very much for I formed an attachment for you during my short stay in washington[Washington] (and at the hospital) that I would like to perpetuate it.I do not know your present address but shall address this the same as I did the last one I wrote to you.My Friend Hamilton started for Leavenworth Kansas last week to see his Brother, who has been jammed up on the Rail Road, and had his leg amputated.I will not weary you with a very long letter this time but will wait till I get an answer to this and then I will try to do better.I am as every your sincere friendBenton H. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 9 December 1866"
