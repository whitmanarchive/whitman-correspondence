ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,11 Sept 1888Your letter of 8th which came to hand last evening gave me great pleasure for I judged by the tone of it that you are decidedly better than you have been since that bad turn in June. If you can only hold your grip now! I am glad you have at last sold the horse & phaetonâ€”it is much better so. Yes, I do not know what we should all do without Horace he is a grand fellow and sticks to his guns like an old soldier. Nothing new here about meter or anything else.Love to you,RM BuckeSee notes Sept. 13 '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 September 1888"
