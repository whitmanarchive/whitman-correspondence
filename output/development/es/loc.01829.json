    "text": "Wednesday, May 8, 1867My Dear Waltâ€”I have called several times to say that I have recdreceived a letter from Mr. Townsend. In it he refers to you and your \"Leaves\" as follows: \"Tell Walt Whitman that I felt myself after reading the preface to his book in the presence of a stupendous genius, like a man before Aep suddenly. I read the rest of it on the vast as its conception. There is a noble acorn in it, and a availability. It is the song of a God, with a broadaxe in his hand, opening a Broadway in the setting sun.\"I am off for New Castle, Pa for the summer, and I hope you will write me there. I shall expect it.Thine EverH. J. Ramsdell Hiram J. Ramsdell to Walt Whitman, 8 May 1867"
