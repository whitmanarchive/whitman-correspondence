We are having some lovely weather here now—Indian Summer—the most delightfull season of the whole year if it was not so uncertain and evanescent.Nothing more from Gurd—Cannot possibly get away not before the middle or End of next week and maybe not then. I have no doubt all is right but the delay and uncertainty are unpleasant. Glad to see that the big book keeps sailing along—hope it will be in some kind of shape by the time I get downI think I told you that Rolleston had sent me his new vol. Epictetus Have not looked into it much yet—no time—but how modern some of it is—for instance Chap. XI BK ii—that will bear studying still.Love to youR M BuckeSee notes Nov. 16 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 14 November 1888"
