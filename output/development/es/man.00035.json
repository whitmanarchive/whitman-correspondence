    "text": "25, CHESHAM STREET.S.W.15 June 1880My dear FriendYou see I venture to salute you, & to write to you in the same strain as that in which you so kindly addressed me in your letter of 26 May, & which I was vyvery glad to receive. I did get your Riddle Song, & was very pleased indeed to have it, & now I have your tribute to Emerson, which is exceedingly interesting. It is pleasant to see you all rallying round the grand old man of letters, but more than of letters.Alfred Tennyson left England about a week ago, for Venice, & he will probably be absent for a month or more. but he shall have the paper on Emerson, & anything else you forward me, directly he returns.Tennyson has two country houses, & some people might say \"therefore no home\"! One is \"Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight,\" where he abides for about seven months in the year, the winter especially—& the other is \"Aldworth, Haslemere, Surrey\", where he spends nearly four months of the summer, & he is usually a month or five weeks in London, in the Early Spring.I think you must send me anything you would like him to have, & I will make it a duty, as well as a pleasure, to send it on to him at once.His son, & my son-in-law, Lionel Tennyson, lives in London for some ten months out of the twelve, at 4 Sussex Place, Regents Park, N.W.I do know Mrs. Gilchrist. She is re-editing the Life of Blake, & I have a few of his letters, & she has been once or twice in my house to copy them for her book. I am not surprised that you are attached to her. She seemed to me most interesting and intelligent—& it is a great thing to be intelligent, is not it?I am much interested to hear how you live & feel, taking life cheerfully. I wish we could clasp hands and talk of many matters. Spiritual as well as temporal. but there is a great callous Atlantic betwixt us. but I daresay you would hardly allow that the Atlantic was callous!Yours am most trulyF. LockerCamden, New Jersey, U.S.A. Frederick Locker-Lampson to Walt Whitman, 15 June 1880"
