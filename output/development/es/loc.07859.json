    "text": "Camden NJ1890Monday night—Dec 8Horace has been here back from his brief N Y trip—he saw Ingersoll at I's splendid Wall st offices, surrounded with his clerks & Mr Baker, & had a long talk, varied & animated & interesting—was at (Jeweler) Johnston's—staid there—had good confabs & good meals there—went to the Ethical Convention &c&c&c—I am sitting here alone—had my supper two hours ago—mostly vegetables & cup of tea—am feeling middling comfortable—cold weather—snow, rain & mist—financial failures these days—but I believe the experts here don't feel generally alarmed—Have just had a good icy cup of sweet milk bro't to me wh' I am drinking slowly at intervals as I write—the sound of the RR cars on the track next street, and a half-muffled whistling in the snow—A M Dec: 9—Sun shining—west wind—snow on ground—some toast & tea for breakfast—sent off proof of obituary of my dear bro: Jeff to N Y Engineering Record (will send you one when printed)—did you get Critic of Nov. 29? Or shall I send you mine? Talcott Williams (Phil: Press) had a stenographer there at Reisser's evn'g May 31 '89, & took down the conversation bet'n Ingersoll and self (ab't immortality &c) after supper it seems—& is now typewriting it out & to send me copies, one of wh' I will surely forward to you soon as he does—have just got a letter f'm Johnston N Y, buying a big book enc: the money—enough bellyache to signify itself (indigestion mainly I guess)—noon & early afternoon fine out but bad traveling—What is this I hear ab't some one in Phila: (at some bust there anent of me) giving him (Johnston N Y) $10 to hand me?—how was it?—bowel motions but slow & hard & sluggish—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 8-9 December 1890"
