    "text": "Belmont MassJuly 18 '86Dear WW. Letters rec'dreceived & read, & whatever news &c that might properly be taken from a private letter, absorbed & noted for me. The Dowden quotation I had lighted on myself before, & use it as motto to chapter. The letters form the young man are extremely interesting.

Receive congratulations on yryour trip to Jersey shore, which I envy you. As everWS KennedyDIED IN THE ARMYThe number of deaths that occurred in the Union armies during the slavery war is a question which has been widely discussed ever since the collapse of the Confederacy. Many efforts were made to obtain reliable statistics, and each the investigations have brought inquires closer to be the correct figures. The \" researches was undertaken something General Richard C. Drum, who entrusted to Mr. J. W. Kirkley the important work. That gentleman had the assistance of a number of competent clerks, and a minute and exhaustive investigation was made of all official documents that could be found. The results have just been published, and a valuable addition to war history. The period covered by the record is, for the regular troops, from April 15, 1861, to August 1, 1865; for a portion of the volunteers it is prolonged beyond the last-mentioned date until the mustering out of each organization. The last white volunteer organization was disbanded November 18, 1867, and the last colored regiment December 20, 1867, and the last officer of the volunteer general staff was not mustered out until July 1, 1869. The report shows that the aggregate of deaths among the Union forces of 359,496, of which 9,584 were commissioned officers and 349,912 were enlisted men. In detail these figures were distributed as follows:—Killed or died, of wounds, 110,; died of disease, 224,586, drowned and other accidental deaths, 4,114; murdered, 524, after capture, 100; committed suicide, 391; executed, 267; executed by the enemy, 64; died form sunstroke, 313; other known causes, 2,034; causes not stated, 12,121. The \"other known causes\" include deaths resulting from quarrels not amounting to murder, form being shot by sentries by the provost guard, and miscellaneous causes. In these figures it is noticed that the death registers of some of the largest prisons at the South in which Union soldiers were confined are missing, such as the prisons at Americus, Atlanta, Augusta, Charleston, Lynehburg, Macon, Marietta, Mobile, Montgomery, Savannah, Shreveport, and Tyler; and only partial reports are given from Calawba, Columbia, Florence, S. C. Millen, and Salisbury. It is known that 29,498 Union soldiers died in captivity, while in many instances three or four bodies of Union prisoners were interred in the grave or trench. The New England are represented by 40,080 recorded ; New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, 85,531; the Western States by 142,489; Missouri, Delaware, Tennessee, and West Virginia, 39,607; from the Pacific States and Territories, including California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington Territory, Dakotah, New Mexico, and Colorado, 7,297; and 3,854 from States included in the Confederacy. It is also observed that 36,847 deaths occurred among the colored troops, 5,798 in the regular army, among the Indian tribes, and 3, among miscellaneous organizations. In addition to bearing testimony of the good conduct of the Union officers as a whole —nd fewer than 6,365 of whom were killed in action or died of wounds—the report contains many important and interesting details. The State of Illinois lost 34,834 men, of whom 1,948 died in Rebel prison pens; Indiana, 4,753; Minnesota, 2,584; Nebraska, 239; Ohio, 35,475; Wisconsin, 12,301. Taking the three most important causes, we find that 4,142 officers and 62,896 men were killed in action; 2,223 officers and 40,777 men died of wounds and 2,795 officers and 221,791 men died of disease. Among the enlisted men 30 per cent. of the total deaths were of those killed by the enemy, and 66⅔ per cent. of the officers form the same cause. Among the men 63 per cent of the deaths were occasioned by disease. WAR FATALITSome curious conclusions are Medical Record from the statistics Army losses during the war. Thdiers killed in battle was 67,030,\" of the whole number enlisted, wounds 43,000, or 1.85 per cent of 110,030 deaths from violence. On the other hand, the deaths 224,586, or 9.68 per cent., showing was twice as fatal as the bullet. still, however, is the fact that the death-rate in this country in time little less than the death-rate from of war—and so the lost in the ing the Confederate War was than would have occurred in the but to the chance of being killed the far greater risk from disease, figures of mortality were increased which at first glance seem so William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 18 July 1886"
