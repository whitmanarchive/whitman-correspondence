    "text": "Sent a paper—slips—& MemMemoranda Aug 10 '76Copenhagen24th of July 1876My dear Walt Whitman.Being totally without news from you since January this year I began to fear, that you may be severely ill; else I presume, that you would have let me hear from you, at least by papers and little parcels as ordinary I wrote to you in April a fortnight before my marriage. If the letter should not have reached you, I hereby tell you, that of the 14,th May I married my dear faithfullfaithful little wife, to whom I have been betrothed since inne years. I am a living example of the old sentence, that riches are no ingredient of happiness.If you have dearly received my letter from April, you will know, that I have made vain and to myself very humiliating efforts to arrange a demonstration in favour of you among the labor of CopenhagenMy thoughts were with on the 4th. Your name most surely has the best glamour to be memorable at \"the Centennial\"; most probably it has not been it at all.I think to write another about George Washington. Should you know one good memoirs and relations of contemporaries about the Anglo-American work?My dear wife is greeting you as a friend. Your kind earnest face is looking on us in this moment from our wall.Tomorrow I dare reach the age of forty years!I should be glad if these lines may meet you in good health and good laughsYours—Rudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 24 July 1876"
