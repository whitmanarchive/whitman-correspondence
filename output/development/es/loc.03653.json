    "text": "Private51 Upper Gloucester PlaceDorset SqLondon.18th April.My dear friend,I have recdreceived your postal handshake, and am glad to find that you appreciate my motives in writing to the English public on your behalf. Whatever comes of the appeal, nothing but good to you can come from this increased knowledge of you among general readers here; and that your apotheosis is at hand is abtabout as certain as that the sun shines and that great Love lives for ever. Every day widens your circle; every year sows your great seed deeper & deeper in the hearts of men.You will already have heard from William Rossetti how he has thriven on your behalf. My second letter naturally turned the tide of contributions in his direction, as I desired, deeming him your very good friend, as indeed he seems to be! I am sending out, however, some ₤25 (particulars in other letter), including ₤5 from Tennyson, which came to me before I could answer Rossetti's letter. Since then Moncure Conway has denied authoritavely that you wanted money, & I have been waiting & wondering what to do. From your letters (which Rossetti has sent me for perusal) I pretty well perceive how matters stand, & had, though not in actual pricking want, you really need and ought to have more money. Owing to the contradictions afloat, I have delayed putting your case before personal friends, & the few friends I send are simply they tokens from the general public.You must forgive me for my blunder abtabout the price of your books. The result proves that very many people who admire you here cant afford such a high price as 2 guineas, & you will therefore have to be content with a smaller circle of subscribers than you would otherwise get.What I want you to tell me forthwith is how far the sum already gathered between Rossetti & myself—say ₤50 or so in all—will go to make you temporarily comfortable? There will doubtless be a heavy deduction in the cost of buying out your Beautiful Edition. But query, will the sum already gathered keep you going tolerably while other subscriptions are \"dribbling\" in? I wish I were a rich man—I am only an author living by his pen—and you should certainly never want anything your heart craved; but all I can do in my small way is to sing your praises wherever I can. (By the way, I enclose you a portion of the Gentleman's Magazine, with another letter of mine).I can conceive you trailing superbly as you survey the gnats of American primalism now hovering round your head. Thanks for your papers. When people become abusive, they have been touched to the quick, & I am sure the community will do you good.It is with true grief that I read of your sorry health. Will you believe it, I had never heard of your condition until I read these from the New Jersey Paper? Had I known of it sooner, you would certainly have heard from me—or even seen me—long ago. A year or two ago I had some correspondence with E. C. Stedman concerning you; and as far as I can gather, he is most hostile to your poetic claims. I found argument in vain, & desisted. Stedman is a clever versewriter, without backbone or vice; & there are many like him here & even with you; but believe me, such men do not truly represent even the average intelligence of students, and your circle of readers is in the above their heads.It is now a daily dream with me to see you & know you, for ever so short a time, in the flesh. Whether or not that honour & delight will be granted me, I shall never think of you but with love and honour, never speak or write of you without homage. Be happy, Whitman, in the severe certainty that you have fulfilled your life, & spoken—in times no thunder can silence—the beautiful message you were fashioned to bring!Ever yoursRobert BuchananWalt Whitman.Write to me as soon as convenient, & let me know, in & deepest confidence, exactly how far the present \"little\" will help you, & what will make you comfortable for the future. Robert Buchanan to Walt Whitman, 18 April [1876]"
