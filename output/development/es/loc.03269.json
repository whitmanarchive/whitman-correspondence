    "text": "Opera House Pittsburgh PaDec 17th 1886. Dear Mr Whitman At last I match half an hour from the everlasting sound of socalledso-called business for something real something pleasant. The sight even of your name above bring a healthy puff of honest air into my stuffy little cabin. Here saw at the other end of grand old Pennsylvania in a dusky town of iron & smoke. Rude nature seems to have born a rude race of sons and given them a share of her unconscious honesty & self forgetful beauty. Here I am sure enough but my thoughts & what I fancy the best part of my self are with you in your cozy study at Camden. My first thought is, how are you in body and nerves? Well? I hope, at the very least better! I'll answer for it you are well enough in mind. The mere sight of your cheery card humour and the mind contuse with your grand philosophy of good will bring peace and hope. They brought them to a very tough youngster whose worth is horribly twisted by the bitter herb of Sardinia: that galling flavor of time & talents wasted that is in my every waking sleeping thought. Bah! you will say what is the matter with the boy that he should write me all this taffy. Quite true! for if I were to spoil means I could only say again and ever again, \"I have seen \"Walt Whitman\" & I know what \"comradeship\" is!\" At this Xmas season it is our custom to send greeting. At all time my fond wishes are for your health & happiness & for that other never to be named Nirvana you giant seers strive after. Heartiest greeting for Xmas & many many happy New Years to all your home circle, not omitting the happy little canary from yours faithfullyGerald Maxwell Mem: We are at Columbia Theatre Chicago 20th just till Jan 8th.
