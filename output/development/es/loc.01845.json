    "text": "Meltonsville AlabamaJuly/75Walt Whitman—Dear Friend!I begin this letter at 11 A. M. Sunday July —sitting in the extral, airy hall an apo itting room common to the ed log buildings which form so common a style of residences of the moderately \"well off\" Southerners—especially of my section, where saw-mills have not been so plentiful as to favor the building frame houses, and most efforts in bried-burning have succeeded badly—producing a very sorry article. (I have not determined, before sitting down, when I will finish this and send it on.) The sun is shining bright. This is a tolerably flat level place—convenient for getting about. I out eastward through an orchard of low top Apple and trees. Three hundred yards from house, runs north eastwardly and south westwardly, , or line of more or less closely joined knobs, hills, or short transverse ridges about 150 feet high. The ridge runs parallel with the big river and ally divides our valley into a sandstone sub valley nex broad but low Sand mountain; and a b-vall lime land next the ri. Looking h sta new r appchingtly stopped erged ar growth owing ickonggestion of the present of the great s 14 mts. whose grandeur would seriously passed mile long isling lobil except tillers pts; diving th and gives only about ts vol to share. So, while our hois ch if at all injured by malaria nd y convenient, and is as I call it a mig handy to bread and meat \"we yet have not dire from the house any very vely outlook But a inutes travel brings us to parts even in the level from which the prospects have a quiet or gent loveliness. A mountain range north of the river coming right in front of me for two or three miles close to the river and giving back a little right and left presents with its top and side green or blue according to season) a pleasing boundary to the landscape. In the other sub-valley (my term) the big, broad mountain and gentle undulations of the valley itself present varying pleasing or soothing scenes. Yet you know mountains whose biggast might be an elevation of only feet cant[can't] a striking or awe-inspiring appearance to any landscape. Most people here live in log houses—a very few years back, we have partly used wooden and earthen chimneys, as good stone (that we knew to be such) was not very plentiful about the surface, and nobody undertook to mine fort and then use several fon brickmaking, Later though has been trying wn sandstone then out stone aneely dress a put up.

This valley of two valleys is 10 mi long iles wide—contains haps 150 grown men The Nes are mostly in tlusters about two or three miles northeast and southwest of my home—they et and well behaved—perhaps the grown males of the negroes would want 30 or 40. Our people are very plain or Democratic in ways—no aristocracy—little crime—the religious part are old orthodox Baptists and Methodists. Most of our better educated people are inclined to skpeticism, but don't dispute much with the other class so far as I know. (All the above I have written because your letter of July 13 seems for such sketches. I cant[can't] get a good pen point. It would take something like a book to deal with all the subjects you open for me.)I had one only brother two years older—in a former letter I said when he was a boy or very young man he was \"rude and repellent\"—that only meant his ly fault was a teasing & jeering provok way that made me fear often hat haffection was steady and unreliable.

His home was somewhat isolated—probably he lived among his slaves and a few \"retainers\" of whit much like a Scottish Chieftain—yet he was not righteous nor a conformist thothough transmitting to his heirs his t goos, generosity, and time,)Little Walt is perhaps \"small\" only alacks the draw ous flesh hasgh—started out reformer rather —week ac he commenced moved himself into a room a jug of whiskey which I was only treating neigh workmen at threshing time.
