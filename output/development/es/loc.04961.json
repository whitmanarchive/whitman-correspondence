Novbr 1890Dear Walt Whitman,This morning I received from Dr Johnston a copy of the current number of \"Great Thoughts\" (containing a short article on yourself) and a note in which he told me of his intention to send a copy to you. In the same paper I found copies of two beautiful letters by Carlyle which I have not previously met with.â€”As you may possibly overlook them, and as one will be of special interest to you, I will cut it out and enclose it with this.I have no time now for more, but, with love always, remainYours affectionatelyJ. W. Wallace J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 18 November 1890"
