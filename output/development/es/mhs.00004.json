    "text": "Near Lancaster Ky May 15th 1863Dear Brother Jeff,I believe I last wrote home from Lowell, but a fellow has to change about so often in this country, its hard work to remember where he was two days ago.After staying at Lowell a couple of days we were ordered to pack up and move again, so we started back on the same road we went out on, and encamped about a mile from this place. After stopping there two days, our Regt was ordered down to this Villiage to do Provost duty in the Town. Lancaster is a small one horse specimen of a southren[southern] Villiage, about 32 miles from Lexington, in the central part of the state and 16 or 18 miles from any railroad communication. The country about here is splendid. the fruit trees are just now in full bloom  the weather is fine,  we are liveing[living] first rate  the men are all in good health, and we are haveing[having] a good time generaly[generally]. Our Regt is now encamped on the outskirts of the Town in a nice shady spot all alone by ourselvs[ourselves], the rest of our Brigade and the First Brigade of our Division being encamped about a mile out of Town. We have everything comfortable here, but I think I already see signs of moveing[moving], and it wont be many days before we will have to pull up stakes and be off. We have been very much disapointed[disappointed] in the result of the fighting on the Rappahannock,  we had such favorable news from there at first, and Hooker managed things so nicely in crossing the river, and getting a good position, that I about made up my mind, that notwithstanding the bad luck, that has always attended the movements of the Potomac Army, it was about to do a big thing and I was almost sorry I wasent[wan't] there to have a hand in. The account of the takeing[taking] of Richmond too was firmly believed here, as Gen Sturgisrecd. a Tel Dix (said to be from Gen Burnside) saying that Gen Dix had advanced by way of Petersburg and that Richmond was certainly in our posession[possession],  A few hours after the dispatch was recd, there came another from the same source confirming the first, and although I had not believed the news at first, I finaly[finally] began to think there must be some truth in it. And then to find out that we had not only not, taken Richmond, but that Hooker had been obliged to recross the river, was a terrible let down I can tell you. Still I have faith in Hooker and believe he will yet do something big, and takeing[taking] into account the many disadvantges[disadvantages] he had to contend with, (the storm and the devilish cowardice of the Dutchman of the 11th Corps) I dont[don't] know as any other man could have done better than he. One thing I think is plain, in crossing the river and getting in the rear of Lee's army in the manner he did, Hooker showed fine generalship and altogather[altogether], I think more of him than I did before the fight.Well Jeff how are you all getting along at home. I dont[don't] hear from you very often, not as often as I should like to. I hope Mother and Mattie and Sis and all the rest of you are well. Walt says that Mother is still troubled sometimes, with the Rheumatism,  does she take sulphor[sulfur] baths  Walt said he was going to make arrangements for her to do so. Why not have a bath rigged up in her room,  it would not cost much, and would save the journey down to Perceys. Andrew, Walt says is working in the Navy Yard, so I suppose he must be better. I hear from Walt quite often,  he seems to be getting along very well. Have you heard from Hannah lately. when you get a letter from her, send it on so that I can see it. There has been nothing done in regard to consolidating our Regt. yet. I think likely they will wait untill[until] the draft goes into opperation[operation] and then fill us up with conscripts.Direct your letters Department of Ohio and no matter where the Regt may be the letters will come all right. Good bye Jeff  Much love to Mother, Mattie, Hattie, and allG. W. Whitman George Washington Whitman to Thomas Jefferson Whitman, 15 May 1863"
