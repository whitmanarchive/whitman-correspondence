    "text": "Anesley ParkS.E.LondonMay 16 1886Dear Sir, I am so sorry to hear of your illness! And very sorry to hear the book has not reached you. I have now told my publisher to send another copy to your correct address. I shall be glad to hear you are not dissatisfied with the essay on yourself. I formerly sent you some of my poetry, but it was early work. I hope I have been getting on since, & have now got a place perhaps as permanent as this sort of thing can be!—among our poets—though I am not popular here, or in America. I could wish to be more known in America.I am glad that you are at last taking your rightful place among the best. My debt to you is great. Would that I could express it in person! I have often said the chief (if not the only) reason why I want to go to America is to see Niagara, the Yosemite, & Walt Whitman! You did send me your works, & I value the present not a little. But I was sorry to see Dr Bucke did not mention me among your early admirers, for I published in \"Dark Blue\" (an essay you & Mr Burroughs liked) long ago (this one is an enlarged republication of that).Processing the fine \"Democratic Vistas\" & \"Sketches during the war\" &c . Yours with sincere respect,Roden Noel. I venture to send a photo of myself in return for some you sent me of yourself formerly. I'll send a copy too of my last book, \"Songs of the Heights & Deeps\"see notes June 28 1888Roden Noel Roden Noel to Walt Whitman, 16 May 1886"
