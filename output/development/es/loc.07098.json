    "text": "2041 Chestnut Street,Philadelphia.April 12/90Dear Friend:It is difficult to express the gratification I have felt in looking over the pages of the volume you so kindly sent me. These pages mirror a life, and the meaning of a lifeâ€”rather should I say, not a life, but life, for the lines which fill them express, not particulars, but universals. On this account, future generations will not let die the contents of this book; and that I have it from him who wrote it is a peculiar pleasure to me. Believe me.Most gratefully yoursD. G. BrintonToWalt Whitman. Daniel Garrison Brinton to Walt Whitman, 12 April 1890"
