Well, mother, it's over at last with dear Matty—I got a dispatch of her death on the evening of the 19th—I suppose you have too, of course—It must have been a relief from very great suffering, as Jeff's letters of late described it— poor dear sister, she has many real mourners—I have just written to Han about it— I am about the same—rather better— Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 20 February [1873]"
