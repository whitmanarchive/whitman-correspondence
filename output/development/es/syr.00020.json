    "text": "Washington, D.C.March 7, 1885.Dear Walt: I sent you today by express the picture of Lord Bacon by Vandyck I mentioned some little time ago. I hope you will like it. It is the only picture of Bacon I ever saw without the hat. I felt surer than ever when I saw that Olympian forehead that this was the author of Shakespeare. I wish the picture was a steel engraving, instead of wood, but it was the only one eligible. Give it a place on your wall. The Manhattan is going to be revived shortly and is to print my paper, called \"Hamlet's Note-Book\", the one giving R. G. White a going over, of which I wrote you some time ago. The editor writes me a letter so unqualified in panegyric of the article that I am astonished. I am just having a temporary respite from the worst spell of work ever laid on me. Soon it will begin again. Faithfully,W.D. O'Connor.Walt Whitman. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 7 March 1885"
