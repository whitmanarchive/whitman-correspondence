    "text": "Sunday, August 11th/67My dear WaltI received your letter and was right glad to get it I am in rather a writing mood today and have written a long letter to Han I also enclosed one from Jeff it was a very long and lively one and I thought it would please her. I am having very pleasant times here, sometimes, it is very gay, it it the style here when any one has company every one calls on them. tomorrow I have to return quite a number it is quite a bore to me to make fashionable calls but of course I must submit to it. but what I enjoy most of any thing else is sitting in my window looking down the SusquanhannaSusquehanna for miles and on the opposite side long ranges of the AllegannyAllegheny Mountains they are mostly cultivated and their is something delightful about the scenery I would never tire looking at it we have not had what I call a real hot day this summer the children are very happy and contented seldom talk about home they are very fat and burnt Hattie talks a good deal about seeing you, and says she is going out with Uncle Walt. I write to Mother quite often it seems to cheer her up to get letters, I tell her every little particular I have been to a number of picnics they are very pleasant. this week we expect to go to the Barclay coal mines every one around here seems related some way to Mr or Mrs Mason we also go riding a good deal the time passes quickly and I am much pleased that I decided to come here I expect to leave for Washington with Mary & Jule the 29th ins't Wont you come and me Walt before you leave for Brooklyn I want to see you very much about those \"Notes\" I would like much to have a copy but think it hardly worth while to send them here but you will save me a copy when I come to Washington I dont think of any more to write at present and it is getting late and I want yet to write one to Mother bidding you good night I remain your Affectionate sisterMattieI forgot to tell you the children said before they went to sleep to give their love to Uncle Walt Martha Whitman to Walt Whitman, 11 August 1867"
