    "text": "St. Louis.Feb. 15th 1880Mr WhitmanDear Sir I received your book and photograph, I thank you very much indeed for both of them. I have enjoyed reading your book very much as it gave me a very different opinion of the private soldier, from that which I before possessed. I received your book some three weeks ago when I was preparing for my half yearly examinations and as I was very busy I could not get time to read it and I didn't want to write until I had done so. Yours affectionatelyWilliam Mills William Mills to Walt Whitman, 15 February 1880"
