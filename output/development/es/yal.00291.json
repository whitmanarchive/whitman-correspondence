    "text": "Add Symonds Rudolf Schmidt Edw. Carpenter sent big books, too314 Mill StPo'keepsie N.Y.Feb 21, 89Dear Walt:Your letter was very welcome to me. Your hand-write looks as clear & strong as ever. I hope it really denotes that you are much better. The other night I read a long time in your \"Specimen Days\" & got myself into a very melancholy state of mind thinking of the old times, of all that Washington life of O'Connor & of that which never can come back. My life now seems very pale & poor compared with those days. There are but two things now from which I derive any satisfaction, Julian & that bit of land up there on the river bank where I indulge my inherited love for the soil. I have no comrades here. I probably never shall find any more. Julian is developing into a very happy, intelligent boy, full of enthusiasms, full of curiosity, & is about my only companion. He goes to school here & carries himself well.I am greatly distressed at what you tell me about O'Connor, and one must stand by powerless to render any aid! I hope I can see my way to go to W again to see him.I shall not stay here in P. much longer. I am getting enough of boarding house life. I shall go back home by March, but Mrs B & Julian will stay here. I had a letter from Horace this morning. The book may be sent to me at West Park, & let me thank you in advance for it. Tell Horace the essays I am thinking of putting in a vol. are old ones that have appeared in the magazines from time to time. What of Gilchrist? When you write again tell me what you know of his doings. Bright days here & sharp, with ice boating in the river.With the old loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 21 February 1889"
