    "text": "CamdenSunday P M Feb 10Dear HarryAt the request of your mother & from what you wrote some time ago I bundled up all the old letters I could find, & Edward Stafford stopt here & took them to her—this is over a week ago, (Ed still comes up here to school in Phila. to learn bookkeeping)—I believe your folks are all as usual—but I suppose you have heard from there, latest particulars. I am jogging along pretty much the same as ever—was to the theatre last week, & enjoyed it, \"Francesca da Rimini\"—lots of love-making & hugging in the play, done first rate—I quite fell in love with the lady actress (Mary Wainwright)—the actors spied me in front, & sent around to ask me to come behind the scenes, which I did at the end of the play, & was made much of, especially by Barrett the star—was invited to go with him to the Continental to supper—which I declined— I am doing a little in writing—have a little poem in Harpers for March, forthcoming, which I will send you—(I sent you the Indian piece, I believe)—When you get ready to go on further, or to any Western city, or anywhere, I will furnish you with a general letter of recommendation, if you wish it—may serve to break the ice, possibly, somewhere. I suppose you get the Camden & other papers I send— For over a month now we have had rough winter weather here—lately rain & fog, most a week—but to-day is bright & fine—I am sitting up in the 3d story room, Stevens street, in the afternoon sun writing this—Glad you write to me in such good spirits, & are well—they two are every thing—Keep on—explore the big western cities, Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis—Denver—even to California—it will do you good to see the actual world, & men & affairs—God bless you, dear boy—W W Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 10 February 1884"
