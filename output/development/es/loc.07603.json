    "text": "The Union League ClubNew York,21st May, '88.My dear Walt Whitman,I have just been reading your lines in the \"Herald\" for this morning, which hold in them a message full of meaning for all of us who know you well. We think of your approaching birthday with sorrowful, & yet glad, remembrance of the years that you have lived so well.My adventures since leaving you have not been very startling, but they have been full of everyday life and energy. Here in 5th Avenue, or more often in Broadway & the less-known haunts, I have been seeing all sorts of memorable things & men & women. Yesterday my good friend Cyrus Butler, a kind & wealthy old gentleman, took me quite a round of studios, &c. We began by breakfasting sumptuously here, (fried shad, omelettes, tomatoes, buckwheat cakes, strawberries, coffee, &c.) & then turned in to see Col. Bob Ingersoll, meeting there Lawrence Barrett the actor, & others. Then onto Beard's studios, &c. Over to Brooklyn to see a crazy rhymester,â€”winding up again by having supper near midnight.To-day promises to be even more memorable, I expect to start up the Hudson River by the Mary Powell (fastest boat in the world, they say!) & then to catch a late train up at Newburgh on to Buffalo, &c. Thence to Dr. Bucke's place on Wednesday, where I will look to send you a further note on my doings.I have good news of my brother at last, & so am free to sail for England in a fortnight.With love,Ernest Rhys. Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 21 May 1888"
