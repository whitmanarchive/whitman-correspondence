Dearest mother,I have just rec'd your short letter of yesterday—Mother, I feel so bad, you are not well, I don't know what to do—will not rest, and some food that suits, be good remedies? An old person wants the most favorable conditions, to get over any thing. Mother, I will come on about the 1st of next month—I am getting along favorably, they all say, but have frequent distress in my head, & my leg is clumsy as ever—I am writing this in the office at my desk—I send some papers to-day—nothing particular in them—but I think the English paper, the Sunderland Times, good reading—Mother, write, if perfectly convenient, either Friday or Saturday, as I am anxious about you—Good bye, dearest mother, & keep up a good heart—Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 7 May [1873]"
