    "text": "May 20 1873Cousin WaltI presume you will be a little surprised when you open this letter—and will cast your eyes down at the end of it before you read it to see the writers name, but I received a letter from your Mother telling me of your very severe illness in wich[which] you have our Heartfelt sympathy (Barth, my Husband, and myself) your Mother asked me to write to you & write about any thing she says will interest youNow Cousin I hardly know what to write—there are many things of interest I could write about—But to write to one who has so much knowledge and intellect I am afraid you will think but a very poor hand at it—and the trouble with cousin Sarah she writes her letters so plainly—you must excuse my simple way of writing you (now there is something that interests me just now and I will tell you all about––it is to take place this month to of my one to be memorized one your Mother knowing Mr Olivers' daughter of Brooklyn from your old neighborhood the other lives at Binghampton Dr. Griffen's daughter you may have heard of him he had charge of one of the hospital at drawing the men two model wifes that can grace the parlor or grace the kitchen (if need be) this is the kind of wife men in my opinion ought to look for not a doll to be looked at, I hope cousin if you live to get well you will look about and get such a one for a wife because you will meet just such a one in your old days I do not mean to say you are an old man bye[by] any means because I do not know how old you are (now do not suppose for a moment that I am a match maker (& no I am not) but I do feel sorry for old Bachelors) me think I see you lay this scribbles down with a remark: cousin Sarah must think I have a great deal of time to master it in reading this paper. But I have taken your Mother advice—I said I did not know what to write—her reply was any thing would charm you. Now I am fraid I have gone too far—but you must make all due allowance for me must you. I could have written a mans' sympathetic letter (But then my heart is so full of my own sad Afflictions) But nevertheless you have our sympathyJohn has just called my attention to a paragraph in the evening express, in wich[which] it speaks of your improved health I can assure you we are glad to hear that if is so now cousin Walter if you feel that you have time to answer this scribbleing[scribbling] I should think it a favor (can you read it I doubt if you can) you do not know perhaps I am left handed so you will please make all due allowances John wishes to be remembered to youtruly your cousinSarah Avery152 Henry stNew York Sarah Avery to Walt Whitman, 20 May 1873"
