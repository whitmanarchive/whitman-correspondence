    "text": "March 26. 1889.Dear Walt.I think every one of these dreadful attacks leaves William worse. He has not yet recovered his balance, & is all mixed in his mind. He is also very weak in body. He is very restless at times after the attack passes off. This last period did not seem so severe, & yet the result has been prolonged. It is most bad & pitiful, & I am glad you can't see him.with love—N. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 26 March 1889"
