    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,2d June 1883Dear WaltI have yours of 31st ult. Have written Forman as you suggest and have also written McKay (send you enclosed a copy of the letter that you may see plainly on what footing you are with him). If the book is published in London before it is pubdpublished in America I believe the copyright will be as safe as the bank of England. Archie Bremner is still here on the staff of \"Advertiser\"—The notice in the \"Press\" was very gratifying, hope you will send me any you can particularly the adverse ones—You do not say anything about sending copies as I asked you in my last, I take it for granted meantime that you will attend to this—and also that you will have balance of my ten copies sent me here soon as convenient—The weather here now is perfect and the grounds look better than I have ever seen them We are all well and send you loveR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 June 1883"
