    "text": "see notes Jul 21 1889S.S. \"Anchoria\" Anchor Line New YorkNov.November 17th./831883Dear Poet,I have been home and back again since I called upon you in Philadelphia last month. I often think of you and wish I could stay near you, that I might see and speak to you sometimes, however, I often read your poems and as Shelley has said, \"Poetry is the record of the greatest happiest moments, of our greatest and best minds.\" Therefore in reading your book I feel that I have that which is greatest in you, but the heart will often rebel against the most logical conclusion, and thus with me I would like to be near you sometimes. I have only one other friend who has the same power over me, and that is he of whom I told you in Halifax. I was rather amused (when I told some of my friends at home that I had seen you), at the ideas they seemed to have of my object in calling on you. Some thought it was simply because you were a great man, and they gave me addresses of several well known men in Literature &c. however, I told them these other men were not Walt Whitman and that the only others I would have crossed the Atlantic to see would have been Emerson and Thoreau both of whom are very dear to me.You may have forgotten all about me: indeed it would be surprising to find it otherwise; but it was not that you should know me, that I came, noâ€”I both knew & loved you before, but I wanted to see & speak to you. It might have been my friend as well as myself who called but I had the opportunity.I send you a book, that a friend in Glasgow, who is greatly taken with your \"Leaves of Grass\" asked me to send to you or take. I cannot very well leave my ship just now so I post it to you, he would have liked to have sent a more valuable book but he cannot afford it. I thought it very kind of him, I know he is a dear soft hearted fellow, and a splendid critic of English Literature. I will be here for 8 days, and I would like very much to know if you are well.I am glad to be able to tell you that your number of readers in Scotland is greatly increased. They are beginning to understand your teaching much betterI heard that Swinbourne ranks you third of living men. Victor Hugo I know is his great hero.Wish best wishesYours affectionately,T. F. Macdonald(Surgeon S.S. Anchoria)Walt WhitmanPhiladelphia T. F. Macdonald to Walt Whitman, 17 November 1883"
