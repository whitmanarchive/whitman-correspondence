    "text": "W.M. Rossetti on Swinburne5 ENDSLEIGH GARDENSN.W.16 Novr./86.Dear Sir,Your letter is full of kind & too-flattering expressions, to wh.which please believe that I am not insensible. If Chatto & Windus were by any probability to think fit to reprint the Criticism on Swinburne, I wdwould not have the least objection. It must be remembered however that the Criticism relates to a Swinburne of the past, rather considerably different from the Swinburne of the present, & various reasons might be suggested why reprinting wd.would be regarded as undesirable. I wd.would not myself take any steps in the matter, but leave it for any one else to deal with who thinks fit. Have not read the Criticism this longish while past, but dare say it is not worse than my other writings. Swinburne lives now a rather isolated life, away from my part of London. I very seldom see him (thothough our feelings of friendsship has suffered no abatement), & don't know what I cd.could well say to him about \"Under the Microscope.\" I am sure he is no longer enthusiastic about Whitman, & I doubt whether he even likes his writings at all. My own feelings on the subject remain unchanged, & I was much pleased at the reissue of my selection—a much handsomer volume than the original one. That Birth-song by Swinburne relates to my eldest daughter: I forget whether there is any allusion in it directly connecting it with my dedication to Blake; but at any rate the young lady came into the world in due course after the dedicatee of the B. & myself had become wife & husband. I am happy to say that both my wife & my daughter are alive. My wife however has for 1¾ year been an invalid from bronchial attacks, & it is only this very morning that I saw her, along with that daughter, & my son, off by train to the Riviera San Reno, or perhaps Mentone— where they will remain I dare say till at any rate the end of March.Believe meVery truly yours,W.M. Rossetti William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 16 November 1886"
