    "text": "Woodland VillasTotley nrnear Sheffield.1-July-1880Dear Walt,I had a call a week or two ago from a Cambridge fellow lecturer R. D. Roberts—a Welshman. He is starting for America the 20th of this month—going to Iowa to spend some time on a farm there, then returning to England. Wants very much to see you en route. He has asked me to write and find out where you will be the first week of August. I suppose you won't mind seeing him if anywhere within call. He seems a very genuine fellow (I never saw him before) but is rather diffident about bothering you. Says you mention Wales or the Welsh twice in your book! Could you send a postcard Robert D. Roberts Post Office, New York—saying where you will be early in August? Anyhow I will tell him to call at your address in Camden.I have received a letter from Dr. Bucke—which I shall answer presently. I like his address to the Teachers Association very much. Thanks for several papers you have sent lately. I do enjoy this outdoor life and digging potatoes—and never mean to abandon either again! I am living with a man—the best friend I ever had or could think to have—an iron worker, scythe riveter, and his little family. He often says 'I wish Walt Whitman would come over here'. Below my window here there is a wooded bank running down to some water, and beyond again about 2 miles off the hilly undulating line of the Derbyshire moors—from which there comes a broad fresh breeze—like being near the sea.Yours, dear friend,E Carpenter Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 1 July 1880"
