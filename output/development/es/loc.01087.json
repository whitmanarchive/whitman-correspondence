    "text": "Proposed Memorial to the late Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.The memorial is restricted to the letters and literary contributions of only a limited number of the most distinguished men and women of America and Europe, and will be published in noteworthy form for presentation to Mr. Beecher's family, and as a lasting record for his friends and the public.EDWARD W. BOK,Editor,320 State Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.A.March 16th '87Walt Whitman Esq.Dear Sir,It is the earnest desire of Mr. Beecher's friends that this memorial shall be in every respect of the most representative character, and that this may be the more certain of accomplishment, I beg to solicit your valuable cooperation. The memorial will take the form of estimates of Mr. Beecher's character and the great public services rendered by him, and it is hoped to make it of such a character that it may ever remain a notable record of his life to be referred to in future years by his family and his friends. From promises and contributions received, the high character of the Memorial is already assured, but we fully recognize the positive advantage it would receive by some tribute from your pen. We are therefore particularly hopeful of a favorable response at your hands, and this we most earnestly solicit. As it is desired that the memorial be issued at as early a date as possible, may I beg the further favor of as speedy a reply as may be practicable?Repeating our sincere hopes for your kind cooperation in this matter. I am, Sir, Very Respectfully Edward W. Bok. Edward W. Bok to Walt Whitman, March 16, 1887"
