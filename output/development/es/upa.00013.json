    "text": "February 8, 1872.Dear friend,I send by same mail with this, my latest piece, copied in a newspaper—& will write you just a line or two. I suppose you duly received my former letters (two)—I ought to have written something about your children (described to me in your letter of last summer, July 23d, which I have just been reading again)—Dear boys & girls—how my heart goes out to them—Did I tell you that I had received letters from Tennyson, & that he cordially invites me to visit him? Sometimes I dream of journeying to Old England, on such visit—& then of seeing you & your children—but it is a dream only.I am still living here in employment in a Government office—My health is good—Life is rather sluggish here—though not without the sunshine—(Your letters too were warm, bright rays of it)—I am going on to New York soon to remain there a few weeks—but my address will still be here—I wrote lately to Mr. Rossetti quite a long letter—My present address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D. C. U. S. America.Best love & remembrance to you, dear friend, & to the young folk—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 8 February 1872"
