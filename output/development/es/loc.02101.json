    "text": "46, Marlborough Hill,St John's Wood,N.W. London24 Sept. 1890Dear Walt Whitman,Accept my thanks for your \"rejoinder\" and the newspaper that reached me in the same wrapper bearing your handwriting strongly in evidence on the outside. These occasional packets with which you indulge me give me great pleasure. The hint that you are there, exercising the old vigorous unmistakable pen-craft, and throwing a thought across the sea to this little house, always sends me out of doors feeling better affected than usual towards the dingy humanity and depressing conditions associated with London Business life; and as I pass Gilchrist's \"good gray\" portrait of you sitting in the sun, where it hangs in the passage to be passed 20 times a day, you are vivified for the moment with an extra vitality. Is this nonsense? I think not.Yours everH. Buxton Forman Harry Buxton Forman to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1890"
