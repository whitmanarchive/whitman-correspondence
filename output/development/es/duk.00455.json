    "text": "3rd Dec. 1890 21 Pearl St. Studio Our kind friend and brother Your letter, with 2 dollars duly rec'd. Han regrets very much that she cannot write her thanks, even a postal. She sypathises, understanding Jessies great loss, and she too recall Jeff in Brooklyn—his guitar—his close bond of friendship with you—closer as it were than a brother. She is allmostalmost seriously ill,—jaundice, nervousness, debility, and yet striving to maintain her home / our house. Bingham re-iterates that she must be kept warmer. I have written to Lou—she needs a long, heavy, wollen stocking that will expand when drawn on. I have connected my stove with hers in bedroom, by adding more pipe and elbows, at a cost of 1 dollar, which I told the worker he could send for, to Mrs. Lou Whitman, Burlington New Jersey—as before—Weather has been severely cold, moderating to day, with snow. I have no money am out at 10 dollars, interest 1 year—at Bank—due 10th Nov. not quite out of coal yet. Your kindness we appreciate every hour in the day. \"O Walt\" is so good. Charlie Lou must be particular when directing a package, to write the no 21 Pearl Street, to ensure certain safe delivery. Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 3 December, 1890"
