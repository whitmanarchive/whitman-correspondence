    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario7 Oct. '90Yours of 3d and 4th just to hand—also letter from Horace to say that the I. address is fixed for 21st (two weeks today). I have written Horace to say definitely that I shall be there unless something turns up to make it impossible—in fact I wd not miss the occasion for any conceivable con-sideration. Mrs Bucke will come East with me—will no doubt be at Address and she will stay East (at Ingram's I guess) for a few weeks. I do not believe that Mrs O'C. is not satisfied with the \"Preface\"—I believe it is exactly what she wanted and I shall believe so untill[until] I hear from herself to the contrary—so far I have not heard from her and fear she may be sick. Thanks for your promise of the M.S. of the preface—I want it particularly. It is good news that you have been asked and will write for N.A. If you could only get strong and stay so for a few years (as you may yet—nothing is impossible to such a constitution as yours) you might yet see the dawn of the splendid fame which surely waits for you in the near future.It is smoldering (as I have said before) and may any day burst out into a flame which will light and warm the world. There is no nonsense or doubt about this—the only question is—how long?\"How long, O Lord, how long\"Your friend and loverRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 7 October 1890"
