Somewhat of a lull in O'C's sufferings—Y'r letter came at noon—(a beautiful bunch of flowers from Mrs. Spaulding, Boston, same time—they are scenting the room as I write.) Horace and Mr Blake, Unitarian minister f'm Chicago, here this mn'g—pleasant visit—a spell of my currying (massage) f'm Ed at noon to me—(generally have two spells in the twenty four hours, one at bed time)—am getting ready for the special L of G. ed'n I spoke of—Horace has just gone over to the printer's & paper supplier's—Dave McKay has been over to day—paid me the royalty $55.64 cts. for sales of L of G. and S D on the last six months—& $100 on acc't of big books he has had & sold—write out on a slip all the typo: errors in L of G.—Annex—& Backward Glance—you find—& send me at early convenience—I ask you to write a line to D McK. to let me have a few copies (whatever I require) of your book in sheets, you waiving the royalty—I of course paying him the cost price—W W Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 28 March 1889"
