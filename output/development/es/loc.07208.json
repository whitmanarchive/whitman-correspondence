Managers.DOGS NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOTELS.St. Augustine, Fla.,21 Feb 88I have yours of 16th, Had the \"Halcyon Days\" a little while ago—like it exceedingly. Am very glad to hear such good accounts of Rhys and hope he may continue to prosper. He is a real good boy and deserves to do well. All quiet here, Mr. Pardee continues to do well. I think I shall certainly leave here next Monday and see you Wednesday or Thursday—I shall stay at Dooner's as usual shall be there from the station so if you should want to send any word to me you will catch me there as soon as I reach the city. Very wet weather here the last few days, I am beginning to fear we shall have bad weather & bad roads for the Presidents visit—that would be a pity. I am having a first class time here quiet and pleasant. Have not had such a thorough good rest as I am getting now for years—we have a splendid bay here and every few days I set out for a good sail on it, they have capital sail boats.Remember me to Mrs. Davis—Yours as alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 21 February 1888"
