    "text": "Perryville—MdFeb. 12/90My dear Mr WhitmanYou will, no doubt be surprised, when you see the signature to this letter, but. I have often been tempted to write you—to thank you for your kindness in writing to my boy—far away in the Sierra Madre mountains—andalways gladly welcoming any letters from his old home—and, especially from you—who have so many correspondents—and have also suffered from extreme indisposition, he has appreciated particularly your thought of him—& been much pleased—& his mother also shares with him the same feeling—I have once or twice learned, thro' the papers, of your ill health—with much regret—and, we are always interested when we see yourname—in print—I received a letter from John today—in which he mentions having heard from you & that he had received a card also—he has had an attack of Pneumonia—his first sickness since he has been out there—and, is much weakened by it—and. I realise how very far away he is—and feel anxious about him—I will not trespass further on your time but hope you areregaining your strength and much improved—Alice unites with me in very kind remembrances—Yours very trulyCarrie E. Wroth Carrie E. Wroth to Walt Whitman, 12 February 1890"
