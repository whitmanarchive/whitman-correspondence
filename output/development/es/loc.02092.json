    "text": "Adel Grange —Leeds—England 13th June 1883Dear Mr. WhitmanI am writing to ask you to send me the two volumes of your writings which you sent my sister a few months ago. They are \"Specimen Days & Collect\" & \"Leaves of Grass\". I enclose a post office order, if it is not the right sum please tell me. I hope it is not troubling you to ask you to send them. Edward Carpenter told us it was the best way to get them.I have had the English Rossetti edition a long time, but this one I want is beautiful, & I feel as if I cannot do without it, for I can't say what your words have been to me nor how glad & thankful I am that I have known them. I hope you are better than you were. I am very sorry that you should suffer.Believe meYoursBessie FordThe P.O. order is payable from Bessie Ford, the above address. Elizabeth Ford to Walt Whitman, 13 June 1883"
