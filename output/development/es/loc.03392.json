    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamdenMay 16 '89Dear SirThis sample of your binding (old fashion'd pocket-book style with ordinary tongue or tuck-flap, all holding snug, but not too tight or stiff) is satisfactory & suits me best. The dark green morocco, if you have it already, will do—but if you have to get it get a lighter green. Bind the whole ed'n alike, no variety. Make a stout paper pocket—(see last page, as written on in sample)—In trimming the plates, &c. (if yet to be done) trim them, especially No: 1 and No: 4, leaving a little more white paper at bottom, & less at top, the trimming in this sample seems to me to be the very reverse—The plates are all put in right in this sample—the stamp on cover is right—& altogether the job looks satisfactory. I particularly want 50 copies (or 100) in a week.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Frederick Oldach, 16 May 1889"
