What you set out mainly to say & have to say, seems to me very well said indeed, & I like the article—What you have to offer as the Carlyle-foil, in defence of America, I dontdon't like so well—(besides it is unnecessary any how—Unless one has got something outsmashing C himself—a battery-ram that batters his ram to the dust)—Write when you can—Do you want me to send you papers or any thinganything?—always yoursW W Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 29 March [1883]"
