    "text": "WESLEY WATER CUREHighland Hygiean Home.Near the celebrated Delaware Water-GapRailways: Delaware, Lackawanna & Western. And N. Y., Susquehanna & Western.Stations: Water Gap. Telegraph and Express.P. O. ADDRESS: EXPERIMENT MILLS, MONROE CO., PA.April 9th 1886 My dear Walt Whitman I distributed the papers and magazines you sent me to every body around me and they are a source of pleasure to all. This is the Paradise and purgatory at once of idlers, and the doctor does all in his power to induce people to leave off every intellectual exercise:—to become stupid; as he says: \"be a cabbage head\". By doing so he says the health is restored more completely and quickly than it otherwise can be. We go to bed at 8.30 P.M. and rise at 6 a.m. Take a short walk: get breakfast at 7.30 a.m. Go to prayers at 8.30—take another walk or lounge about: get water treatment from 10.30 to 12 m. From 12 m. to 1 p.m. is \"rest hour\" every body is expected be as quiet as a mouse and hand over himself or herself to complete \"rest.\" Dinner at 1.30 P.M. Rest 40 minutes after dinner then take long walks, drives, reading or loafing until 6 o'clock when those who want take supper—Most people go without supper—but I am not one of these. After supper talk or play cards until bed time. The people who gather here are mostly people of small calibre and odd notions and possessing some little means of living in an independent way and to enable them to flit about from one Water Cure to another and enjoy the rather unusual sort of society which it seems to me is peculiar to Water Cures. Many of them are real sufferers from bodily afflictions of one kind or another and it is likely that their lives would become intolerable to them if the water cure did not offer them a means of enjoyment by creating a society—a cult of its kind—of kindred spirits under afflictions, each tottering under its little load of little things and small philosophy, but large in the measure of satisfaction it brings to its votaries. The Spirit of piety which one observes is a genuine source of comfort, and blesses the lives of many who but for this would be in sad distress. I think I shall be home early next week.Yours Very trulyMoses A. Walshfrom Moses Walsh at the Wesley Water Cure—Penn: Moses A. Walsh to Walt Whitman, 9 April 1886"
