    "text": "Belmont MassNov 10 '90.Dear W. W—You are always \"so confoundedly in the right\" that one's words—if any are spoken—must be monotonously words of praise. Your political note—printed today in \"jottings\" pleased me immensely. I voted for the Independent candidates here in Mass. + editor Clement, Aldrich + I held a glorification over the result throughout the country, I cheered aloud when I heard it. It shows how true a man you are that old age even can never catch yr nimble wits in a rut (chinese) but you adhere still to principle + the ideal right. We printed a selection fr yr N. Am. R. article ( Smith editorial dept writing a few words with it). Clement said to me after the election. \"Well the country is worth living for now.\" I think we did not realize what a weight of depression of spirits lay on our minds before. Thank ye for the \"Truth-Seeker.\" Bucke must be cranky for the N. A. Rev. art. is one of the best you ever penned—ripe in wisdom + sound as a shell bark hickory nut.—Till we selectW. S. K. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 10 November 1890"
