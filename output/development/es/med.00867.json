    "text": "Philadelphia,March 18, 1889.My dear Friend:Since our conversation this morning it seems to me that there is a desire to get the weight of your authority to back up certain late works of fiction, which are simply nasty, without being in any sense true.Inasmuch as your friends have all along been contending that the so-called \"nude\" passages in Leaves of Grass are simply expressions of eternal truth, and that their purpose is in the direction of a better comprehension of man and of the democratic idea, it would (I think) be a misfortune if you were drawn into a seeming endorsement of a sort of literature with which Leaves of Grass has nothing in common.I feel the matter so deeply that I have put my thoughts on paper, and now enclose them.I am sure you will not think me impertinent in so doing. If I did not so venerate the great truth of Leaves of Grass and so love the author, I should not have dared to write this.Yours always,F.H. Williams Frank H. Williams to Walt Whitman, 18 March 1889"
