    "text": "1874Camden, Friday afternoon.Aug. 29–1874Dear Pete,I still remain about the same, & with nothing to write about in the way of my improvement, or any thing else—but I thought you would want to have a word. Your letter of last Sunday came all right. The paper has also come. I am no worse—& continue to live on hope—fortunately I have been stocked with a good plentiful share of it. It is pleasant weather here, though hot—we have frequent rains—We have had one to-day, about an hour ago, but now it is very bright and pleasant—I am going to try to get out a little—So good bye for this time, dear son—I hope to write more of a letter next time. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, [1874?]"
