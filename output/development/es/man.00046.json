    "text": "CamdenJuly 4th 1880Friend Walt WhitmanThe above date is not much account to you Canadians, though a whole heap to us. I hope you and doctor Buck[Bucke] will not have another fight of coarsecourse you will want to celebrate the day we swore vengence[vengeance] against him and his ancesters[ancestors], though I guess he has forgot it all now, anyhow give him my kind regards—the weather has been long warm about two weeks. You know that we had commenced a new depot when you left, well now it is beginning to lume up one span of the 400 feet by 180—is about finished and looks huge, if you stay away all summer you wont[won't] know the place when you come back you will remember that we had a new Rail Road under way running to Atlantic City, it is finished and such crowds that went down yesterday you never saw before we never had such a rush on the Ferry before 4 men in the ticket office could not sell the tickets fast enough, it requires 3 collectors to take up the Ferry tickets with hard work that is PhilaPhiladelphia side you know. I saw old ColColonel Johnson and Doctor Ridge last night they were blowing for GenGeneral Hancock Doctor Ridge says he has been to New York and that New York city will give Hancock one hundred thousand majority people think that he will go in with a rushI guess that you know GenGeneral Hancock may be, though I suppose you don't vote for him I don't think (Garfield) is not strong. I hear them say that your friend J W Forney has come out for Hancock with the press I don't know—we have received several papers from you, one about yourarival[arrival] in London and a very good account of you us[US] fellows your friends were pleased with it and also your letter about your wanderings that you gave the paper. The paper in our opinion is a good one well Edited rather more spicy than our PhilPhiladelphia journalsThe boys read your little postal cards with much pleasure, all being delighted to hear from you Hiskey is all the same, and Charley Walton and Bill Clark would send their love if they new[knew] I was writing, we wish you may have a pleasant time all through and not get sick like you did before I expect that Ontario is a good place in summer I wonder if it is not cold next winter there however you will be home before the winter comes I am going up to ColColonel Johnsons[Johnson's] tonight, Maggie goes to Delaware this week to spend some timeRespRespectfully yoursE Lindellfrom Ed: Lindell July 4 '80 Respegius Edward Lindell to Walt Whitman, 4 July 1880"
