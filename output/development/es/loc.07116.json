    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario30 Sept. '90Your letter of 26 & 27 just to hand. A thousand thanks, dear Walt, for the first proof of the \"Preface\" and a thousand more for the promise of the \"Copy\"â€”I hope it is not destroyedð”ƒŠthe fact of it being in a muss does not matter at allâ€”the great thing is to get itâ€”no matter about the state it is in.The fall in temperature (as the season advances) is bad for you because it tends to check the action of the skindo not forget thisâ€”the moral isâ€”attend all the more assiduously to the functions of this organâ€”keep well clad, above all wear flannel next the skin all over (shirt and drawers) and change these frequently since the flannel absorbs the secretions all the better the cleaner it is.I wish you could have a regular Turkish Bath once a weekâ€”it would help you very much. Neither do I see why this should not be arrangedâ€”of course there is no T.B. in Camden but there must be several in Phila and I guess you could go there as well as not either in your chair or by cab.An occasional dose of Friedrichshall, first thing in the morning, to loosen the bowels moderately could do no horrible harm and would proabably add to your comfort.So it is to be Horticultural Hall? I hope that hall is a big one for as sure as a gun if the Phila friends take advantage of the situation as it stands at present therewill be a crowd! And don't you forget it! I wish Horace would write me what they propose to do.They should advertise the address in the American styleâ€”for all it is worth. Make the biggest and loudest kind of a Hurrah about itâ€”Chaff the Pharisees and tell them to \"come on!\" Lord how dear old O'C. would be tickled to be in the middle of this thing!Love to you dear Walt alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 30 September 1890"
