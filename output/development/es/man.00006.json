    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,March 23d1880My dear WaltThe two copies of \"Leaves of Grass\" came safely to hand: I have given them to Anderson (as in letter of 18th inst.) and he will begin advertizing[advertising] \"Leaves of Grass\" and also \"Two Rivulets\" tomorrow morning. I want you now to send me two copies of \"Two Rivulets\" at once so that he will have both volsvolumes —Do not mail the books to Anderson as I told you on 18th but mail them to me—Please answer my letter of 18th as soon as you can make it convenient to do so.Of course the Canadian purchaser ought to pay the duty but I am afraid it would never do to make the cost of the book more than $5.00—this price itself is enough to keep 9 out of every 10 who would like to have the book from buying it—I wish you could see your way to get the book into the hands of a good publisher and sell it at a moderate rate. I hope yet before I die to see the whole book published at about $1. and in the hands of the every where.Your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 March 1880"
