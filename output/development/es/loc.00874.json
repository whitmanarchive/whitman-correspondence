    "text": "Somerville MassJan 6th, 1865My Dear Friend,I have been thinking much of you lately & wondering where you were (for I heard some time since that you had left Washington), when the N.Y. Times came, with your long & interesting communication. I do not yet, from reading that, understand very well where you are, & I send this at a venture. If this reaches you, please let meknow your address, & I will try to send you something to help along your good work. I sent you, some time last summer, by private hands, a copy of \"Great Expectations\" & two dollars in money, but could never learn that they reached you: did they? How are you now?A great change has taken place in my life since I saw you. My dearest friend has left me, leaving in her place a little boy, noweleven months old.—A superb little fellow (although I say it); & in him I have great comfort.I went three times to find Dr. LeBarren[LeBaron] Russell, with your note in my hand, but failing each time, I gave him up.I am not trying to withdraw from the arena of popular literature; only the necessity of coining a livelihood has kept me in it so long. I feel that, if I live frugally ' sincerely, and do not use up mymental energies in rapid writing I may be able to do something excellent. I am about getting out a volume of poems,—or, as you would say, prettinesses.Sincerely your friendJ. T. TrowbridgeWalt Whitman John T. Trowbridge to Walt Whitman, 6 January 1865"
