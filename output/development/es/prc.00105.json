No such letter of 22d, nor P.O. order has reached me—& of course none has been paid by P.O. here. I see that Jan: 6 I sent you my circular in answer to previous letter from you—that is the only correspondence—I have sent nothing, heard nothing, rec'd nothing since. But as in all such cases, I consider it my obligation & loss. I send the Two Volumes, to you, same mail with this—The Two embody all my works—the little Vol's being only selections from them in duplicate. Walt WhitmanWalt Whitman | Feb. 2/81settled o.k. | F.H.R. Walt Whitman to Frank H. Ransom, 2 February 1881"
