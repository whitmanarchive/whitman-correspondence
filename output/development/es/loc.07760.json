Every thing is going on much the same—am sitting here as usual by the fire—weather mostly unpleasant and dark & stormy—I get out at intervals in wheel chair—appetite & sleep not even as well as before—but I hardly call them real bad yet—good bowel action day before yesterday—eye sight failing, bad sometimes—Suppose you rec'd 2d number of Stead's magazine I sent—Did I tell you the (London) Universal Review, Feb. 15, prints an article (mark'd \"in French\") ab't me—I don't know whether it is the old article we know or a new one—the May Century coming is to have a little poemet of mine—I will send you a couple of printed impressions on slips—Harry Stafford has given up his telegraphing & RR job and moved to a nice (hired) farm with his wife & two childer—he is poorly—the mind-clouding was temporary—(the worst of course is the eligibility of returning & worse)—¼ to 2—I have had my massage—y'rs of 30th comes & is welcome—the April Century comes—the pretty deep snow of yesterday eliminates—the spring shows itself apace—what a tough old rosy earth it is after all (& itself saying nothing ab't it—no bragging or whining or chinning)—God bless you all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 1 April 1890"
