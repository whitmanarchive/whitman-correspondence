(Let me have it at wholesale price, only paying yourself what you pay for it). I want it for a Christmas present for a young man—Can't you send it by express to-night or tomorrow morning early? Walt Whitman431 Stevens st cor WestCamden New JerseyI might as well leave you some margin. If you think of something a little more price or different any how, better, send it along, as it can be changed, paid for, or made right when I come on in January—I find I have no revenue stamp to put on check & cannot go out to get one— Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 20 December 1876"
