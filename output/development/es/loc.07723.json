Dear Mr. Whitman I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the \"impalpable nudge\" to write to me. Thy card has come to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits & discouraged. I have been quite ill all summer—\"over-work,\" \"nervous prostration,\" the rest—& in spite of many weeks of tedious \"absolute rest,\" I am worse & not better, & now I have to go off for I don't know how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband & the two little ones in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright spot is that mother is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me—it reminds me that absence is not the end of everything & it sings, without the definite words, the \"Song of the Open Road.\" My road has seemed so shut up—I am laid adside in the midst of all the work I care for—fit for nothing—and Oh! the horror of feeling one's mind, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read a study or write or do anything I cared to all summer long. But thy remembrance reminds me not to complain, & thy example encourages me to keep sound in spirits—\"which is the main thing.\" Thank thee for writing. I will write from the Pyrennees in a few days—& I hope I shall not be so egotistic & gloomy. I am sure thee will have seen Alys by this time &that she will have told thee all our news. Gratefully & lovingly, Mary Costelloe. Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 4 November 1889"
