    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Tuesday forenoon April 16, 1867.Dearest mother,I rec'd your letter last week a couple of hours after I sent mine. I have written to Hannah. Well, mother, we have had a spell of warm weather here—& last night & this morning we are having quite a rain—I can see the difference this morning already—the grass & trees are beginning to look green—they have made a large flower garden right in front of my window at the office.Wm O'Connor is coming on to New York to stop three days—he goes on to-night—he may call on Jeff at the City Hall—but may-be not—H. J. Raymond wants him to come to New York & write for the Times &c—but I don't know as he will go—I went to a concert last night—Brignoli & Parepa—nothing very great—There is nothing new at the office—I went up to the Supreme Court last Friday, & heard the Attorney General Mr. Stanbery make quite a great speech—he is a good speaker—you would have liked it.I was down at the hospital Sunday—there was one poor young man, a Maryland boy, very bad from delirium tremens—(such cases are getting quite common)—this young man saw such sights & terrible things, he took it into his head that the Almighty was in a rage, & punishing him—& he just got on his knees, & remained so for over 12 hours, praying away for mercy—so the wardmaster told me—I sat by him some time—he told me, \"they\" went away while I was with him—he said he could hear \"them,\" a good ways off—but they wouldn't come near him while I was there—he got into quite a little nap while I remained—you know if the delirium tremens patients can only get a few hours good sleep the worst is over—they are rational on most things—One of these men, in the hospital, had an idea there was a great cat gnawing at his arm, & eating it—he had this idea for days & days, & of course suffered awfully—One of the watchmen of the Treasury, (formerly a Captain in the army, in an Ohio reg't,) is there in the hospital, with delirium tremens—So you see what troubles there are in the world, of one kind & another—We are quite busy at the office—have a good many people coming—so it is quite lively—We had a clerk here, who was a great nuisance to every body, a young sprig of a Virginian—he has cleared out, forced to resign—we are all very glad—it makes a great relief—all the rest of us get along like brothers—I like them all, & they like me.WaltIf Mary & the girls come, you must give them my love, & tell Mary I shall send her a small package of books soon—I will send word before.Tell Hattie she must behave like a lady & try to learn—Uncle Walt is coming home soon, to see her— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 April 1867"
