    "text": "Pasadena, CaliforniaFebruary 11, 1887Dear Walt, William and I are here at Dr. Channing's home. I brought William out here from Washington in the hope that the climate might arrest the progress of his disease. It was a serious undertaking to bring so sick a man three thousand miles on a railroad train, and he was much exhausted when he arrived. He has hardly recovered from the effect of the journey as yet. In fact, he is worse that he has ever been. Can walk very little without the assistance of a friendly arm. If any improvement is to be achieved, it must come hereafter. This is a garden of fruit and flowers. . . .William and I received here (forwarded from Washington) letters from Mr. Lovering, M.C., relative to your hospital services. William was unable to answer, much to his regret, but I did the best I could on my own account. Hope for a favorable result. . . . He [O'Connor] has received an indefinite leave of absence from the Treasury Department with pay. He says he will write you as soon as he can. He sends much love, and so do I. Sorry to hear from the newspapers that your health is so feeble. Wish you could come out here and get strong. As ever, faithfully yoursCharles W. Eldridge Charles W. Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 11 February 1887"
