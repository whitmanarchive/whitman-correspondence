    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,4 Feb 1890A Mr Duffield, manager of City Gas Co. here, has been out all forenoon with us (Gurd & I) examining the meter (gas m.). He talks of putting in money and assisting us to get it started. His verdict on the gas m. boiled down amounted to this: \"Our m. is as good in all respects (better in some) as the m.s at present in use and can be made for about ¼ the cost\". If this verdict stands the m. is worth millions of dollars. The little \"Century\" piece strikes me deeper and deeper—all things considered it is one of the best—one of the most valuable things you ever penned—magnum in petto. If you think of it show this letter to Horace, want him to see the meter newsR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 February 1890"
