    "text": "BelmontAug 12 '90.Dear W. W.:—Normal—a bit blue. Am perennially happy + contented.The sad news of Boyle O'Reilly's death came just as we were blooming out for the G + R celebratn. It is a marked loss in the realm of camaraderie, of noble sympathy + ideal right-heartedness. He was a born fighter—O. R. pointed to his crossed swords once + said to me that that was the only medicine for Ireland's wrongs. The tall Irishman who escaped with him fr. Australia was with him in the room at the time. O R was once cornered into what fr. another wd have induced a confession that Ireland had been in the wrong. \"Well after all, said he, \"it is better to be Irish than right.\"It is a thrilling sight to witness this great G. A. R.Grand Army of the Republic reunion of the remnant of the war fellows. Wish you cd have seen 'em. They look stout & hale yet—most of 'em—strong as you describe 'em in the year '61, \"sad distracted year\" +c. But gray hairs plentiful. How hard to realize that 25 yrs have gone since the close of the strife!A noble-looking G. A. R.Grand Army of the Republic man fainted + perhaps eventually died just where I stood. I nearly ruined a pair of new trousers jumping over a barbed wire to help him.I walked among 20.000 soldiers on Boston Common—all cheery, strong-handed, tanned deeply—yellowish—by Western harvest suns. Gents, band music +c +c.'Twas a memorable night, too, to see the scores of trains from the great West sidetracked at the railway stations—great strip-labels on each train—\"Wisconsin\" \"Detroit,\" \"Post\" so + so. The trains came thro' unbroken western road cars—This reunion is to me next best to seeing the army as you saw it.So glad you're so cheerful. Mrs K says to me \"Always send my love when you write to Walt W.\" She was extremely pleased with the sweet simplicity of Mrs Costelloe's letter.I agree with you as to Symonds' books in general: they are unutterably dull + ,—. I shant see the \"Essays, Suggestive\" for a little while probably.W. S. Kennedy.The Transcript people did not asked[ask] for yr contributions. That was a device of mine to get things fr. you. Yet Clement the ed. is a Whitmanite + likes you much, as you may know.I'll get in to himYes—he wont be I'd like a cup of cold water get that brandy till tmrrw night oh! In meantime oh! cold? nice + cool——present with notesAug. 1890 at discovering O'R's death William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 12 August 1890"
