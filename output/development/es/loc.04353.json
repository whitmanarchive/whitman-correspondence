So I have taken the liberty to send it.Your kindness on the field of battle, and in the hospitals, is deserving of all praise—and is appreciated by all Britons.Being a stranger, not having read much of your poetry, I am very anxious, if possible, to procure, a copy of the first edition of one of your earliest poems—I am not particular which one—if you would kindly advise me where I could procure a copy—I am sure Sir, you have the best wishes of myself, and all—for your health and happiness + wishing you a joyful Xmas + a happy new year.I remain Dear SirYour faithful ServantThos. C. ValeIt must have been a great consolation to you, to think that you have helped so much to alleviate the sufferings of those on the field of battle, and in the hospitals.T. C. Vale— Thomas C.
