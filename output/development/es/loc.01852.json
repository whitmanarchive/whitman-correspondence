    "text": "Meltonsville, AlabamaJuly 5 1876Walt Whitman—Send only a Card to MeltonsvilleI feel a desire to write the things which follow—(somewhat discouraged tho'though by getting no answer or notice of what I wrote just about two months ago—it didn't need to be answered—perhaps it would answer it satisfactorily ly desired anything more get it. (An answer by P. Card want you to know I am not \"pouting\")In the fields most things prosper still. The same tenant, a father and grown up son who have made our corn and wheat for several years, are now \"laying by\" or giving their crop its final working—the wheat is waiting for the coming of the \"travelling\" thresher, and is much injured by rust. We are having all summer frequent but very light rains. Cotton is healthy but very small—I think because of so little hot sunshine. In the spring, when commencing to plow, I was feeling my 13 year old boy to g proved so as to be able to do could, and you \"better have been enjoying myself at the plowing and hoeing and always learning some good new \"trick\" about getting along well with the work.But I object to your plan of going out nimbly at the peep of day—no—sleep till near sun—rise, then build a fire for mother, bring water from the spring—milk the cow—eat slowly, long, and heartily, get out about an hour or hour and a half after sunrise—take a \"siesta\" of an hour and a half after dinner treating the tenant men Philosophy and Poetry Let the children sleep long in the summer mornings, for they wont[won't] sleep at noon. This is the way to conserve health, strength, long life, happiness, sanity of mind.Sleep, sleep, sleep, viva sleep. And now I must notice how little Walt is ing. We are alone. girls at school—two little boys in the woods—mother a mile from home to wash with \"soft\" water—Papa writing and Walt bellowing—a few minutes ago I put him up stairs to sleep free from flies, and tied his leg with a rope to keep him from tumbling down the stair way, but he got the rope off, and came to the top and stopped there. He has been \"cross\" for some days, but appears to be well always—curiously, thothough 19 1/2 months old and very \"smart\" he yet doesn'tdoesn't habitually speak a single word—I have told him Walt, you contain enough, why dontdon't you let it this is July 5— n in found by cr concessions to the thinking of suggesting to you. I think you may have omitted to \"celebrate\" one very important part of human nature.Haven't you dwelt too much on the longing for and hope of \"Immortality\" and the flattering conviction of all good deeds \"inuring\" to or \"coming back\" to the doers; and skipped the heroic principle (compound probably of love and courage) which says \"I will do good whether it inures or or not, I will be good and heroic my present or future interests is necessarily its own reward want any rewardA while back some debtors were good enough to pay me a little money!!! I dont[don't] doubt that.When I was a prisoner at Camp Douglas, I read a tale about a young negro man, who being for sale at an auction, a \"bidder\" said to him, \"if I buy you, will ?\" The negro gave him a very expressive look, and said \"I will be honest whether or not\" T occurred, and \"honesty\" differ, but such a good one. \"I will be good whether I am \"immortal\" or not\"—\" I will be heroic whether anything \"inures\" or not, even against unpopularity, misunderstanding, hatred, danger, God &c &c\". (I dont[don't] have known enemies.) Walt! I feel confidant you are heroic, and I want to hug your neck. (Have you lost money by your last Edition?) Have you sold well?
