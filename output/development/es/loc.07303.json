    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,18 May 1889Pretty warm here. Wonderful growing weather. Wish you could see the Asylum grounds and gardens, they look well. I got the papers about the dinner and about you calling in your chair at the \"Post\" office. I am real glad to think that you are out and getting a little fresh air and sunshine. All quiet here—no end of work and not much of any thing else. No word from Willy Gurd for about two weeks—don't know whether the meter has come to grief or what is wrong—probably he is busy & is simply putting off writing. I suppose the good Camden folk are fully committed to the dinner now. I hope they will make it a grand success. I wish I could be there but it will be impossible. We have an Annual Ball on 30th and if nothing else stood in the way the Ball would prevent me leaving. I am going to Delaware for a drive tomorrow—the country is as lovely as it can be I expect a good time—will tell you Monday how I got on.as always, your friendR M BuckeJohn CliffordRichard Watson GilderThomas B.
