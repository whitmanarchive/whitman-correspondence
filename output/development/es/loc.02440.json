    "text": "54 Manchester RoadBoltonLancs.. EnglandSept 13th 1890Dear Walt WhitmanJust a few lines to acknowledge the receipt of the \"Camden Daily Courier\" for June 2nd 1883[,] \"Unity\" Aug 28th 1890 & the accompanying slips \"of that blithe throat of thine\" \"Yonnondio\" \"Halcyon Days\" & \"the voice of the rain\".The Daily Courier is of especial interest as containing an admirable critique of Dr Bucke's book & I fear in sending it to me you have despoiled yourself of one of your treasures butthis will all the more enhance its value to me and I desire to thank you very cordially for it & for the other papers you so kindly sent.Mr Wallace has kindly shewn me the post card he received from you on Sept 12th from which I am extremely sorry to learn that you are suffering from an attack of the Grippe—though from the fact that you were not then confined to the house we are in hopes that it is not a very severe one & that it has by this time passed off & left no bad effects upon you. We hope to hear better news fromyou soon.We have seen the French article in the Universal Review—in fact I have the number containing it.Later 8pmWe have had a glorious day for our out-of-door meeting—an ideally perfect day. Nearly all \"the boys\" were present with two friends S the reading of my notes &c which took place in a green field beneath a tree occupied nearly two hours & was much enjoyed by every one & by none more than myself for I seemed to be living over again the happy time I spent with you[.] Much were they all interested in all I had to say & much do they appreciateall your kindness to me & thro me to them. They esteem it a high honour to have been medially brought into personal contact with you & Mr Wallace has been commissioned to express this to you by letter which he will do probably by next mailPardon my writing more at present as it is close on mail timeWith reverential love & gratitudeI remainYours affectionatelyJ. Johnston John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 13 September 1890"
