    "text": "Dear friend Hiram,Your letter of 27th May has come safe to hand, & I was truly glad to hear from you. Hiram, you must not think I have forgotten you, for I have thought of you too many times since the days we used to see each other there in the Hospital. Lewis Brown is well. I see him often. He has a place here as Clerk, at $1200 a year. He is in the 4th Auditor's Office, Treasury Department, & that is his address. Did you know Adrian Bartlett—in Ward K? He is also a clerk in 4th Auditor's. Thompson, the one so low with diarrhea, went home to New Jersey, & I have never heard from him since. Taber was killed in one of the Battles of the Wilderness. Shot in the head & fell instantly. Tom Sawyer, (Lewy Brown's friend), passed safe through the war—but we have not heard from him now for two years. Dr. Bliss is practising here in Washington. Dr Bowen also. Old Armory Square is now used as an Army Clothing depot. Of course all the big hospitals are long broken up—there now remain only the Post Hospital, U. S. A. on K st. & two or three small regimental hospitals in & around the city. As to me & my fortunes I am in pretty good health, thank God—& I am working in the Attorney General's office (as the heading of this letter.) It is an easy kind of place—the other clerks are all young men, friendly & jovial—So I have things pleasant enough. The pay is 1000 a year.Miss Lowell is still around—is interested in the African schools. Lewy Brown has just been in to see me—he says he wrote two letters & wrote to your mother—Joe Harris often asks for you & is doing well—is in the State Office—Mrs & Miss Martins are well. Curly, at last accounts, was home in Ohio. Cate is home in New Hampshire—he has been committing matrimony—& is now supposed to be suffering the consequences—poor reckless young man—Mrs. Wright is at Flushing, L. I., New York. She is in the Soldiers' orphan home. Hiram, you ought to have put in your letter how you got along with your leg since, & how you are now in health, & how you are situated. I want to hear all about you generally—all the particulars. Well I believe that is all this time. I send you my love, dear friend & soldier, & I hope this will find you well in health & in good spirits. So God bless you, boy, & for the present I must bid you Farewell— Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, [30 May 1867]"
