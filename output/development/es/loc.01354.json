    "text": "40 Grosvenor Road,Westminster Embankment,S.W.October 21st 1886.Dear Mr. Whitman— Thy card of the 4th greeted us on our return home from Wales last night. How I wish that it contained really good news, it is dreadful for thee to have to keep thy room so long! I am sending thee Mr. Summers' account of his delightful visit to thee. I am so grateful to thee for seeing him—I suppose it was my letter he presented? He is a curious man, with first rate political ability, but extraordinarily lazy. He has been a very intimate friend of my husband's since their College days, but I do not know him very well. I often see him hovering on the outskirts of a crowd at large parties, but he seems too lazy to talk to anybody. If he were more energetic he could rise to be one of the Liberal Leaders, but he has been cursed with a comfortable income, & has never been forced to work. The parable of the Camel & the Needle's Eye is not confined to the Kingdom of Heaven. We have returned to a sea of work. Frank & Sam both going as delegates to the great Liberal Convention at Birmingham—where we are to read modest papers on political subjects. The great event will be Mr. Gladstone's speech—wh.Which is to be phonographed!We have all had a delightful summer together in Wales. Father's health is quite restored, &, in spite of the loss of one eye, he is able to read & drive & follow his usual course of life. Little Ray gets more enchanting every day. She can say over 50 words by this time, & she is beginning to take an interest in dolls. She has a perfect temper & robust health.Please thank Mr. Gilchrist, if thee sees him soon, for the paper he sent me. I am glad he succeeded in getting the appointment, & I think the Phila.Philadelphia Academy is to be congratulated. I shall await with the greatest interest the copy of \"November Boughs.\" Will it be on sale at all in England? I have an accumulation of 20 letters to write today—so I must make my first one short. With love,thy friend,Mary Costelloe. P.S. Father & Alys & two of her friends start on a driving trip from Wales to London tomorrow. Logan is at Oxford. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe to Walt Whitman, 21 October 1886"
