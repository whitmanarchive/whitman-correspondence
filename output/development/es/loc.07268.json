With a few verbal changes, as \"poet\" for \"painter\" &c. large passages in it might be read for yourself—Especially the last ½ page. The parallelism in the lives of the two men (yourself & Millet) is wonderfull: for instance 1Both born and brought up near the sea wh exerts a profound influence on the mode of thought & feeling of each.2Ms books in youth Bible & Virgil Ws \" \" \" \" Homer & Shakespeare3Each born of country people & always stuck to these in preference to city & polished folk4Each strongly affected by a wreck at sea on coast near home in childhood5M. left country early went to Paris W. \" \" \" \" \" N.Y.6Sensier speaks of M's 12 years apprentiship in Paris—John Burroughs of W's 12 years preparation in N.Y.7\"The true M—Le Grande Rustique—revealed himself for the first \"time in 1850\" (36 years old—born in 1814)\" in Le Semeur—\"The Sower, which was hailed by at least one critic as a fine and original conception\" The true W. came out 1855 (36 years old) 1st Ed.
