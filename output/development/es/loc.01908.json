I would not write to you before I could give you sure information.It is a devilish hard thing to translate your prose, and our ordinary translators most surely would break the[their] neck in trying it.I shall send you the translation in loose sheets and give the bookseller order to send you one or two complete copies.When the book appears I will have left Copenhagen for one or two months; I am going to Germany a little tour.Your letters shall reach me surely, when sent to the old address: Clarebourne 16, 2.I should be glad to hear from you. An American gentleman told me, that you were going to England? Is it true?YoursRudolf SchmidtRud. SchmidtJan. 2, '74 Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 2 January 1874"
