    "text": "Department of Justice, Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury, Washington, D.C.,.............................., 187 .April 17, '73Dear Sir, Your letter of Feb. 8, '73, remitting my acc'taccount, and sales up to 1st of June, '72, (with check of $12:60) was duly acknowledged at time. If convenient, could you advise me, or get Messrs. Lee, Shephard, & Dillingham to advise me, of sales by them since that time, and to remit me the amount? Also how many books are now on hand. Also please return me, if convenient, the printed slip I forwarded you of my last acc't.account with you, marked in blue pencil \"return this.\" I would also like to inquire of Messrs. Lee, Shephard & Dillingham whether they would not take my books, (the new editions) & job them. Redfield sent me word that Mr. Dillingham declined, thinking there was no inducement, but I am in hopes he will still take them. I am in a bad way at present from paralysis—and am sick, & unable to get to New York, or any where—but expect soon to be better. There is beginning to be a steady, though moderate demand for my books, & if there were a good & permanent place of publication, I should advertise sufficiently. Walt Whitman to Francis B. Felt, 17 April 1873"
