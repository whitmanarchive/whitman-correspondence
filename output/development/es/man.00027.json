    "text": "17. Holland PlaceHighfieldsSheffield.Easter Sunday 1880Dear Walt,It is a long time since I wrote to you—but I have heard a good deal about you from the Gilchrists—about your journey West and back again. I am glad you have seen it all, and are satisfied—and the great mountains of Colorado—did they not make your soul shout? I would like to see you and be with you for a little time—it would seem so restful. I wonder now whether you have good friends about you at Camden, and feel at peace, spite of illness. Do you sometimes feel really satisfied, and as if you didn't care what happened, knowing it is done and can never be undone—dear Walt I wish you could live and renew your strength again in all those whom you have delivered. But perhaps you do so. I have long had it on my mind to write and ask you about the possibility of publishing a cheaper edition of yryour Leaves of Grass in England;—there are so many now who cannot afford the long price of present editions. I have thought that the sale might be so increased by a cheaper edition (say a 7/6 one) as even to pay you. But then there is the difficulty of publishers (Trübner wdwould I think do you justice); and of course you could not issue your present stereotyped ednedition in England at a lower price than in America. Still, what if a few friends in England combined to undertake the expense of a comparatively cheap edition, sell it through Trübner or some other publisher, and the profits to go to you. Would you approve? I have thought a good deal about it, and that is the only feasible plan whwhich occurs to me—that will make the book accessible to the people, and also pay you. But then again, would such a cheaper ednedition be pirated across the Atlantic & sold in the U.S.A in competition with yours? Of course you have thought all this over: but you may not realise, what I am only beginning to realise, the great demand whwhich is likely to arise here for your works, not among the literary world but among the ordinary working day world. I have often been asked lately about cheaper editions—A friend of mine, a carpenter, writes \"I need not tell you not to forget 'Leaves of Grass' whwhich I have no doubt will please me as much as did 'DemDemocratic Vistas'. If I had sent you the references I made (and I made them to send to you) you would have been amused for I had marked almost every page and almost every paragraph. I considered it would be better to praise the whole book, for it is all excellent. It is to be hoped Whitman will publish a cheaper edition of his splendid works. He is one of those whom mankind in the future will surely know better than now how to honourhonor.\" I believe I once mentioned to you a Mrs Hardy who is now out in PennaPennsylvania (Lawrence Co). If she ever comes to find you out—you will receive her. But I will not quote what she says of you—and yet I think I will—she says \"I have not felt it a 'new birth of the soul' merely, I felt that his poems were the food for which my poor weak soul was longing. Oh I do love him, the dear earnest old man, I want so much to see him to take him by the left hand and standing palm to palm look away up into his blue eyes and say 'Walt Whitman I love you'. There are only a very few men I know to whom I could say it, but he I know would be able to understand all I mean by it; and it wdwould do us both good—in no other way could I tell him how much I admire his poems\".About myself, I feel that I cannot go on with this lecturing—and in a month I hope to be at work out in the country near here—at first on some land of Ruskins—but perhaps not for very long so. When you see Harry Stafford give him my love and say I am going to send him a photo: and hope he will send me one.Goodbye, dear friend whom I do not ever forget. I wish I could be near you, in body, as I am in soulEdward Carpenter Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 28 March 1880"
