    "text": "33 Denmead St.Baltimore, Md.May 5 1878.My dear Sir:A short time ago while on a visit to New York I happened one evening to find your Leaves Of Grass in Mr. Bayard Taylor's library: and taking it with me to my room at the hotel I spent a night of glory and delight upon it How it happened that I had never read this book before . . is a story not worth the telling; but, in sending the enclosed bill to purchase a copy (which please mail to the above address) I cannot resist the temptation to render you also my grateful thanks for such large and substantial thoughts uttered in a time when there are, as you say in another connection, so many \"little plentiful mannikinsmanikins skipping about in collars and tailed coats.\" Although I entirely disagree with you in all points connected with artistic form, and in so much of the outcome of your doctrine as is involved in those poetic exposures of the person which your pages so unreservedly make, yet I feel sure that I understand you therein, and my dissent in these particulars becomes a very insignificant consideration in the presence of that unbounded delight which I take in the bigness and bravery of all your ways and thoughts. It is not known to me where I can find another modern song at once so large and so na√Øve: and the time needs to be told few things so much as the absolute personality of the person, the sufficiency of the man's manhood to the man, which you have propounded in such strong and beautiful rhythms. I beg you to count me among your most earnest lovers, and to believe that it would make me very happy to be of the least humble service to you at any timeSidney Lanier Sidney Lanier to Walt Whitman, 5 May 1878"
