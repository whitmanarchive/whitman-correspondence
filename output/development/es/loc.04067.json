I had almost come to the conclugen[conclusion] that you had given me up for the lost child many a time I have wondered what kind of a fellow you thought I was. I dont[don't] suppose there Has a day past over my Head without me thinking of you.I am also very glad to learn of Mrs. Siters. I suppose she Has a Hard time of it. I recived[received] one letter from her and Johnnys[Johnny's] Wife they wrote me rather a lamentable letter. Poor Jo Adams Im[I'm] sorry he is a fine fellow tell him I send him my pies[pious] regards and hope he will get well soon. Johnny Cahall I cant altogether place him did he visit to live in Camden I guss[guess] so.So they have got the dummies running on Market St. [(] I here[hear] they reduced the wages to two dollars) The perment[permanent] Exhibition I suppose will create almost as big a time this summer as last. Im[I'm] sorry times is so Hard in Philadelphia and so many famlys[families] are in distress. I am glad Mrs. Siter is going to Have a small famley[family] and perhaps John Pickens will assist her. I suppose Goorge[George] is pretty smart I cant help but think about poor old Granmother[Grandmother] Gouth.Well Walt my dear old friend you say you feel wicked enough at times wich[which] you consider a good sign [(]I hope it is) you say you have been traveling a good [de]al. I hope you will be home to get this any way I will direct to your old Headquarters.Well Walt I will endevor[endeavor] to give you a rugh[rough] scetch[sketch] of my wanderings since I seen you. You know I could not content my self in Phila.Philadelphia—I was in Hot water all the time to come and see you before I left I Had not the corage[courage] to do that so I drawed[drew] my money from the Centennial went down to my sister's she was not at home but Annie, Johnny's Wife was thir[there] I tould[told] her my intentions I was very sorry I did not see Mrs Siter Went direct from thir[there] to the Depo[Depot] and in less than half an Hour I was behind the iron Horse stearing[steering] twards[towards] Sunsit[Sunset] came strate[straight] through to St. Louis. Had a little row with some Pickpockets on the Road—staid[stayed] in St. Louis three Weeks then came out to Pleasant Rige[Ridge] whare[where] I wrote you a letter but got no answer staided[stayed] thir[there] about one month then moved East about seven miles to Grays and I think I wrote you a letter from thir[there] but never received an answer (began to think you had gone back on me) staid[stayed] thir[there] until the twentyfourth[twenty-fourth] March when I Emegrated[emigrated] here to Effingham Co. Ill. And am farming on my own Hack) Thir[There] is two Hundred and sixty acres in the farm and the way I spraind[sprained] my Rist[Wrist] was Plowing a stumppy[stumpy] pece[piece] of Ground [(]I Have got about ten acres of corn planted about thirty acres plowed) this is a very Backward Spring Hear[Here] as you say it is thir[there]. The times Here is pretty Hard asposuly[especially] with me as I Have got all my captal[capital] invested in starting Farming But if my crops prospers and the European War continues I will com[come] out all right and I guess make a big thing.Walt I have got a big lot of work to do about three mens[men's] work; But I think Compent[Competent] to the Emergence if I keep my Helth[health] You asked me about the women kinder a sticken[sticking] it at me oh well I can get all the woman I want out Hear[Here] But I havent[haven't] topt[topped] any of them yet. I got to be afraid of them they are treachers[treacherous] dont[don't] you think so right around within a gun shot thir[there] is a dozen Widows this is not a very healthy part of the world. Walt I still retain the ring you gave me and of course when I look at that I must think of you. You sent me a peaper[paper] which is very exceptable[acceptable] indeed as news Hear[Here] is very scarce I would like very much to have a Phila.[Philadelphia] peaper[paper].Walt I would like you to go up to nonumber 722 north 36 st. to see my sisters they are thir[there] keeping a Boarding House do go to see them and give them some advice thir[there] is so many dambd[damned] sharpers now a days im[I'm] a little fraid[afraid] to trust them all by them selvesthemselves Please go and see them tell them I sent you to see how they ware[were] gitting[getting] along I am alarmed about them some.Well Walt I have write[written] a good bit but havent[haven't] said much you know my capabilities is limiteddo write soon and tell me all the Public and Privit[private] news tell Mrs Siter to write to me And Emmie Pickens and Sallie Be carfull[careful] and dont let my adress[address] be known or less I will be trubled[troubled] to death.Walt I hope you will get well and be all right when I come home that wont be for some time if I prosper Here But not more than two or three years.you tould[told] me to write you a long and carful[careful] letter.
