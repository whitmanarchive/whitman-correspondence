    "text": "WashingtonAugust 23, 1867Messrs. Church.Gentlemen:The Weekly Tribune of 21st prints the Harvest Carol on its last page, but leaves out several connecting verses indispensable to the ensemble of the piece, & mangling it pretty badly in several ways. This is rather too much of a liberty. Would it be worth while to attempt a correction—asking the Tribune folk to insert in their columns an item like the enclosed slip—for instance?—As presented by them, the Carol is very much like one of those toy caoutchouc faces, with the mouth & nose utterly squeezed out—They ought by good rights to print it again in full, from the correct version in the Galaxy—but I suppose that could not be done.I only write suggestively, leaving it to you to decide whether it is necessary to take any action at all in the matter.This letter is not to be given, or alluded to, in publication should there be any.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William C. Church and Francis P. Church, 23 August 1867"
