    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. March 13, 1868.My dear Doctor,Your note has just come to hand, stating that you intend a visit to Washington, & desire a situation. My friend, if that is your sole object here, & you depend upon any thing of that kind, (unless you have some special friend who has great influence, or offices at his disposal,) I seriously advise you against any such enterprise. I myself have no influence at all, being a mere clerk, & of low grade—& our office is in confusion—the Attorney General having yesterday resigned his place—& it being very probable that the rest of the cabinet will follow before long. They are discharging many of the Department employesemployees, & appointing none. For some months to come, indeed for the ensuing year, every thing will be unsettled & in suspense here—There is nothing new with me—nor in our family.Yours, &c.Walt Whitmanwith friendliest regards. Walt Whitman to O. K. Sammis, 13 March 1868"
