    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. July 1, 1869Dear Alfred Pratt,I am still here in Washington, & work in the same office—My health is good, & there is nothing specially new or important with me since I wrote you last. I have received your letters. Dear boy, I would like to see you, that we might be together once more, even if but for a little while—I have thought I would try to journey out your way, for a few days—but it dont seem practicable just at present—I hope you are well—you must write me a good long letter all about your affairs & yourself—all will be interesting—I send you my love, & to your parents also—Tell them I hope yet to meet them—Good bye, dear young man—I too have not forgotten those times when you lay sick in the hospital—& our love for each other—such things are not easily forgotten—Some day I will try to come out there, & we will see each other again.Walt WhitmanI send you a newspaper with a piece in about me, that may interest you. I send it same mail with this. Good bye, my loving boy— Walt Whitman to Alfred Pratt, 1 July 1869"
