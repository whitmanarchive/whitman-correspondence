Sarrazin (his piece is a great steady trade-wind hurrying the ship into port) a copy of the big book. . . . Dr. Bucke makes a little fun of Howells's notice of Nov: Boughs in Feb. Harper's (the wonder is that it is so friendly and good). . . . I sit up all day and read and write (tho' both are getting almost loathsome), and keep fair spirits upon the whole. Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 28 January 1889"
