You are wise I know. I am otherwise. But it is Mrs JohnsonJohnston who seems most hurt—& she has been very kind to you—Now if I was Walt Whitman I wdwould write to her & say all the pleasant things I cdcould of the past—say I was sorry there was any misunderstanding—you know what to say—I think they are poor—& feel very very badly over it indeed—such a letter wdwould stop JohnsonJohnstons blathering—for it don't matter much what he saysAs ever yoursJ M ScovelPS We are all glad you are having so nice a time & send regards— James M. Scovel to Walt Whitman, 21 June 1880"
