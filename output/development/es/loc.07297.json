We have had a glorious day—bright and warm—There is nothing to tell you except that we are all well and the asylum and its affairs are quiet and prosperous. I trust you are something easier by this time. I had a long cheery letter from Mrs. Gosling (do you recollect her in '80 when you were at the asylum? She is a great friend of yours) from Birmingham, England where she is living now with her husband & little girl.In hasteLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 14 April 1889"
