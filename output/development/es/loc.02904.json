    "text": "BelmontJan'y. 10 '87 Dear Walt:— Rhys is here—now two days. We are having a capital time together. I am knocking off work to have a good visit with him. (Am so tired at night after all chores are done that I have not been able to do much more than crawl into bed. This will excuse my dilatoriness as a correspondent) Rhys & I go up to lunch with Sanborn Friday—Rhys to stay all night. Saturday he goes to the Saint Botolph Club, & to-day (snowy) we have been concocting a Boston Herald blast (varied by a forest walk after fresh eggs. I am much pleased with Rhys his bright optimistic nature. We are rubbing together as contentedly as two cats. Had a good letter from Sidney Morse, & was (as tickled as Rhys says you were) over his fine old mother. I suppose Rhys will write you further. I fear you are suffering from that old enemy lethargy & congested brain. Keep a good heart, dear friend, & believe me yours as ever WS KennedyP.S. Rhys is obeying yryour injunction to show me myself. Nothing delights me more & my limitations are so many. I see changes of improvement in many directions already— from his friendly suggestions. Rhys sends love. I may see you soon myself. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 10 January 1888"
