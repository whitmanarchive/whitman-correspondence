    "text": "Lake HuronJune 20Dear friends allI have come on some 200 miles further north & west (from Niagara) and am now very pleasantly quartered in Sarnia, Canada West, at the house of Mr and Mrs Pardee. (Mr P is one of the Queen's big officers here, & a tip-top fellow) I am writing this on Lake Huron. The weather is fine, & the country looks first rate. Susan I take every thing very easy, & so far I have felt unusually well & comfortable in health. George you would be interested in the way they farm here, it is a noble farming country but very different from Jersey new, plenty of good wood, hard soil, rather wet.—wheat, grass, barley &c mainly—not much corn & hardly any rye—good for potatoes—all later—I enclose you a letter I have written for the papers—George, Harry & Mont, it will give you some idea of my goings about here—Susan I know you will be interested in it—(I shall send it you in a paper here, in about five days, & then I want you to give it to Debby)—Harry, how are you getting along?—Edward Carpenter's address is 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton England—The waters here Lake Huron & St Clair river are as fine as I ever saw, & alive with steamers & sail craft—Every body is kind & hospitable wherever I go—to morrowtomorrow forenoon I am to visit a Chippewa Indian village out a ways—& in the evening a moonlight steamboat excursion up Lake Huron, they have prepared for us. I often think of you all. If any of you write, direct to me London, Ontario, Canada & I will get it. (3 cent stamp only required) Harry you write, dear boy—I go back to London Thursday—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to George and Susan Stafford, 20 June [1880]"
