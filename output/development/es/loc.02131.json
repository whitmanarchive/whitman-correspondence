    "text": "Jamaica Plain.Oct. 18/88.Dear Mr. Whitman:I began a course of twelve class lectures in Waltham yesterday in which I take up \"Walt Whitman's Message.\" I never have any difficulty in obtaining respectful lectures upon that theme. I hope to speak many times upon it.I had a very friendly letter from Mr. Burroughs—I am sorry I did not see him as I came through. I want to say also that I did not write that little notice of your book in Transcript. I am waiting till you send that autograph copy—then I will write a goodly review for Transcript or Elsewhere.— I have not seen Kennedy since returning—nor Baxter. Hope to do so soon.At earliest possible moment I intend to get that article into shape concerning your work as a landscapist.I do hope you'll keep gaining in strength—As Burroughs wrote me you were.With greatest esteem,Hamlin Garland Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 18 October 1888"
