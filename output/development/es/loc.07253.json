    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,5 Oct 1888This is the tenth day of dark, cloudy, rainy weather and no signs of let up yet, but as far as I am concerned I like it first rate have a good hard coal fire in the grate in my office—everthing snug about me and sit there and see people & write most of each day with considerable satisfaction. Wm Gurd has gone to Detroit to see a man re meter he will probably go to New York early next week and as soon as he gets things in shape there so that the patents are secure I shall go East and join him. We propose then to proceed to Philadelphia and show the m. to Harned and to capitalists (show this please to Horace). That is our scheme but it may be interfered with in many ways & I can say nothing absolutely for certain. My annual report is nearly all in rough draft and some of it copied out—it will be considerably longer than any previous one—I am pegging away & hope to get it completed and sent off before the end of next week.Hope to get a copy of \"N.B.\" in a very few days—expect \"C.W.\" will be something extra you are taking so much pains with it—it ought to be something a little out of the common by which to do justice to its contentsLove alwaysR M BuckeSee notes Oct 7, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 October 1888"
