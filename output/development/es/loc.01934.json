BUTTS & CO.,Publishers, Booksellers and Importers.139 Eighth STREETNew York,May 5, 1875Mr. Walt Whitman,Dear Sir:It is very mortifying to me not to be in a position to send you even a small portion of the balance your[you're] due. We are in a much better locality for retail trade, and we hope to stir up a better mail trade by a new list which we shall send out soon. But we cannot hope for anything very satisfactory, considering the unprecedented stagnation in all business circles, for several weeks. Assuming A.K.B. & Co.'s liabilities at such a time as this has made it very awkward for me. I never was in debt before. The business would be unmixed pleasure to me were my capital larger, as I think I can serve humanity better by distributing good books than in any other way. The first op- portunity[opportunity] that can be made, something will be sent you. I regret the inability to promptly settle more as I have understood you have never been paid by others who kept your books for sale. There seems no reason to doubt a good business being done here in a few weeksâ€”in the early fall. I hope your health is improving. Many persons ask us about you, and take a keen interest in your welfare. I regret that I am not so situated as to be able to extend you an invitation to visit New York, and offer you comfortable quarters here while you remain; but I do not \"keep house,\" have no family; and I vibrate between New York and Brooklyn as to sleeping quarters, not having any fixed habitation. Some one is compiling a book for the use of \"Liberals\" at funerals, etc. I have called his attention to your poem on Death (\"Dark mother,\" etc.), which I consider the finest ever written.Yours sincerelyChas.Charles P. Somerby Charles P. Somerby to Walt Whitman, 5 May 1875"
