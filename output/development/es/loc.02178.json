    "text": "12 Well RoadHampstead,London, England.25-1-86.My dear Walt You will be glad to hear that I am going to republish some of mothers essays; giving some account of her beautiful life. May I quote from some of your letters to mother? and will you help me to the extent of lending me, mother's letters to you? those that you have kept? I should be glad of them quite soon, as I have got to work already; at present thinking over her life is the only thing that I take pleasure in: indeed I am unable to get my thoughts away, and I don't want to. It will help the book if you can insert the following paragraph or something like it in the \"Phila:Philadelphia Press\" & \"Ledger\"â€” \"A Memoir of the the Late Mrs Anne Gilchrist is being prepared by her family & friends, we understand that the volume will contain a large amount of interesting correspondence exchanged with a varied circle of acquaintances and friends, including amongst others Mr and Mrs Carlyle, George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, William Michael Rossetti and Walt Whitman. Mr. T. Fisher Unwin will publish the work.\" I and Rossetti have inserted a final paragraph about \"free-will-offering\", giving the amount; as a final whip up to any laggard well wisher. I have just received 10/ from the HonbleHonorable: Roden Noel, who tells me that he is just republishing an article about you in volume form. I understand from Rossetti that since the last paragraph in Athenaeum; he has received several subscriptions. Giddy is fairly well and so is my brother Percy, his wife and chubby boy (Alexander G.) Rossetti is staying by the sea for his wife's sake, who continues steady; a little inclined to consumption I fear, is Mrs Rossetti, but not much. I am getting back to my painting again and feel a little bit more together, but not much: never did son have such a sweet companionable dear mother as mine. With best love to you dear old fellow.Herbert H. Gilchrist. P.S. You might as well send the copy of paragraph to J. Marvin for I have sent one to Burroughs.)
