Sun the other day the fact that you were in very needy circumstances, if that is so will you let me know, and myself and a few other of your old friends would be glad to aid you to the best of our ability. If it is not so, (which I sincerely wish may be the case) pardon the liberty I am taking and believe it is only done out of friendship and good will.In any case let me hear from you and believe me with best wishesYour FriendEdwin EinsteinAddressUnion league ClubN.Y.New YorkEinstein letter Edwin Einstein to Walt Whitman, 18 November 1875"
