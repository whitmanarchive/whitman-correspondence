    "text": "251 F 30thThursday Evening Jan 21 '69My dear Mr Whitman,I thank you for your thoughtfulness in rendering me the Atlantic with your glorious poem which has caught up the grandeur & harmony of the Cretian itself.I hope you will take the Crusades in hand in reference to Crete & the contest betwixt Christian & Mussalman .A grand subject worthy of true genius! A gathering of natures as shining & wild as that now tossing about in these States, all bent on driving the Turks & Saracens from Christian land. Popes, Kings, Emperors, he of France the sainte Louis IX & the English monarch Richard Coeur de Lion, Martinus Aussens & princesses, the flower of the nobility, all armed to the teeth, armor-clad with no thought but hatred to the Turk & love for Christ & for Womanhood, which the Turk defiles. Immense Caravanserais slacking from all lands, for several centuries, by rapt men—Peter the Hermit, Walter the Pennyless, all classes joining, all races, all ages; children's crusades; eighty thousand children En route for Holy Land; rabble; loafers; religious & otherwise join; thieves; prostitutes; all; high & low, virtuous & vicious, all humanity on horseback! But mark but then mere thousands of sailors; the ships of Venice, Genoa & Spain & behold the result! While their ships were crossexamining Mediterranean & Aegean sea to find the best harbour wherein to lay hand on Turk they became acquainted with navigation, with the art of navigatgnavigatingThe spirit of maritime discovery was thus initiated by these crusading fleets, & when this spirit had culminated in the discovery of America, then Crusading spirit dies out & trading spirit, venturesome, engendering negro-traffic, was ushered into existence.Hence the poet is right to conclude that the Enterprise which originated in Christian Enthusiasm, was killed by the spirit of maritime discovery to which it had given birthIf the Genoese & Spanish sailors had not been experimenting on the sea in the Crusading expeditions, the best of discovery would not have been developed; Columbus would not have been incited to his expedition & America would not have been discovered.And then the poetry that was born by the Crusades. Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, & Goethe's drama, Torquato Tasso with his poetic love of Princess Eleonora. And the chivalry, the heroic, martial spirit; the martyr; the Christ spirit the millions of Christians slain in the attempt to wrest the sepulchre from Turk.You see the connection. The discovery of America had the excellent result of the Crusading expeditions. But the spirit of Enterprise crushed that of religious entusiasm & thus it was that the Turk was allowed to remain to oppress Crete & Greece & now America repays the debt which it owes to the poor Christians of the East whose dream was sealed because America had to be discovered & a maelstrom of material Enterprise to be let looseHow grandly you might weave all this together in words & mankind-stirring stanzas! Ponder over it & if I can make further suggestions, let me knowFaithfully—Julius BingI enclose an outline of the main idea in a map.I further enclose a string of sentences, which express part of the ideas.Popes, Bishops; ChristPeter the HermitWalter the PennylessGodefroi De BouillonRichard Coeur de LionLouis IXperiod of enthusiasm & martyrdom& & &VenetianGenoeseScandanavianSpanishPortuguesesailors rise of art of navigation & cunfounder industry speculationdecline of religious enthusiasmfurther rise of navigation.

Down with the Turk!America accomplishes the mission of the , interrupted by the event consequent upon her discovery.Full two hundred years before Columbus cameThe way to his advent was clearly tracedBy the armadas thronged with CrusadersWho drove the MoslemMuslim from the land of Christ.While all Christian men & women too seized the pilgrim's staffTo wrest the hallowed East from Turkish grasp Thrilled only with the Sermon on the MountAnd caring not for tracing hidden empiresIt so happened that their wrestlings with the seas opened new vistas to ships & the art of navigation.Genoa, Venice & Spain were most buoy on that craftTheir swift sailors spread dismay in MoslimMuslim campsEven as in these days the SyranSyrian Candiot slavesBut mark! this sea alliance of Italy & SpainStretches far beyond the Saviour's tombColumbus was its immaculate conception and a new world thus linked with old PalistinePalestinePeter the Hermit & Walter the Penniless little dreamtThat their rhapsodies would give a lift to sailors and wings to the cross–colonies of the seaUntil the seamen struck upon these shoresTo communicate this mystic bond between East & West which the Voge's & Castilian fleets had initiated in olden timesAlas! greed soon followed in the train of enterpriseThe crusaders degenerated into tradersThe Turk descecrated the tomb of Christ and built his harem in the Holy Virgin's land.New centuries have since come & goneBut the old bond between East & West survivesWhen Arcade fell into thousand Christian martyrs & Men & women gave their mete to CreteThen the old bond revives with all its mystic charm.Pilgrim Rock & Calvary, Crusaders & Columbusand all the chivalric, holy trinity of them get revivedTo do in mere days & in our quiet wayWhich was done of yore in turmoil & confusionSo great is the result of the Genoen's adventureThat our influence transcend all the armies of all the CrusadersLet us pay the debt we owe to these great soulsWhere monarched Europe failed, let free Columbia win.Let our nation give the honour of fellowship to CreteTo Crete delivered from the Turkish yokeAnd by a divine law of grandationThey consummate the work in which Saint Louis was failed.The enterprise that killed medeival capture built up our ContinentOur bounties shall yet atone for a guilt that brought us into beingThe Turk need not complain for he had his spreeAnd more than this: when he is herded back to Asian wildsHe may then apply what he was by Greek & CretanCretianBut he shall no longer rule in Christian landsHis time is up; even Stanley sounds his death–knellLet him not stand upon the works of his giving, but go.—Crete redeemed shall lead the way to Holy SepulchreAnd upon the grave of Him of NazarethAmerica feels he stands becameAre Popes, Sultans, Kings the only annointed of the LordOr are we so given up to policy & selfAnd join the sceptic who decried the ageLet the People resolve to oust the Turk& we, too may have our age of Christian divinity> Julius Bing to Walt Whitman, 21 January 1869"
