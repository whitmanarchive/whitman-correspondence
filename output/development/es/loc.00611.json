    "text": "Syracuse New YorkNov 11th 1865.Mr. Whitman, Dear Friend,I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten by me.I have entirely recovered from my wounds long since and have been at work part of the time and attending commercial school. I have been at work about six weeks, consequently my hand is not in very good condition for writing.I have been promising myself to write to you ever since I returned home but have failed to keep my promise till now.I intend to go south in about two months and if I come that way I will stop and see you.I would like to know what chance I would have to go into business with a few hundred dollars capital. If I can not go into anything there, what do you think of my going further south, say to Savannah.I want you when you write to tell me just what you think about it.I do not know as you will be much interested by receiving this letter from me but I would like to hear from you very much. yours with respect.B.H. Wilson Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 11 November 1865"
