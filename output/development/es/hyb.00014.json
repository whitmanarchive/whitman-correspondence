    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden N JMay 10 '78Dear HerbertYour good letter reach'd me yesterday—& I dont wonder you like, & are exhilarated by, New York & Brooklyn—They are the places to live.—I was down at White Horse Monday & Tuesday last—expect to go down again Sunday—Just as I left your letter to Mrs S. arrived—All were about as usual—Nothing very new with me—I am only middling well, but go about—rheumatism not yet subdued—threatens to partially disable my right arm—(this writing probably shows it)—I am interested in what you say of Eaton and the sculptor O'Donavan (is it?)—should like to hear more about them—About the mulleins & bumble-bees I should like to have them as soon as convenient—Pleas'd to hear that you go around with the New York artists, designers, young fellows, & folk in the picture trade, publishing, &c—I think with the superb foundation you have it will be just the thing for you, fetch you up & make you aware what's going at latest advices, &c. which is very desirable—There is a book \"Stories from Homer,\" just published by Harpers—It is much praised in high quarters—I have wondered whether it doesn't contain the hint-suggestion of what your mother should do with the V Hugo translations—You might look at the book in the book stores—I have written a few lines to your mother to-daytoday—Write soon Herby & tell me all about your moves, & about the artists you meet &cW W Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, 10 May 1878"
