I am pleased well with what you write me in, & are doing by, your letter . . . Things go on with me much the same as usual of late . . . When you see any thing notable or pungent about me or my affairs, send it to me, as I neither see or hear much here.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Swinton, 12 April [1876]"
