    "text": "Cambridge—Feb. 20, 1885.Dear Mr Whitman— I want to thank you for the beautiful photograph of yourself sent me through Miss Smith. It is too true a likeness of you as you are now to represent the author of the Leaves of Grass. The picture which hung on yryour wall showed that person better—his paganism, his full senses, his readiness to identify himself with all things, his insubordination, & his recklessness of the fine relations which change a world of things into a world of persons. If I could prefer a poet to a man, I should like that picture better. But this will be the best reminder of the beautiful ripened spirit who met me in Camden & said, \"I did the work sincerely. So it is honorable. God shall use it to help men, or else let him throw it away.\" With warm regard, I amSincerely yours,G.H. Palmer George Herbert Palmer to Walt Whitman, 20 February 1885"
