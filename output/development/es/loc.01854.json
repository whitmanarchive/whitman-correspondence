    "text": "To Walt WhitmanThis is John Burroughs' Answer to a Card I sent him last of Nov—inquiring about the letter I sent him a year and a half ago—Please forward him the two pieces written for him after you read them.We are all about well.I enclose stamps to pay the letter to Burroughs—\"The soul is OF Touch\"—how much meaning in that o-f!!Write when it suits you and boast some on your future prospects.J. N.John Newton JohnsonEsopus, N.Y.Dec 1st 76My Dear Sir:Yes, I received the letter, with the picture & printed slips last year, & meant to have written in reply, but put it off too long, as I am so apt to do. Did you wish me to send the picture to Whitman? I saw \"great \" I have since, I think spared to us many years yet. He promised to come & see me in the spring.I have a 10 acre farm here on the banks of the Hudson near Po'keepsie[Poughkeepsie], I spend some of my time as National Bank Examiner, but most of here amid homely rural things which suits me best. I have one acre of strawberries, one of cherry currant, one of Red Raspberries & one of grapes. I also have a orchard. I like the fruits hay. I sometime take hold myself.Crops here of all kinds were much injured by the drought,—am sorry to hear of your bad luck & that with the rest death has taken one of your flock.I have no children & so am exempt from the pain of their loss.—Sorry you did not vote. I think Hayes is the man for all men of progress & ideas. Let me hear from you again. I will not be so dilatory in answering again. this morning.J.B.John Burroughs John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 20 December 1876"
