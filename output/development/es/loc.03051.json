    "text": "Belmont MassOct 15 '89Dear Walt Whitman:—Your beautiful gift rec'd the pocket book ed. L of G. I gloated and gloated over it. Such a precious memento! How we ought to love each other, & draw closer & closer in manly friendship—all of us who think & believe the same things of the universe & man. There is a mystery back of the visible, I am confident All matter seems to me instint w. latent consciousness. Those Platonic remembrances the dim pre-natal consciousness carried over thro' the seminal germ of foetus—very remarkable psychological fact—only showing the delicate character of matter.Thank you very much for the valuable & remarkably vigorous little Ilias-in-nuce sketch of Whittier. It is worth all of my book put together. You make me jealous—you man of great power—you write home with such resistless power, & graphic=picturesque words. I am going to quote what you say of Whittier. It's all right just what you wd say in print.I am having a grand visit from a cousin. A real Western woman.—A Woodruff (you may have known one kinsman (cousin) Judge Lewis B. Woodruff of New York Circuit-Court, highly revered man for his probity & his legal decisions). This HattieWoodruff McDowell, fr' the Western Reserve is one of those marvellous, energetic Western girls—wrapped in their purity as armor, who go out & locate land, farm their own living, & travel alone around the continent,—& lose no feminine charm. The world can't beat it!She brought in her trunk some calamus root which she boiled in maple sugar up in Vermont on a sugar ranche of her mother=in=law. I send you a little snip dear dad. Prost! I also send you per express paid a couple of jars of my nice currant jam put up by myself fr fruit raised by me here.Sorry indeed to hear of increase of that little deafness, & of yr eyes. Keep a grand heartHattie brings me a long letter of Jesse R. Grant, the General's father, addressed to my great uncle Granger, (Judge William G. of Ohio very wealthy now deceased). Jesse came very near marrying my uncle's sister he says. I may publish the letter. So keep mum. Curious to think what wd hv. been the fate of the U.S. if he had married Eliza G.!Wilhelm KennedyWm Sloane KennedyHattie brought me a great hunk of pure maple sugar too. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 15 October 1889"
