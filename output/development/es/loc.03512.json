    "text": "Christ ChurchOxford8.I.1889I am just writing this after reading your November Boughs. I want to tell you that I was glad of the Book. It comes to me in a time of trouble for me and it is a help—I think you will not be sorry to know this. If I were face to face with you there are many things in your last poems and writings I should like to talk over with you, but it is all too long for a letter and we cannot, save with difficulty, talk on paper. Your sketch of Elias Hicks is very pleasant to see, as like yourself I am proud of having Friends among my forebears, and their early history is a noble one, surely. You record some folks opinion that Elias was ambitious, but I don't see it in his face nor in the tone of the words you quote, nor in your impressions and I against it. You did a service before in showing people the truth about Old Tom Paine, Blake's friend, and I think many will be thankful for your work on Elias Hicks.I am going to send you a pamphlet which has in it a sketch of William Grimm by my best friend and fellow-worker Gudbrand Vigfusson. I hope and think you will like it. He that wrote it is I fear now seriously ill, but he is patient and cheery as your soldier-lads and he has waged a good fight too.You have many friends here and we do not doubt the success of your sortie you have told the truth and you know there are and must be a great-many people that don't like it and don't want to hear it, and feel it unpleasant, and hate the light because they and their ways are of darkness.I don't suppose Dante's Commedia was popular with those he judged, but the next generation did not sympathize much with them, and I am sure that the next generation in your new land (where the little silly imitators and make-believers are gonewith their lengthy foolish croaking and chattering that such folks go)—will be listening to your truths.If I could I would cross the water this summer for I should like to see you in the flesh, but that is in the hands of the powers, I do not know how my ways may lie these six months hence.But anyhow you will know that your last book has been a help for which I am grateful to you as I am for the former ones and their influence. I only feel that I do not do you justice as with the performance too often lags behind understanding and the spirit is weak too often also.But I have no right to trouble you with myself or my concerns and I will stop here wishing you the best you can wish for yourself for this year and those to followI am faithfully yoursFrederick York PowellIf you see Dr Bucke I should be glad to be remembered to him and his niece.There are a number of young men I know that read your books—not merely men of mid-age who follow Gilchrist and Rossetti. You will like to know this. Frederick York Powell to Walt Whitman, 8 January 1889"
