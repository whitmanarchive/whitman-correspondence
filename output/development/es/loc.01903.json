He is the American Consul for this place so you see there's no knowing how it may turn out, I am having quite a nice time among the Eliteelite of this place Ive[I've] just joined the Sons & Sisters of Temperance \"British Lodge\" & am making fine progress, Rode the cussed Goat last night & feel quite stiff over it, I wish you could have heard me speechifying for them you know Everyoneeveryone has to do that who joins. They wanted me to give them a recitation but twas no go unless they would take that familiar old piece of Peters[Peter's] (Something about the man who could not get his chimney up high Enoughenough to keep his neighbors Thomas cats from putting out his fire) Ha Ha, That would have been fine but the girls up this way are very modest so I got off quite an Elaborateelaborate address in which I expressed my Phellowfellow Phelinx to the best of my abilities & wished the cause of Temperance Everlasting progress & Said I supposed that in the course of a few more years I hoped there would be no such thing as Intemperance, (was interrupted with \"hear\" \"hear\" and any amount of cheering & in the midst of the cheering I brought my speech to a mighty sudden close & sat down the hero of the Eveningevening. Hows that for a Lager beer imbiber Eh, guess it makes you open your Eyeseyes somewhat. I am still improving in health getting more blooming Everyday Dayday people who saw me on my way here & who have been here within last month did not recognize the pale youth who passed them last summer.
