    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,5 Nov 1889It is 7.30 P.M. I have come over to the office to read and write for an hour or two. All well with us here. Yesterday afternoon I lectured to the students for two hours and a half (second lecture) finished \"Melancholia\" next lecture will be on \"Mania\" I am taking the \"Century\" dictionary—have the first six parts of it and have looked there over a good deal—it seems to me a really great work of its kind.No word yet from Willy Gurd—I had hoped to hear from him today but did not.—I had a little bundle of papers from you this forenoon—thanks.It is getting colder, begins to look and feel wintry, leaves all down, we have had no snow yet but we must have some soon—the children are all longing to see it—cannot say that I am, present weather good enough for meR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 November 1889"
