STEAD.TELEPHONE NO. 2867.TELEGRAMS, \"VATICAN, LONDON.\"Mowbray House,Norfolk St, Strand,London.December 10th., 1890.Walt Whitman, Esq.Connecticut, U. S. A.Dear Sir,I thank you very much for sending me a proof of your article on \"Poets.\" Had you not done so, I should have been compelled to have brought out the Christmas number of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS—a copy of which I send you herewith—without any extract from the \"North American Review.\" The parcel of \"North Americans\" which ought to have reached London, was lost between Liverpool and London, and I have not to this day seen a copy of the Review.Might I hope for the privilege of an autograph portrait of yourself, with a word of suggestion, criticism, or approval of the REVIEW OF REVIEWS? Next year I am going to acclimatize the REVIEW in the New World, and a word of welcome from you would be most useful.I am,Yours truly,W T Stead1890 W. T. Stead to Walt Whitman, 10 December 1890"
