    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. April 22, 1870. Dear Mr. Conway,I send (in the mail for printed matter,) same time as this, duplicate printed copies of a poem I have written, \"Passage to India,\" in which I endeavor to celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces, the Pacific Railroad & the Suez Canal—in fact the great modern material practical energy & works—& then make of them as heights & apices whereby to reach freest, widest, loftiest spiritual fields. But you will see what I have written. It will make from 12 to 14, 15, or 16 ordinary pages.Can I take the liberty of asking you to seek to dispose of the piece, if eligible, to some London magazine? It will not be printed here in any magazine—I reserve the right to print it in future book. The price, time, selection of magazine, and in fact all the points of that sort, I leave absolutely to you—My address remains as before at this office & city. Nothing new or very different with my affairs. I remain in good health & spirits.With love, as ever,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Moncure D. Conway, 22 April 1870"
