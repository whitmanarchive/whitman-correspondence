Y.TERMS OF THE PAPER,$5.00 PER YEAR10 CENTS PER COPY.NEW YORK,Nov 18 1867Walt Whitman.Dear Sir:Do you remember that I wrote to you, asking if you could not give us a poem, and if so, on what terms?May I call your attention once more to the matter. We should be very glad to have a poem from you, but I don't know how much the proprietors would authorize me to pay.When you are in town if you will call on me, I can show you two ladies—one of them my wife—who appreciate your poetry, as I do.It is only of late years that I have understood it; & I am now enthusiastic over it.Very Respectfully YoursW. L. Alden.(Associate Editor) William Livingston Alden to Walt Whitman, 18 November 1867"
