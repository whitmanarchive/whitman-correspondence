    "text": "CamdenMarch 20 '90Dear EdY'rs came this morning & welcome—Nothing very different here—much the same with me in health &c:—am feeling at the best I am capable of these times (& that is poor enough)—had a fresh egg & nice biscuit & coffee for my breakfast—sleep fairly yet—Warren is still with me & is very kind & good—gives me first rate massages, (twice a day)—Harry is quite unwell—the stomach seems to have given out, obstinately & badly, & there are other bad features—but H is young, good-spirited & the spring of year is at hand—all favorable points to threaten'd or incipient sickness—Mrs: D[avis] is well & smiling as usual—all send love & best remembrance to you—as I do too—I send the Camden \"Morning News\" of this mn'g wh' has a piece ab't me—the English register'd envelope, tho' common enough, will be one of the curios for y'r stamp collection—Ed, the little dinner b'k is a present to you, & is not to be paid for—Do you remember Harry Stafford—He is quite sick—has fits of being out of his mind—his wife has a new baby boy—Mrs: Somers's husband is dead & buried—a young RR friend Elwood Mills (consumption) was buried a few days ago, Warren's friend—you remember Florence over in Phila? She has a fine little red-headed baby boy—So the contrast—birth & life—just here I receive a beautiful bunch of great white lilies, sent me f'm Bermuda—Ed, when a fellow learns he knows little or nothing in reality, the old Socratic rule was, he was beginning to learn the very best—God bless you, boy—Always your friendWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Edward Wilkins, 20 March 1890"
