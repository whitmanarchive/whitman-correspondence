    "text": "London, Ont.,28 Aug 1890Your letter of 26th just to hand.Many thanks for the enclosures—Kennedy's letter and the slips from \"Times\" & \"Inquirer\".Scovel's long \"Talk with Whitman\" is about as little like W. as could well be—Guess we must stand it. There mis-representations will all be set right by and by. The real W.W. will undoubtedly emerge at last and be known of all men. Scovel's cussedness is damnable because he evidently means so well and does so badly. With (apparently) the best intention in the world, and thinking all the time that he is doing a big thing, he paints you as a 3d or 4th rate man all from pure inability to appreciate either W.W. or the quality of his (Scovel's) writing. But these little skits are nothing. The real Whitman will duly appear to the next and all following generations—do not be the least uneasyabout that. Sorry to hear of even partial return of grip—hope it will not stay long with you.All well and going well here. Gurd working away at meter, expects to have same on the market with a few weeks. We have had some aggravating delays. A machine of ours stuck fast somewhere down the Hudson—been stuck the last 3 weeks & still no word of it.—on account of strike I guess. So Johnston is back in England—I am real sorry he did not come along this wayLove to you now and alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1890"
