I will have to go over for a few hours any way for if I don't Mother will get on her ear she was very much put out because I did not go and see him the last time I was up in your house. I am feeling well, now but have not for some time untill today, sick about half of the time, but I guess I will be all right now. I have an invitation to a party to nighttonight but I think that I will have to stay home and tend store for Ed, he wishes to go over that will be an excuse for me H.G. tells me that you are well and doing fine sais[says] that you come over to see them every evening. You must enjoy it or you would not do it, I think it will be good for you to keep it up for going out will give you strength and exercise both, I would lik[like] to be down with you.
