    "text": "Washington, August 27, 1868. My dear Mr. Alden:Would the enclosed be considered opportune—& of use to you for The Citizen? As it has been printed before, it would not be proper to put \"For The Citizen\" over it—but just print it plainly. Of course it is gratuitous—& I accompany it with best respects to yourself. I have not forgotten your kind invitations to furnish an original piece for the paper—& hope one day to have something which will be suitable. I am writing very little lately. Should you print the piece, I wish you to do me the favor to send ten copies by mail to my address here. Walt WhitmanAttorney General's Office Walt Whitman to William Livingston Alden, 27 August 1868"
