    "text": "SyracuseJan 27th/1867Dear Friendyour letter of the 10th of January was received more than a week ago and should have been answered before this time but I have not been in the humor of writing and have kept putting it off till some more convenient season but I will try to be more punctual in the future.Father is staying with me again and he borrowed \"Leaves of Grass,\" for me of Dr. Hawley for a few days and was very much interested in it, but I will be candid with you. I think on the start I was more interested in it because it was your work than for the good sentiments it contained, but as I got more acquainted with it I liked it for its own value, although I can notcannot understand all of it I can notcannot find anything indecent about it. But my kind Old Friend you must not think that because I wrote to you and mentioned it, that I wish you to send me the Book for that is not what I intended for you to think.Drum Taps I have not seen yet nor is it to be found at any of the stores in Syracuse. Dr. Hawley has been trying to get a copy of it for about a month but all that was here were[was] taken as soon as they arrived.We have splended sleighing here now, and have had for about, two or three weeks or more.You say you wish me to write how I am situated what I am doing &c. I wrote to you a year and more ago that I was married but did not receive any reply so I did not know but you was[were] displeased with it.I was married to a New York Lady, Daughter of the late P.L. Gage of the firm of Gage, Sloans & Dater No 83 Chamber St and 65 Reed[Reade] St but like many others they went down in the crisis of 1857 I went into Business with a partner at manufacturing Parlor Brackets a little over a year ago and continued it about six or Seven months and lost about one thousand dollars and found myself in debt six hundred dollars and finally came to the conclusion that it was time I closed up my business, so I did so about the first of July last, and am now at work at my trade in a Piano Forte & Melodeon Manufactory and find that it pays me better than business on my own book. Now I think I have given you a good statement of my situation and hope it will be to your satisfactionIf you come to New York next summer on a visit I shall expect you to take a short trip up here to see me (if I am here) and I will pay your fare and take as good care of you as we possibly can. Now if you come to New York, you must not fail to let me know it.Hamilton has returned from the west. his Brother is gaining slowly, he sends his love to you and says he will write to you.Father is living with me now, he says he wrote to you a few days agoMy Wife wants me to send her love to you for she says she loves any bodyany body that I love I devote some of my leisure to reading and writing but I have not had any History except what we have got in the house because I have not had access to the Libraries, but if you will write what history I shall get, I will get a library ticket and try to get them. History is my favorite reading. I do not know as this letter will be very interesting to you so I will close for this time hoping to hear from you again soon.I remain as ever Your Boy Friend with LoveAtty GenlsB.H. Wilson, Jan 27,ans. Jan 31, '67 Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 27 January 1867"
