    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,22 Dec 1889Well the winter solstice has come but so far no winter. We had a thunder storm last night. Today there is a stiff breeze blowing out of the west. Not cold at all. No frost. Country all water and slush. \"A gray discouraged sky over head.\" Willy Gurd is not to be back to Christmas after all. He went to N.Y. last Thursday to submit the meter to some leading gas men. That is all I know about him. He may be home in a week or not for a month. Will all depend (I suppose) upon how he gets on. Should any flaw be demonstrated in the meter I have little doubt he will go back to Danbury and work there (be it weeks or months) untill the hitch is got over. Should no flaw appear he will likely soon be here. I am hearing almost nothing from the outside world these times, and am too much occupied to do anything outside my work. I wish you a good, pleasant Xmas, dear Walt, and am your friendR M BuckeBillstein's Bill $15.25. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 December 1889"
