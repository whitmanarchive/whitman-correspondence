There is not much talk of theVetterans getting out yet: if you have any thing in the way of advice to give concerning my imployment[employment] when I am Discharged talk plain to me Mr. Whitman. I have been about the world more perhaps than you would imagine there are a great many cruel turns and there a variety of ways of making a liveing[living]. Leaving hard work out of the Books, and I have thought that were bigger fools than me making a living very Easy although I admit my Education is Limited. Name any thing you Please and if I Do not Propose to accept: that is as far as it will Go I will blow on no one. What about Such houses as we were talking about and if it Should be made agreeable for me to take up Lodgeing[Lodging] in Close Proximity with yours. I Should be Pleased in the Superlative Degree. Please write amediately[immediately] after you receive this and Give me Some advice No matter what sort. I conclude.Hopeing to hear from you soon. Until then.I remain your Friend as EverNicholas D.
