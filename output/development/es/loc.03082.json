    "text": "Sund. '90Have just read the piece of our little spectacled brother Symond on W W. As before his plain utterance seemed to you, so now to me. This seems somehow comic—so inadequate is it + \"off.\" Yet there is some good weft in the shoddy—a little. S. lacks healthy contact with the live world. Did you ever hear that the Booths were of Dutch origin? Mrs K. is sure she read it. I have searched all the books in vain, tho' I find a little Welsh blood in their family. What curious blood—beating broad-vanned South windy! Have been dipping into Boccaccio. He is a healthy fellow, but his stories are too much for any flesh. My imagination is too vivid. I have to throw him aside.W. S. K. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 14 September 1890"
