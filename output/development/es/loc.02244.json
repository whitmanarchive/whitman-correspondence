    "text": "44 Court StBrooklynMarch 10 1885\"Walt\" Whitman EsqI have received through your consideration a copy of \"The Camden Post\" and read with a great amount of interest the leader about your noble self. The description makes me feel as if I had been in your room with its big trunk, and chair, and books and things scattered about.—Ye gods! You should see my room. It would bewilder the Devil and the Camden Post to boot to describe Its contents and wild disorder. It would remind you of the story told about the old woman who had let her Parrot and Monkey out of their cages in her absence, and on her return found things in a h—l of a condition.The next time I go to Philadelphia I will run over to Camden (without invitation) to see you, and once more, by looking you in the face, recover memories of the past that will refurnish the lost beats of my heart time has taken from me.—Yours with Love and respect,Gabriel Harrison.from Gabe Harrison March '85 Gabriel Harrison to Walt Whitman, 10 March 1885"
