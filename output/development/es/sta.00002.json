    "text": "Washington Friday, March 3, '65.My dear Trowbridge,Your letter has reached me—my best thanks for your contribution to the wounded & sick, & shall be applied in most needy cases. You speak of seeing Dr. Russell—has he not rec'd a N. Y. Times of two months since containing a sketch of my Visits to Hospitals—I thought one had been sent him. If he has not had one I should like to send one to him. The paragraph in the Gazette by Mr Shillaber is very kind. I do not wish you to send me any of the papers. Nothing new or special with me—I believe I told you I was working a few hours a day, a sufficiently remunerative desk in Indian office—I spend a couple of hours day or evening in the hospitals. Farewell.Walt Whitman Washington, D.C. Walt Whitman to John Townsend Trowbridge, 3 March 1865"
