    "text": "Brooklyn, June 18.John Burroughs,Dear friend,I rec'd your letter this forenoon, & went over to New York to see about the trunks—finally found the man in charge of expressage on board the Mary Powell, who said that he took them up to Rondout on the Powell yesterday, & landed them, to be forwarded to you—So I take it that they have all reached you safely before you get this.I am home here in Brooklyn, having the usual sort of a time—Mother is only middling this summer—My brother George & his wife, at Camden, N. J., are so strenuous for mother to break up housekeeping & go live with them, that I think she will go, next September—I expect to be on hand at Hanover on Wednesday afternoon 26th—it is middle or latter part of the afternoon I am to be on exhibition—shall hope to see you, dear friend, on the great occasion—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 18 June [1872]"
