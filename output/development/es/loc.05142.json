    "text": "Ferry—Delaware—noon June 29Your note rec'dreceived—I send you at a venture the earliest data & facts, so you can keep posted, & make whatever mention, if any, accurately—but would rather not myself only my name appear as furnishing anything, or giving authority for the statement—only whatever I send you I vouch forThere is a little nest of most malignant enemies to me personally & to L of G. in Boston (and in New York also) who are determined to press this matter to an extreme. The P M in Boston has lately been captured by them. I hear that a formal demand has been made on the P M General at Wash'nWashington to exclude L of G from the mails under the Comstock \"obscene\" law, & that it is now before that officer—perhaps has been already decided.In connection let me state that I am putting a new book in type, my Prose Works, called Specimen Days, & Collect, about 380 pages—gives a lot of random typical days, diary fashion, during my life—& then swoops pell mell my past literary papers, essays &c. in the Collect, (like fish in a net)—is to be a companion Vol to my Poems—Is to be pub.published by Rees Welsh & Co: 23 South 9th st.Street PhilaPhiladelphia, who are also to be the publishers henceforth of L of G, which they will put freely in the market in ten or twelve days—exactly as squelched in Boston,—(a $2 vol. same as the late Osgood ed'nedition.)—My friends in this conjuncture—(I consider you one of them, you blew the first blast, as clear & loud as ever trumpet pealed)—are, among others, Wm D O'Connor, Life-Saving Service Bureau, Washington Dr R M Bucke, London, Ontario, Canada, The Springfield Republican—Cambridge Chronicle—Sylvester Baxter on the Boston Herald—&c—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Talcott Williams, 29 June [1882]"
