    "text": "431 Stevens Street Camden N Jp m June 17 '82Dear SirsYours of 16th rec'dreceived—Although delayed from calling upon you by one or two little matters, I still entertain your proposals—I have had several—For one point I should like some publishing & radiating spot near my own locality—for another to retain control of my book & personally advise in selling & publishing it—Will call upon you Monday bet'nbetween 11 and 12—Walt WhitmanWhat would you say to entering decidedly into the publishing field? Haven't you thought of it? I want to publish my Prose writings in a companion volume to L of G—Then there is a Canada man who has a book—\"Walt Whitman—a Study\"—(Osgood & Co: had the MS. & would doubtless have issued it but for the flurry.)—Making three Volumes that ought to go out together, from the same house & hands—How would it suit you to get up this three-fold team & dash into the fall publishing trade? Walt Whitman to Rees Welsh & Company, 17 June 1882"
