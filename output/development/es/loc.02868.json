    "text": "50 Marquis RoadCamden Sqre.Novr. 12, 1872My dearest Friend,I must write not because I have anything to tell you—but because I want so, by help of a few loving words, to come into your presence as it were—into your remembrance Not more do the things that grow want the sun. I have received all the papers—& each has made a day very bright for me. I hope the trip to California has not again had to be postponed—I realize well the enjoyment of it, & what it would be to California & the fresh impulses of thought & emotion that would shape themselves, melodiously out of that for the new volume— My children are all well. Beatrice is working hard to get through the requisite amount of Latin &c. that is required in the preliminary examination—before entering on medical studies. Percy my eldest, whom I have not seen for a year is coming to spend Xmas with us. Good bye dearest Friend.Anne Gilchrist. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 12 November 1872"
