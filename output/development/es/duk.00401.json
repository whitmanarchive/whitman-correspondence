    "text": "Burlington Vermont.Feby 19, 1885.Bro Walt.It is night, clear and cold: Han has just left my room; gone to the east apartment: She prefers much to be alone. Cannot see visitors: does not talk much; wearies her; so does reading: must not read aloud to her; or narrate any thing from newspapers: occasionally breaks out into some small gossip, furtively: Is weak: too much so to dress up. Languishes on the sofa, or by the fire, seated on a pillow, in a tall rocking chair: sometimes with a blanket around her, in indian fashion: window partly raised, freshning[freshening] the room: has been about since 9 O'clock; attended some to dinner. prepared her own supper oysters stewed: baked apples: indian pudding, milk: prunes: takes no tea or coffee: She is come in again: sitting down by the stove: I am writing to Walt: says to give her love to him; wants to see him very much: had letter from Lou: yesterday; reporting you looking very well; which gave her great satisfaction. Lou sent her some time ago a box of underclothing, at my suggestion: She was badly off: I purchased a garment hose; could not wear it: could not endure a woman dress maker, to handle her; make such things for her was too nervous. She has now numerous blankets and bed comforters: and sleeps warm; bed warmed, between blankets. sleeps some; better: improves: does not feel her heartbeat in her brain so much; as she expresses it: does not use so much bromide: it is hurtfull to her: affects her seriously the next day: would craze her if she persisted: it is given to make her sleep; at too great a risk: Doctor was in last night: said she was not getting better very fast, but would acertaintly get well: She never can be as she was: look as well: be as strong. She has changed greatly: her neck and breast has shrunk: her face too: her eyes at times are sunken, glassy; her back is weak: her hair grows—so becomes thinner very grey. Yet her voice is natural: her step firmer. When this hard cold winter is past, she may recuperate. She tried to sew a little to day: I was away 3 hours this morning, to Winsor[Windsor] to get subscribers to my picture sale: cruel way to get a livinng[living]: 60 dollars in frames: months of work on pictures: shall distribute them next month: I meet with much sympathy among people but times are hard: The landscape is truly enshrouded a white country, snow enveloped, hill, valley, lake and river: Lou is to purchase two paintings: will help me much. Geo sent a check: he reserved for Han: It has cost me over 200 dollars, this winter new stove, extra fires: frames, groceries, etc—have not recieved a line from the girls.C. L. H. Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 19 February 1885"
