    "text": "Sunday afternoon ½ past 3Dearest mother,I am sitting up on the side of the bed writing this. Every thing is going on as well with me as I could expect. I rec'd your letter, dear mother—you may rest assured that I write the exact facts about my sickness—I am not gaining very fast, but it is sure—I am on the gain every day a little—I still have a good deal of distress in the head—the quieter I am left by general visitors the more comfortable I am—I slept fairly last night—& eat quite a nice breakfast this morning—(dinner I left mostly untasted)—I have all the attention I need, & food &c. I will write toward the middle of the week—Write whether this & the money come safe. Love to you, dear Mother & George & Lou—& don't be uneasy about me. I have been up by the window looking out on the river & scenery—it is beautiful weather now—they have sent over & paid me my January pay—all are very kind—Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [2 February 1873]"
