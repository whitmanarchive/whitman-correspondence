    "text": "Middletown N.Y.May 14, 1873Dear Walt.I received your letter, & the papers you so kindly sent me, both very welcome. The sight of the Washington papers forthwith induces a fit of homesickness in poor 'Suly' who seems to pine for the place and our old home there more than I do. I have got somewhat wonted here, & then I am busy & have many things to interest me, & she has little or nothing. Then the home in W.Washington was of course more to her than to me; her time was all passed there & only a part of mine. Still at times my thoughts will go back & hover & nestle about the little home & the many familiar places. I expect it will be a good while before either of us are weaned from W.Washington I am about to sell the place. The bargain can be closed whenever I come on which will be by Sunday I think. Then we will be quite homeless again & I expect the wife will be unhappy enough. I hope to be in W.Washington on Sunday evening, or Monday morning. I was grieved dear Walt that you was still confined to W.Washington & not able to go home; but your faith in your ultimate entire recovery is cheering. I hope it may be more speedy. I look forward to many delightful days with you yet, after I have built me another nest up here by the Hudson You will come and spend weeks & months with us & we will all be happy again. The spring is backward here; no lilacs yet & no signs of any. But the grass, the good green grass, is wonderful. It seems as if I never saw it so perfect before. This you know is a great grazing & butter country, & the fields & the spread of farms around are delightful to behold. They have something of the smooth, mellow, well kept look of the English fields, while their freshness & tenderness are marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes daily. Grass like this is never seen so far south on the Potomac. Yesterday I made a trip to Sugar Loaf Mountain 15 miles below here & could see over nearly the whole country from its summit, & could see the Catskills 50 miles to the North, & peaks that I recognized as visible from my parents[parents'] home in Delaware Co.County. But the rolling succession of green fields was the most wonderful.I have plenty of time on my hands now but do not seem able to turn it to any account in a literary way. I am like a cow that has lost her \"cud.\" I can't get back my ruminating habit. If I could only begin once more I think there are several pieces I could write. I have seen my father make an artificial cud for a cow, but I know of no receipt by which I can compound an intellectual one for myself. The first of my bird pieces with Scribner will not be out till July; when \"The Birds of the Poets\" will be out I have not heard.I take the \"Tribune\" so had seen the letter about Emerson. I am glad the old fellow is having a good time. Conway is no doubt happy.Wife sends much love. Hoping to see you in a few days I amEver your friendJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 14 May 1873"
