The Pond I have more joy & comfort from than ever—I shall not be up with you for a week, as I am to go down to the sea-shore Saturday with Mr Stafford—(not to stay however)—Hope to be with you next week—Will (probably) send you a postal card—This review of Hugo I cut from a late Weekly ed.edition London Times—You may have it already, but as also you may not, I send it—Seems to me good—Love to all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 10 April [1877]"
