come so the letters will be safely delivered i have been quite sick since george went away i dontdon't think i ever had such a bad coughfcough before i dontdon't know how i should have got the meals if he had been home my coughfcough is somewhat better to day i have had mustard plasters acrostacross my chest and i think it has done me good i feel the soreness of the mustard but the soreness and distress in my side is much better) last winter for all it was so very cold on the park i had to cover up my head to keep my ears from freezing i never had even a slight attack i had a letter from george) saying he arrived safe and was staying at present at the hotel but had been to phelidelphePhiladelphia and met one of his old army friends and went with him to try to get board at the same place with him but they were full of boarders so he hired a room in a private house for 3 dollardollars a week and has to get his meals as they didentdidn't furnish meals this is in phelidelpheePhiladelphia they charged him 12 dollars per week at the hotel in camdenCamden and not extra at that georgy says he says he thinks he shall like his position very well he went to see perbascoProbasco before he went away and he perbascoProbasco went home last fridayFriday and went out to see george and inform him i suppose in the ways you know perbascoProbasco is in mr Kingsly sKingsley's emploisemploy now at i beleivebelieve 10 dollsdollars a day i think mr Lane done it for his good will to george as there will be work there all winter and this where he was will stop and it was very bad cold ugly work purbascoProbasco says Jeff is having a great quantity of pipe made about 20 miles from camdenCamden and george could just as well inspect that and not neglect this in the least mr lane has wrote to Jeff and george wanted matt to write to him that george was there if he could put any thing in his way i told matt but whether she mentioned it to Jeff or not she said mr Lane had wrote to him but she would but walt if you write to Jeff you can speak about it) perbaskoProbasco used to make as much as his wages they say inspecting for other parties as they are not engaged but a few hours in the daywe have had anna VanwyckAnna Van Wycke to see us and staidstayed all night i have all the company now matt brings all her callers in here mrs Lane was here the other day last sundaySunday evening mr and mrs martenMartin spent the evening here came in their new buggy matty tells them all she only sleeps in next door i think sometimes it is pretty true i should think Jeff might tell by this time whether they will go or stay matt is well and real fat i tell her she lives so easy and sleeps so much) i dontdon't know what to say about moovingmoving i dontdon't feel much like it at present i get along quite well now the new family dontdon't make quite so much noise as they did i think they have got a carpet down and the old cradle dontdon't disturb me so much they are all american people i believe mr Hamblen is gone bought a house and moved all his manufactory which was immenceimmense and we have a butcher below now but i would rather have half a dozen buchersbutchers than the soap making they appear to be very quiet people and clean) well Walter this is quite a long letter for a sick woman to write) oh about the portlandPortland aveAvenue lot mr smith would rather keep it and is going to try to buy the 15 feet of french and put up 2 brick houses for sale) and the putmanPutman aveAvenue lot is improving i went round there a few weeks ago to

those houses that is building is very good the price of them is 6000 dollerdollars and he said Almond place wontwon't go thoroughthrough as he has tried to have it and wuldwould pay to get it through and that the title is good as he had a claimat one time on the property that george owns and he said the title was good enoughfenough he said the father of this young lawyer gave him this lot where the blacksmith is and he lettslets him have it as he dontdon't care for money he only gets 100 doledollars a year for it) he seemed very much like a gentleman he said there was no noise or any thing of the kind around his place) he owns 50 feet on Almond placeyour two shirts Walt is here all safe when you come home chrismasChristmasgood biei am sorry walter you have had trouble with your head i
