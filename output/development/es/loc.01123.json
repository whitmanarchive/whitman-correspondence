    "text": "CamdenSept. 9. Dear John Burroughs,Your letter of 6th came duly,—with the plans & photo., which I return herewith—John, the questions you ask cannot judiciously be answered, except as they involve the whole house, ground, purposes, materials, &c. &c. And in reference to & connection with, twenty different matters besides themselves. My brother & I are pleased with your plan, in general—my brother favors the ground story of stone—but the 1 ½ superstructure of wood, (says it is healthier & drier)—But I have no doubt at all that you will cipher out the sum yourself, & the result will be something cosy & natural.—I am not very well to-day—but am up & have been out—am generally about the same as noted in my last. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 9 September [1873]"
