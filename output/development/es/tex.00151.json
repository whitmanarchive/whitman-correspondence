I think it a very good piece. Every thing here in the office goes on as usual. I got your letter, mother. I wrote to Han last week. It is beautiful weather here to-day—I have got my new trowsers[trousers]—$20!!—only think of that!—it is lucky I wear my clothes a long while—Walt.Mother, I would rather you would use the money to get things for yourself—shoes, stockings, underclothes— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 27 November 1866"
