    "text": "Esopus NY.New YorkJanyJanuary 13. 79Dear Walt Whitman:We are back only a few days from Delaware C., where we had a good time, tho' the winter was very severe & I was storm bound in the house 4 days. I spent all the good days upon the hills & mountains hunting foxes or else upon the ice hooking up suckers; & now I am paying the penalty of the exposure to the severe cold in another attack of neuralgia in my arm & shoulder: it is very severe night & day. Wife & baby are pretty well; the baby is a great help, though he makes lots of work & trouble. Smith & family are well; he is working on the ice. He was pleased with his gloves.I have just sent off my MS. to Briton. At first the publisher liked the title \"Locusts & Wild Honey\" but now they write me they dontdon't like it—think it will mystify people &c.Tell me what you think. I send you a list of the subjects. They have nearly all been in print in the magazines, but I have been overhauling them very severely this fall. If I can devise a better title I shall do so, but I think my readers will understand this one; the great public does not care for my books anyhow.When are you coming to N.YNew York?With much loveJohn BurroughsLocusts & Wild HoneyContents Pages1 The pastoral Bees 22 ¼2 Strawberries 123 Sharp Eyes 304 Is it Going to Rain 305 Speckled Trout 306 Birds & Birds 167 A Bed of Boughs 308 Birds nesting 109 The Halcyon in Canada 4410 A White day & a Red Fox 12236¼Blank leaves 18254 ¼ John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 13 January 1879"
