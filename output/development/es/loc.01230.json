    "text": "45 Brunswick SqBrighton3 Jan 1876Dear Friend,A few weeks ago I sent you a book of mine—Moses: a drama. It is an effort to represent the character of one who being far beyond his time has conceived a new idea, a new development for mankind, and by the very force with which he has conceived it wills to shape out, and shapes out, the way of its realisation—standing himself all the while alone, solitary, upon earth.I hope it may be some pleasure to you to read it, if only that I may pay part of the debt I owe you for your writings.I write this, having just had put into my hands a letter from Moncure Conway written after a visit to you at Camden. Is it true that no American publisher will issue your works? While reading your writings I have thought the future for which you looked quite close, but then one goes out into the world and hears such things as this and sees the general drift of men's minds towards commonplaceness & conventional estimates of things, and then the future looks far—beyond all attainment as indeed I believe in some sense it is—and it seems only cruel that men (some) should be born to breathe their lives out after a mere visionary beauty. Will it ever be that human love—strong to meet with adventurous joy all chance & change—will cease to be a mere name? that men will 'understand',—eat of the tree of knowledge of good & evil, and so be immortal?.. How strange it is! I know that it must be, I see it everywhere—in face after face in the streets, in the sound of men's voices and in their silence—clear, unmistakeable, as if just about to be disclosed, the divine everywhere–equal life; and yet the children die, hardly knowing what they have sought yet knowing that they have not found it, and their dreams fade away, and to long suffering succeeds rest, and still the distance remains immeasurable.All is resumed. As soon as I remember what the end is—however great the distance—I do not doubt. It is quite sure—even as it is truly present with us now underlying all thought, & these words. Dear friend, you have so infused yourself that it is daily more & more possible for men to walk hand in hand over the whole earth. As you have given your life, so others will after you—freely, with amplest reward transcending all suffering—for the end that you have dreamed. In the midst of the ferment of this age of material & mechanical intercommunion you have planted the seed of a spiritual union & identity above all space & time, wh.which yet shall use the spaces & times of this earth (while it endures) for its manifestation and expression.What have we dreamed? a union which even now binds us closer than all thought—high up above all individual gain & loss,—an individual self which stands out firm & distinct, most solid of all facts, commensurate with all existence,— love disclosing each ever more & more.See, you have made the earth sacred for me.Meanwhile they say that your writings are 'immoral' : and you have to defend yourself against people who will misunderstand your defence as they misunderstood your original words. Need I say that I do not agree with them in the least?. I believe on the contrary that you have been the first to enunciate the law of purity & health which sooner or later must assert itself. After ages perhaps man will return consciously to the innocent joyous delight in his own natural powers & instincts which characterised the early civilizations. I do not understand what it is to be 'shocked' by these things : it seems to me childish. But in the meantime it is certain that people do not understand. In some way or other our modern civncivilization has become narrowed & onesided. People's minds are dwarfed : one portion of their nature grows up in the dark (& ceases to be healthy). Men have lost the freedom (free masonry) of Nature, and are plagued with insane doubts of their duty. For a time I suppose men must grow up in swaddling bands of morality, and a certain instinct makes them cling to them till they have grown to be greater than, & masters of, morality. But I think indeed the time has come for people to learn to unwrap these bands, and that from this time there will be a world–wide growth in the direction you have pointed out.So while I regret sometimes that there are things in your writings which make it difficult, sometimes impossible, to commend them to some who might otherwise profit by them, yet I feel it is best that they shdshould be there. Their presence delays the understanding & acceptation of your message, but your message would not be complete without it, and slowly, gradually, increasingly without end, its grandeur will dawn upon men.You are saying something on this subject in your Two Rivulets which I look forward to seeing. Can I obtain a copy through you, or have you an agent in London?I feel that my work is to carry on what you have begun. You have opened the way : my only desire is to go onward in it. If it is out of all question to suppose that one generation or ten generations will make much difference in men's minds in the direction of the ideal state, still to contemplate that ideal & to live slowly translating it into real life & action is quite certainly the only good—and is sufficient. I do not think of anything that I have done except as preparation ; on all hands the words seem to me to be flowing in but exactly in what shape they will issue forth again I am not quite clear, and I think it is my business to wait yet.Meanwhile there is a wonderful new life springing up here in England. I have been this & last winter at Leeds doing something in the way of lecturing & teaching, and have seen a certain amount of the working &c. There is undoubtedly an entirely new (social) state of affairs coming about through their rise, and I hail it with delight, for the wealthier classes though they struggle for light are hopelessly bound in conventionality, and the rough experience of their contact with the rude unaccomodating[unaccommodating] life below them (during the next few years) will be salvation to them. I am very anxious to see America, partly for my own sake—to breathe a less conventional atmosphere ; partly for the sake of seeing the people & appreciating the life that is growing up in them, for I find that no general account, or seeing this other man's eyes, helps me towards that, and I have no friend whose opinion I am willing to be guided by in the matter.I should go probably this next April, if it were not for the Philadelphia Exhibition—which makes me hesitate. Partly because it will increase the expense considerably, and partly because on account of the turmoil one will perhaps not see so much either of people in general & their ways or of individuals as at another time.If I thought that one occasion would give me a better chance of seeing you than another I should be guided by that, but on the other hand I fear to plague you—and I daresay you are tormented enough by people already ; so I will not as I have in of a d the end of for you to —and tI think or fancy that you are happy in your surroundings and am glad to think so. Will you tell me—you see I am not satisfied yet—where a photograph of yourself is obtainable? I am very anxious to have one. And will you forgive me for wearying you—if I have done so—with perhaps needless talk about myself, & believe meYours with continual remembrances Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 3 January 1876"
