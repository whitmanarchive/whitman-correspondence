    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,4 Nov 1888I have your letter of 31st and card of 1st gave the first lecture of the course yesterday morning—a demonstration of the brain—cerebral stabis—the next will deal with cerebral dynamics (what grand names we give to our various ignorances!). Ed. Wilkins is to leave London 11.30 this a.m. ought to reach you tomorrow forenoon—let me know if he has got to Camden and how you like the looks of him? Not a word yet from Wm Gurd—it is too bad—I do not know what to expect, may get a letter tomorrow wanting me to go East at once or may not be wanted for weeks yet—only thing is to exercise what philosophy one has—and wait. No doubt he is more or less in the dark himself. I wish you would find out the name of that Paris review which had a paper on L. of G. if I had name and date or even name could soon get it.Weather here very pleasant now though still showery—We are all well.Your big book seems to rather drag. No doubt it will be ready by the time I get East and you must give me a copy then.I shall write again in a day or two & hope I shall be able to be more definite in the re Eastern trip for I must hear from Wm Gurd soon surelyAlways affectionately yoursR M BuckeSee notes Nov. 6, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 November 1888"
