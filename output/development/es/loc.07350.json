    "text": "London, Ont.,5 June 1890Thanks for the \"Post\" and \"Inquirer\" just to hand. The \"Post\" article is exceedingly fine, did Horace get it up? The warm weather has stuck up here and yesterday and today we don't need a turkish bath to make us sweat. This is election day in Ontario. I have just voted. All is quiet here. My folks at the house are all well. I shall be pretty busy now for a while after my absence gathering up the ends of the strings and getting them in order in my hands againâ€”fortunately for me I have good, honest, faithful, capable assistants. I trust you are rested after the dinner. You looked tired on Sunday morning or was it that you caught a little cold over night?RM BuckeWe all send love to youRMB Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 June 1890"
