    "text": "Feb 18—1868Dear Sir:In response to your letter of the 5th instant, which has just reached me, I have to say that I accept the proposal made in it respecting your English publication of my poems—& hereby agree that you have the privilege of selling that publication in the United States, on payment to me, or my agent, of a royalty of one shilling, (or 25 cents gold,) upon every copy sold in the U. S. Of course it is distinctly understood that this grant from me does not affect my copyright here, but that said copyright, in each of its particulars & in the whole, is absolutely fully & exclusively retained by me.It is not improbable that a very handsome & steady sale of the English volume may be effected here, by the right business manipulation, a moderate, judicious advertising &c. My book has never been really published here at all & the market is in a sort vacant of supplies. I will probably suggest to you something more on these points, in a future letter.I received yesterday a letter from Mr. Conway, conveying your proposition, to which I mailed an immediate answer, to the same effect as herewith. Accept my thanks for the William Blake. It has not yet come from the post office, but I know it will prove to me a profoundly interesting study, and a handsome gift. It is, in fact, a book I was wanting.After the reception of the copy you speak of—my own volume—(now probably on its way)—I shall doubtless have occasion to express genuine pleasure—with gratitude both to its editor & publisher.And now, my dear sir, please accept with my trust in the success of the enterprise my kindest respects to yourself personally. Walt Whitman to John Camden Hotten, 18 February 1868"
