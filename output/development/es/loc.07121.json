    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,29 Oct. 1890Horace has gone and I shall (do) miss him much—he is a thoroughly good fellow. We took him in to the 11.30 train this A.M. and he ought to reach Phila at 7 A.M. tomorrow. His visit was far too short but we had a good time while it lasted—make him tell you about our drive to Delaware yesterday—Horace, Dr. Sippi, P.E. Bucke and Self—we had a grand time. On our way to the station this morning I got from you a card (27th I guess)—tell Horace I have not seen the Whitman piece mentoned in it and ask him to send it me—unless you send it yourself. Horace will tell you how we all are and what we are doing here. I have your card of 26th and Phila Press of same date (thanks for it) the little piece in it—\"Whitman—Ingersoll—Death\" might have been worse—but it also might have been a good deal better without being anything wonderful. Send and get \"Brief for Plaintiff\" Bacon vs. Shakespeare. 25e Rand & McNally Chicago.Love to you alwaysRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 29 October 1890"
