    "text": "To Walt WhitmanSuperintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,25 April 1888To Walt WhitmanI have had the two enclosed letters and your note to Kennedy and myself of 18th inst somedays, been too busy to write even a line, have never been so crowded with work of all kinds as I am at present. I do wish you were well enough to accept Mr. Fords proposition to go to England & Scotland. I am dead sure you would have the biggest kind of a time and lots of money (if wanted) might be made out of it. But I suppose it is no use thinking of such a thing. O'Connor's letter is not cheerful but for all that middling for him poor fellow, his writing is I think better than it has been, firm & clearâ€”if he could only get better! But we must not wait for it.All well here, lovely weather, spring coming on as fast as the North West wind off the neat ice fields of Lake Huron will let it.RM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 April 1888"
