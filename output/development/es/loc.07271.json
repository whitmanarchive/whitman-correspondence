    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,22 Nov 1888If I had Hamlin Garland's address I think I would write him a few lines to say how much I admire his calm and pleasant sentences in the \"Transcript\". I do not know when I have read anything that pleased me more—not I think since I read O'Connor's letter in the N.Y. Tribune on the Osgood-Stevens affair. We are coming to the front at last—and shall come—I have no fear, no doubt. It is only a question of waiting a few years untill men have time to take it in. Another quarter or half century will see L. of G. acknowledged to be what it really is—The bible of America.My visit East is likely to be delayed some weeks. We have abt. decided that we will not show the meter untill it is protected (by patent) in other countries as well as in the States. Wm Gurd will return here from N.Y. almost at once and proceed to Ottawa—arrange there for the Canadian and other patents—as soon as these are secured we shall go East. I, of course, cannot say how soon this will be but I am in hopes we shall get to Phila immediately after Xmas.Saw Pardee on Monday he is bad—very sick indeed—mind very feeble. Do not hear from O'Connor, do you?I am thinking over something to say about you and L. of G. if I have the chance when I am in Phila; impossible to say yet what it will come to, if anything.—must only wait and see. It seems to me a long time since I wrote you last—I have been in a kind of a whirl, better luck in future!Love to youR M BuckeSee notes Nov 24, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 November 1888"
