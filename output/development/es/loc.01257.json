    "text": "Providence R. I.Sept 24– 1868.–Walt Whitman Esq.Dear Sir,Mrs. O'Connor writes Mrs. Channing that you are in New York—I write you, on a forlorn hope, to offer you our best welcome if any thing should induce you to turn Eastward. We have to offer entertainment, not brillieant[brilliant], but quiet & unconstrained. You would find some few persons here whom I think you would like to meet. To balance this on the other side is all New York! All for which I can really answer is the sincere desire to see you here in a home-like way– I think we have a home that is worth something, & that we gladly open to you.Will you not visit us? Yrs trulyWm. F. Channing William F. Channing to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1868"
