    "text": "Meltonsville, AlabamaApril 26 1875Walt WhitmanIt is sometimes very hard to determine who ought or ought not to do or say or I feel it rather proper or necessary for me to write you a letter now and do the best I can. Along with the parcel of papers which you sent me after getting my baby's letter I got the picture and the double column bill previously sent me in the New Republic's regular issue (that is the matter of it) about Foreign lectures on an American Poet. The last paragraph speaks of \"indigence\" and I now write because of that. Let me guess why you gave authority to that statement—I think it rather probable that you did so as a sort of explanation of the reason or a hint of the fact that not able to offer the bill. Walt present or keepsake as would be suited dignity or exalted world the past that light I could be of your wish you were too poor to raise pay postage even on your If you know me well, one of the for the past, a rude but strong expression your work that you heard me!! I think myself best would be a remarkable , or of riches, show, dress, described absolutely by good sense Leaving off that supposition, , it taken you wanted me to post the bill as a sort of advertisement of your books. (When I was at \"town\" () two weeks ago, I sent money to Butts & Co. for a copy of Leaves of Grass to pass around among the folks there as a specimen—hoping, yet scarcely expecting to do much in behalf of increased sales of the same—The third supposition must naturally be that my real good-will is now tested. I send a bill of money which is yours and you shall have a good deal more if you positively need it. I have yet on hand two big bales of my cotton crop intended for spending money for the —sold the other of my crop (three more big one to get interest.

I hope to of more land and \"make things happen\"—Now, I can see clearly (as I think) that friendship with or assistance to Walt Whitman, if he needs, is about the best bid that any common man can make for immortality for himself and pleasure to his posterity—if intellectual retrogression of mankind is ahead of us it will not be.If the first supposition is correct, or the bill was only accidentally put in the package of papers & do this way—clearlyyou are not rich and I am not poor to hurt—you have sending me papers &c requesting an —if you have reason enough or through kindness of immensely or relatives) to live as will do you if you are content to desire to say \"bully boy\" Book always away from by a continuance of past would to have you use the money books, magazines or papers such as you like to read most and afterwards send to . I don't care for scientific works (except new works about mental or moral Philosophy)—I don't want political works, nor books of Poetry—I have not been such an enthusiast about Poetry as you might think, except that I have been almost insane about yours because you have so well expressed \"my sentiments exactly\" (However, you don't convert me to \"immortality\"—I have been through everything except revival religion or positive \"knowledge of God\") Walt! I think Native minds are for a \"Philosopher\" and (therefore skeptics\", but circumstances have made me and long time a believer in of one sort or other.
