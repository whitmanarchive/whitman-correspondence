WicklowMy dear WaltI have to tell you that towards the end of December I sent back to the German publisher the last proofs of the German Leaves of Grass. so we may soon expect its appearance now. I have ordered 100 copies & shall direct him to send you 30 of these—you can have more if you send me a line to say so. The contents are as follows:— To Foreign Lands —Excelsior (Transl. by K. K.)Oneself I sing—Starting from PaumanokSong of Myself—For Thee O DemocracyTo a Boy of the WestDoubt of AppearancesGive me the SunTo one about to die (KK)That Shadow My Likeness.Brooklyn Ferry.I Sing the Body Electric.City dead House.—Open Road.Salut au MondeSavantism.Who Learns my Lesson completeWhat am I—Square Deific.O Poverty, wincings—.—(KK)Faces (KK)The Letter (K.

K.)I got the Camden Post from you today, with enclosure \"Impromptu Criticism.\" I want to get the new 900 p. volume but don't know its publisher or its price. If you'll tell the publisher to send me a copy with account, including postage I'll remit money-order at once. Or if you are bringing the book out yourself I'll do so to you.Dowden gave me your kind message—I am very glad to hear of your even partial recovery from your late severe illness. Not over well myself, & very busy—life of Lessing for Scott & W on hand now which will be a troublesome business. but worth the trouble.GoodbyeTW Rolleston. Thomas W.H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 7 January 1889"
