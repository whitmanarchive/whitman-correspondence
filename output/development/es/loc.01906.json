    "text": "Kjǿbenhavn, d.Denmark 25 April 1872.Dear Walt Whitman.?){see index June 7 1888Just now received the New York Commercial Advertiser, which was for some days ago preceded by your kind letter. When returned to Washington, Clausen, who has taken a strong and sincere attachment to you, most certainly will be willing to translate the whole article verbally to you. I should be glad if after a thorough knowledge you still would be pleased with it. I have had very great pleasure in introducing you to the Scandinavian public, and most probably in no European country you would find the questions of the mind so favourable for the understanding of your poetry. Your books and portraits have in the last month circulated amongst the ladies of my acquaintance, for especially it is the women that are your friends. Bjornson writes of your article: \"Walt Whitman makes me a joy as no new man in many years and in one respect the greatest I have ever had. Never had I thought in my days (during my life-time) to get a spirit (or ghost, none of the expressions signify exactly our stand) ([]for my help—from America. But such and in no other shape of course it must come. I thank him and thee from my full heart. I went amazed during some days and still the great impressions are haunting me, as were I on the ocean looking on the driving ice-bergs, that are inaugurating the spring.\"I am very curious to know how you did like Clemens Petersen. Of course you did not like him. But if you have not found him broken by sickness and bad humors you must have felt, that here is a mind with perhaps the finest nerves for beauty, you ever met.Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on \"American fancy\" comparating[comparing] the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension in your newspapers with the humor of Luther and Shakespeare. Our own papers are some times bringing such specimens of wit and humour extracted from the American papers. Could you not find for me about a dozen jokes of this sort. That is all I want. For instance: I saw in \"Harpers Weekly\" one of your leading political men (whom?) as Cincinnatus by the plough bringing himself an address, the same person making (in two figures) compliments to himself. Another instance: A teacher explains to his children pupils the meaning of a phenomenon. An apple tree is no phenomenon; a cow is none. But if you were seeing a cow in an apple tree plucking apples with his tail: that would be a phenomenon!At present you will understand my meaning! Good bye.YoursRudolf Schmidt Rudolf Schmidt to Walt Whitman, 25 April 1872"
