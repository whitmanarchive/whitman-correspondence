I dontdon't think it would affect the new edition the slightest unfavorably—probably indeed do more good than harm to it—but is not of much importance any how—only (to me) as putting a few dollars in my pocket now & then—which I need—Shall not sell them if you object—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to James R.
