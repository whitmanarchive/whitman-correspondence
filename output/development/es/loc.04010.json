    "text": "CamdenWednesday Evn'gEvening Dec:December 1—1880Dear HankNothing very new with me the last two weeks—how has it been with you?—Are you on the C & A again—& how about that Medford Station?—Write soon—(it will do you good to write & fully & carefully—I wish you would oftener)—I have had something of a set-back—A rascally publisher in New York named Worthington has been printing and selling a cheaper edition of my book for his own profit, no benefit to me at all—& it has been going on privately for a year—I only found it out for certain about ten days ago—of course it is quite a hurt to me—will lead to a law suit, as I shall have to sue him, & I hate getting into law—it is almost as bad to me to sue, as to be sued—then it cost money——I am jogging along here about the same—keep pretty well, & eat my allowance every time—went over to 41st st: Phila:Philadelphia to eat my Thanksgiving dinner, with an old friend of mine, (his wife & two young ones)—had a good time—Came back home in a rousing snow storm, but got along all right—Sunday morning went to breakfast at Mr and Mrs Scovel's——I am sitting up here 3d story—warm & nice, every thing as still as can be—it has struck 8, and the wind outside moans & whistles by starts—have been reading the evening paper, & to-day's N YNew York Tribune—& I thought I would write to you, but I am afraid I havn't[haven't] made out a very interesting letter—It was well I was down there the good weather middle of November—it has been bad enough since, some bitter cold—I have got my new overcoat, it is thick & warm & I like it—have you got the new cider?—Love to your father & mother, not forgetting your share dear son—Walt Walt Whitman to Harry Stafford, 1 December [1880]"
