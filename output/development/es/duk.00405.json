    "text": "Burlington VermontJuly 30, 1885Bro WaltHan recd your card; was much concerned to learn that you had a fall: Weather is very warm here, but fine cool nights: mornings allmost frosty. The grandest genuine summer I ever knew. Mountains allways visible, asserting their supremacy. Vivid lightnings and startling thunder, with heavy showers. A big tornado passed, or crashed over the city, tearing a large luxuriant tree that grew by the gate, by the roots, as if it had been a bramble, and twisting a large to pieces, that grew at the corner of the house, dividing the branches literaly[literally], without knocking down the chimney nor even splintering a picket. How it razed and thrashed the slate roof; several houses were unroofed: the worst gale I ever saw: Han was much frightendfrightened: she is improving steadily, though weak: allright. She thinks if she could see you: talks of you great deal. I've not heard of the picture yet sent to Georgeâ€”Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 30 July 1885"
