The old is so sweet in the spring, especially when moistens it a little with his sweat, oh, if you could be here + see all this beginning of life again! I trust you do get out in your chair occasionally. It is a great comfort to know you was able to read your Lincoln lecture in Phila Julian is well + is helping me hoe in the vineyards. Ursula is well + terribly busy getting settled. Drop me a card. I return dear Williams Donnelly pamphlet.With much loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman 4 May 1890"
