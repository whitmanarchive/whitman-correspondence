We therefore send you over a few copies at once, with the request that you will immediately have the book entered for copyright & secured in my name—(immediately after which the work will be published here.)I am under many obligations in the past to my friend your Josiah Child, & should like to have this matter put in his hands—should like to have him write to me about it, direct as of old, to Camden New JerseyWW Walt Whitman to Trübner & Company, 5 October 1881"
