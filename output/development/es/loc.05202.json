PUBLISHERSDecr. 10. 1881.Dear Mr Whitman:We have your favor of the 8th: we had already heard of Messrs Tr√ºbner's change of base and Bogue's acceptance of the books, but we are inclined to think it has been for good, rather than otherwise, as we received yesterday from Bogue a cable order for 250 copies more.I think we on this side can stand that, if Trubner can.Very Truly Yours.B.H. TicknorI was in hopes you might have found something for the soldiers. You will see by the first numbers (there will be ) that it will have a very high literary list Benjamin Ticknor to Walt Whitman, 10 December 1881"
