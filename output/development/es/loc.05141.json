    "text": "Sept. 2429 Lange Str.Dresden.'82Your two postcards just recd. Nothing further as yet, but packages sometimes take a day or two longer to get to me. Sorry you didn't receive the piece of translationâ€”sent it with a letter a good time ago & was rather wondering I hadn't heard from you about it. Am working away at it with full steam up & feel that it looks promising. Will defer lecture till it is nearer completion. Rees Welsh & Co all hail! May your shadows never grow less! Will get prose book as soon as it appears. Will write soon as pictures arrive. Many thanks.TWR. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1882"
