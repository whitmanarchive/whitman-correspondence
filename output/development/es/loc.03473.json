Please read and return it, keeping copy of it if you so desire.We are not at present informed what portions of the book are objected to. We are however naturally reluctant to be identified with any legal proceedings in a matter of this nature. We are given to understand that if certain parts of the book should be withdrawn its further circulation would not be objected to. Will you advise us whether you would consent to the withdrawal of the present edition and the substitution of an edition lacking the obnoxious features?Yours truly,James R. Osgood & Co.B./Commonwealth of MassachusettsDistrict Attorney's OfficeBoston24 Court House—MchMarch 1st/82Messrs JasJames R. Osgood and Company,Gentlemen;Our attention has been officially directed to a certain book entitled \"Leaves of Grass,\" Walt Whitman,\" published by you.We are of the opinion that this book is such a book as brings it within the provisions of the Public Statutes respecting obscene literature and suggest the propriety of withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions thereof.Otherwise the complaints which are proposed to be made will have to be entertained—I am, yours trulyOliver StevensM.O.H.Dist. Atty.District Attorney Handwritten copy of letter from James R. Osgood to Walt Whitman, 4 March 1882"
