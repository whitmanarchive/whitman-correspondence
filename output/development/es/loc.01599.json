    "text": "BrooklynJune 30.Dear boy,I rec'd your letter of Tuesday last, & was glad to hear every thing was going on all right. I am well, & still enjoying myself in a quiet way—I have been home every evening since I come—but out quite a good deal in the day—the weather is splendid here—plenty cool enough. This has got to be a great place for boating—All the rich men have their yachts, and most every young man belongs to a boat or yacht club—sometimes of a pleasant day, especially Sunday, you will see them out all over up & down the bay in swarms—the yachts look beautiful enough, with white sails & many with white hulls & their long pennants flying—it is a new thing to see them so plenty. 11 o'clock Friday forenoon. Pete, I am sitting in my room home, finishing this—have just had a bath, & dressed myself to go over to New York, partly on business—shall go down & put this in the P. O. here—shall walk down as it is a very pleasant forenoon—When you write tell me if you have read Charles Reade's novel of \"Foul Play\"—if not, I have one here I will send you—Dear son, I believe that is all this time—I send my love, dear son, & a good loving kiss—I think of you every day—Give my best regards to all enquiring friends, & inform them I expect to be back in about three weeks—Good bye, my darling boy—from your comrade & father, Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 30 June [1871]"
