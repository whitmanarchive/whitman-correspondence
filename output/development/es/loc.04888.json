Peking,February 3rd—188:My dear Mr. Whitman:—I have seen a paragraph in the press to the effect that you are not in good health.—I was sorry to read it, & trust you will not regard as an intrusion a word of kindness and goodwill from an admirer and a friend, ten thousand miles away.—I was glad to have seen you before I left, and apparently destined to live many, many years.—I trust that what I have read was a mere newspaper exaggeration, and in sending you this wish, I send the assurances of my gratitude & esteem, & pray that it may find you enjoying a very happy New Year.—Yours sincerely,Jno Russell Young.Walt Whitman Esq. John Russell Young to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1883"
