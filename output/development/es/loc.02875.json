    "text": "March 9th 1874With full heart, with eyes wet with tears of joy & I know not what other deep emotion—pain of yearning pity blent with the sense of grandeur, dearest Friend have I read and reread the great sacred Poem just come to me. O august Columbus! whose sorrows sufferings struggles are more to be envied than any triumph of conquering warrior—as I see him in your poem his figure merges into yours, brother of Columbus. Completer of his work, discoverer of the spiritual, the ideal America—you too have sailed over stormy seas to your goal—surrounded with mocking disbelievers—you too have paid the great price of health—our Columbus. Your accents pierce me through & through—Your loving Annie. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 9 March 1874"
