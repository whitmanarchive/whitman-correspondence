    "text": "Cape May City, N.J.,13 May 1890I arrived here at noon today saw Horace for a short time at Camden this morning (as he will have told you). I go to Camden friday morning but have a little business matter to attend to so shall not get around to your house untill[until] say 1 or 2 P.M. (Guess you don't want any one earlier than that any how)—Am much pleased to hear both from Horace and yourself that your health is rather looking up than the reverse—but shall see about that friday. If Mrs Costelloe should get out for 31st thatwould really be immense—It seems almost too good to come true.I like this place so far very well—think I feel better ahead since I came this noon! Quick cure you will say—but then happily there was not much to cure!Your friendRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 13 May 1890"
