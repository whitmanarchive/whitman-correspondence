March 7–1872Dear son,Well I am still here Pete, kept in pretty close quarters by the weather—but it seems to be something of a let up this morning—There is nothing special to write about—but I thought I would send you a line this morning. I sent you a letter two days ago with $10—(the second 10 I have sent) Write me whether you rec'd it all right. I hope you are not discouraged by the way things work on the road—It wont[won't] be very long, now before I shall be back with you—Give my love to Mr. & Mrs. Nash—tell Wash Milburne I wish him success in the \"graduate of Pharmacy\" line, & every thing else—give him my love—Pete, I believe that is all this time, dear baby,Walt—with a kiss from your loving father— Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, [7 March 1872]"
