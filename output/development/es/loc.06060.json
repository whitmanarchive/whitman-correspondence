    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,20 Feb 1887Dear WaltI have your card of 17th Have also had a letter from Mrs O'Connor telling me about O'C.'s exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O'C. It seems O'C.'s doctors are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is now sclerosis the disease has been Sclerosis all along and how the doctors could have thought otherwise (if they did so think) I cannot imagine. It is pitiable to see the poor fellow at this late hour going for \"change of air\" as if that could by any possibility do any good in such a case. However it won't do any harm and the change may rouse him up a little for the time. He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the great thing of course is to save him all the suffering (mental & bodily) possible. All quiet here—Country all grown solid again—splendid wheeling smooth hard roads—cloudy weather—All well here we have just had a good dinner—roast turkey, bread sauce & apple pie—What more could one ask for? We are all looking forward to seeing you here by & by—if the lecture comes off Mrs B. will go with me to New York after you and surely we can bring you home comfortably between us—I have just written to Johnston too about the lecture we want to find out what they are thinking about in New York I guess it will be all right—they surely will not let the chance go by after Phila letting them send a good example last year—I wonder when they are going to mind your hospital article in the Century?Goodbye—we all send love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 Feburary 1887"
