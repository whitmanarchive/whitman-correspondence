    "text": "22nd Feb. 89.Dear Walt W.:—How is the healthy invalid to-day? I rcd mag. of poetry (& re-mailed) & the Chicago paper. Good \"ads\" for you they ought to be. How hard it is to live down a pre-conceived wrong impression! These very numerous articles ought to sell any man's books rapidly.I have just spent an hour or so writing to publishers Gardner & Wilson. Have expressed the MS. to Gardner, after waiting six weeks in vain on Wilson. I dislike him & his ways much. But I tell him it is still not too late if he will say the word. He acts like an imbecile—to me.W S.K.New Electric lamps in Belmont. Beautiful! I have just been out to see the brilliant star-show; noticed the big cherry tree in the lane splashed all over one side with white, & found it was one of the Electric lamps a full quarter of a mile away (on a rise of ground) that caused it. These new lights poetize the night wonderfully don't they? William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 22 February 1889"
