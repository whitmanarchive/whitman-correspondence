Herbert see about the store & have put up soon as convenient,—& have some dry oak wood saved the right length, split & carried up there, & piled in the room. Send me word before the end of the week. I wish much to come—Love to all—Walt Whitman(rec'dreceived yesterday a letter from Wm Rossetti, which I will just enclose—& take again when I come over) Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, [1877]"
