ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,30 Aug 1888I feel quite anxious about the \"Complete Works\" and would like much to hear from you how you will deal with that book. I think: 1 The book should be first class in all aspects2 Price should be $10.3 It should (every copy of it) be autograph4 Should contain a number of pictures5 Should be sold entirely by yourself6 A full advertisement of it should go in \"N.B.\" If you would tell Horace to write me your decision on each of these points you would relieve my mind very muchThere is nothing new or special here, all jogging on the old way.Your friendRM BuckeSee notes Sept 1, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 30 August 1888"
