    "text": "Citizen Office32 BeekmaultN.Y.Aug 19 /67.Walt Whitman Esq.Dear Sir,Many thanks for your volume & the accompanying autograph letter, which I shall have bound with it.May I ask you to write me on what terms you will let us have a poem, (of such length as you choose) for the Citizen? I suppose you would not care to run over a column. I am very anxious to have it, but it would not be fair to ask you to write it, without its being undecided how much the Citizen would be able to pay for it.An early answer would be esteemed a personal favor. Whenever I can do anything for you, let me know.Very truly yoursW. L. Alden(Associate Editor) William Livingston Alden to Walt Whitman, 19 August 1867"
