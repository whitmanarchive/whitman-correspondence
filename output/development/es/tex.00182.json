    "text": "Attorney General's Office,Washington.Jan. 1, 1867Dearest Mother,I have just rec'd your letter—I thought of you during that storm—it was very severe here too, & awful gales of wind one or two nights—The dinner in the Hospital was a complete success—there was plenty, & good too—turkey & four or five kinds of vegetables, & mince pie, &c—then I purchased a large quantity of navy plug, & smoking tobacco, & pipes, &c. and after dinner every body that wanted to, had a good smoke—& I had a lot of oranges, apples, &c. & a large sugar cake for supper—then I read some amusing pieces to them for three quarters of an hour, for a change—& sat down by those who were worst off—&c. &c. Nobody else came in that day. They have a Chaplain, but he is miserable coot, like the rest of his tribe. I have written again to Han— I am writing this in the office, all alone—I am going down to the Hospital for a little while, & to carry some tobacco—& then I am invited to O'Connor's to dinner at 4 o'clock—we are to have cold turkey, hot vegetables, &c—They are going to stay where they are till next March. We have had quite a snow storm here—it is snowing moderately now. Some are out with their sleighs. I am glad to hear such a good account of Eddy. It makes me feel quite satisfied. I had a visit from Bayard Taylor, a few days since.Well good bye for this time, dear mother.Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 1 January 1867"
