    "text": "15 Sunderland StreetSunderlandDec 19, 75Dear FriendI have mailed you and registered there, the following Books and printed matter. a Copy of \"the Bhagavad Gita\" Thompson's translations, (a recent Edition.) Selections from the Sanscrit[Sanskrit] by John Muir D.D. a lecture on English Literature by a Unitarian Minister of Birkenhead (to whom I gave a copy of the Complete Edition of your Poems) lastly the Supplement to our town's paper. I would like you to look over a Sketch by H.C. Andersen on two Candles, its translated by one of your readers here. the other is a Story from Iceland being the first story in said paper, it is also written by a warm friend of yours, he was once Editor of the paper but is now engaged in a larger paper in a neighbouring town, a paper that is quite in advance of all our papers here about entitled the Newcastle Chronicle it has got a Daily as well as weekly issue. I will send you a copy someday of the weekly one so that you may gauge its power and its principles and also contrast it with your own papers for I think there is large room for improvement in—many of them I see. they seem to contain matters of such trivial interest outside of the district they are issued in. now I think your papers ought as a rule to be universal in a lare[large] portion of their there topics. if your National poetry to a large extent is intensely European, I think the papers to large extent are essentially local in there[their] articles, at least with very few exceptions such I find is the case in those I recieve[receive]. the best piece of hopeful outspoken utterance in print I see is the reports of the Free Religious Association of Boston. It seems quite in Keeping with what supposes and expects from the cultureed[cultured] people of your land—but perhaps you dont[don't] see it? so that my reference to it will not be of use to you I help all I can here its circulation. Well I hope you will enjoy our little gift I hope in the perusal of such work you will something akin to the width and depth of your own heart. these are old utterances, yet new to us in this lands. \"the Gita\" is one of my favourite Books it is the gem of all Indian love. it is as wide in its teachings and has deep too as anything I have ever yet seen in printed Book. I have tried hard to induce a few souls to aid in the issue of a cheap universal Edition of it, but have utterly failed. its present publisher been lead to do it, in the hopes it may lead to some such recognition by some of our Literary associations—I read with deepfelt sympathy the slight utterances a E.A. PoeEdgar Allen Poe He and his Works have long been in part dear to me.—but what is it that is not so. and to Carlyle and my own nature too and lastly to you and your teachings. how can one but feel interested and moved by such a Nature and then I ask? How comes the distance in such life as over such Souls? We We poor mortals sit in judgement on such—who know nothing of the nature or the environments of such. I pause in my thoughts on all such, and gaze on them in wonderment—even with aw and silence too.—How much of the Speculations of our time did he not solve, and lies therein embeded[embedded]in these wild wild awful stories of his. Ah! that nature is one that used one's love and deepest sympathy, not our hate and Scorn, as alas too often is given it. your sketch of him in the Storm tossed vessel is very very awful real and true. it made me tremble while I read it.—and I have read it up to friends 3 times who call in to hear the news. bye[by] the way in the photograph you sent me with your Beaver on procurable yet? If so where and what price? The friend whose letter I sent you on your Critique on Burns who lives in London wants a copy. he has seen the one you sent me in 1869. Now lastly I feel glad to see in our papers you have seen Conway again. I once spent a little time pleasantly with him in London in 1873. He's a right noble free spoken man, full of wise helpful energy of all sorts in his neighborhood in London. I regretted his notes on you was so very brief. Will my subscription to your new Edition of your works, if sent you direct to America, be of any real aid in your new effort? let me know I will Thomas Dixon to Walt Whitman, 19 December 1875"
