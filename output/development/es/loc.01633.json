    "text": "1874 or '5431 Stevens st. cor WestCamden,JanJanuary 9. 74?Well Pete, my dear loving boy, I have just come in from a 15 minutes walk outside, with my little dog—it is now ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—the bright sun shining, & the air & every thing as pleasant as one could wish—(after most a week of rainy, dark & disagreeable but warmish weather)—I have the same old story to tell,—& thankful enough to have nothing worse to communicate—it is probable I am really slowly gaining—though I have occasional bad spells yet. Your letter was received—I was thinking whether something could not be done about getting the position of through baggage master—& feel inclined to try for you—(You know there is nothing of that sort done without trying)—Did you get the story \"Rolling Stone,\" I sent by P.O.Post Office?—I have had a visitor from New York this forenoon—an old acquaintance, a printer & foreman, I knew 20 years ago, very sickly & expecting to die, at that time—now quite lively & well, really jolly & magnetic, & good company & a good fellow, (like Parker Milburn)—I have an occasional visitor, but not many—Pete if you see any body coming to Phil.Philadelphia you think I would like to see, give 'em my address—I am glad to see most any one for a change—Your old Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 9 January [1874]"
