    "text": "431 Stevens stStreet—cor WestCamden NNew Jersey U S AmericaMay 5 '761876My dear friend,Yours of April 19 both rec'dreceived—with draft on Drexel & Co. for £28.4—most acceptable. The books, according to list sent, will now be prepared, packed, & sent, (together with your & Mrs. Gilchrist's copies, which have been waiting) probably to London express, of which I will advise you more explicitly by letter to follow this probably within two or three days. I repeat what I have already written you—accept all subscriptions—all will be supplied, upon remittance—(I am already putting another small edition to press)—the price will invariably be $10 the set—$5 each Vol. can be had separately, or together, as wanted—Each will contain portraits & my autograph. The Two, Leaves and Rivulets comprise my complete works (the latter Vol. as you see, includes Memoranda of the War as a constituent part.) I do not approve of Mr Conway's letter of April 4—it was unneeded, hurtful to my case, & join'djoined with his allusions to the matter in his public American correspondence, an insult to Mr Buchanan, through me—as such I decidedly resent & disavow it—Every point in B'sBuchanan's March 11 letter to the News, is well taken, & true without exception—particularly all about the American critics, publishers, editors, \"poets\" &c—even what he says about my \"impoverishment\" is much, much nearer the truth than Mr Conways and Lord Houghton's rose-colored illusion varnish—if Mr C. instead of intellectual possessed sympathetic delicacy & insight (I don't think he possesses either) he could have divined better about me & my affairs, not only now here in Camden, but times past in the beginning.I send my love & thanks to W B Scott—I shall try to write a line to him, to C W Reynell, to J L Warren, to A G Dew-Smith, & one or two others, soon as I can. I heartily thank my good friends of the Secularist. I am glad you printed off, & furnish'dfurnished friends with copies of my letter of March 17—upon reading it in print, I find it exactly describes the situation, & my wishes—& I reëndorse it—(if you have any copies spare, send me two or three more in next paper you send.) The drafting on Drexel & Co. the Philadelphia bankers, is perfectly convenient to me. I am feeling pretty comfortable as I write—have been out a little nearly every day for a week—some days across the river here, the broad Delaware—This is one of my good mornings (it is now between 8 and 9) have finished my breakfast, coffee, Graham bread & mutton chop—good night's sleep, last night.—occupy myself two or three hours every day when not too ill, with my book business, letters, &c—also with the baby boy, my brother's 6 months infant, very fine & bright, (of course)—takes much of my time, & is a delightful diversion to me—the young one knows me so well, & is always happy when tended by me—& so, my dear friend, good bye for this time—& God bless you & yours.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 5 May 1876"
