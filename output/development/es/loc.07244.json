    "text": "Superintendent's Office. ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,20 Sept 1888I never saw a more pleasant fall here so far—hardly a break in our beautiful weather now for a month. Today as fine as ever. I am struggling with my report and getting on slowly—it will be much longer than usual—a lot about alcohol in it. We are all very well—Maurice and Willy have gone a hundred miles west with their uncle Willy Gurd (the meter inventor) for a few days shooting, they will all be back tomorrow evening or night, I am in hopes they will bring a lot of partridge and wild duck with them.As to the meter we are making arrangements about getting our patents pretty much all over the world. As soon as our patenting is done we expect to astonish the water works people. I am more and more impressed with the immense value of the meter think it will (as soon as known, at least until improved upon, if that can be) stand alone as the only meter to be used—seems to me so far ahead of all others in all ways—efficiency, simplicity, above all cheapness. I have not heard from you for a week, hope you are not feeling worse? How do the books get along? Will they be ready by the first Oct.?Your friendRM BuckeSee notes 9/22/88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 September 1888"
