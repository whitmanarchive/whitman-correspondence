    "text": "38 Marlborough HillSt. John's WoodLondon S.W.26 January, 1876.My dear Sir,Some years ago when IhadI had occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy to hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever concerns you have rather strengthened than weakened, IfeelI feel sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.As a faithful student of your books, IhaveI have made it my business to obtain every edition I could, and all portraits and notable accounts and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able to see ever,â€”that mentioned by Rossetti as having been issued in 1856 in 16 ms .The American agent to whom my last application for this was forwarded says: \"I don't think there is an 1856 edition. There is one earlier or later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25 $ to 30 $; but I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the above\".Can you tell me whether there is or not an edition between the one set up by yourself in 1855 and that of Thayer & Eldridge dated 1860-61? If there is, can you give me any particulars that will help me towards buying it? Also, what is the edition that fetches 25 $ to 30 $? Not that of 1855; for I hear that can be had for 3 or 4.When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's a few weeks ago, I saw a proof of a fine portrait of you engraved by Linton: may I ask what it is from, and where it is published?I live in hopes of publishing some day a good hybrid edition of your works; and my enquiries about editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my experience is that the careful collations of various versions of a poet's work is often a key as well as an incitement to the right understanding of his spirit and intent.I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelly which will be the handsomest in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published; and that takes up most of my time.With best wishes, believe me to be, dear sir, faithfully yours,H Buxton FormanWalt Whitman Esq Harry Buxton Forman to Walt Whitman, 26 January 1876"
