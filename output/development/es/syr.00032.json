    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden New JerseyThursday noonMay 26 '86Dear friendYour letter came yesterday—also the liquorice powder—I have no doubt the powder will be good for me. I have already begun it—I am as well as usual with me—up, and at my window, as now—get out with the horse & wagon every afternoon but shall not to-day—nothing new in my affairs—get along quite comfortably—have some visitors—a canny Scotchman, a literary man, but a good jovial fellow, elderly with a humorous turn, & much reminiscence, has been in this forenoon to see me—I like to have him—It is a raw, dark, rainy day—I wish I could have you here to eat a bite of dinner with me, & chat for the afternoon—Several of my friends have had your little book, lent them by me—Scovel (with his lawyer's head) said to me after reading it, \"there can be no doubt of it\"—i e that B[acon] is the true author—W. W. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 26 May 1886"
