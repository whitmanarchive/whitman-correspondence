Days, & Nov. B—all & several condensed in one—this is now going through the presses—your bust of me still holds out fully in my estimation.—I consider it (to me at any rate) the best & most characteristic really artistic & satisfactory rendering of any—so tho't by me.—the bust of Elias Hicks pleases & satisfies me first rate—goes to the right spot—the little arm chair statuette is here (as when you left it) & must not be forgotten—it is valuable exceedingly—Horace is invaluable to me—I couldn't have done anything with the printing without him—Whether I shall get out of this slough remains uncertain—I am comfortable—Love to you & all inquiring friendsWalt WhitmanWhitman.
