    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,6 April 1889I have had the Inspector here since thursday evening—he went East (to Toronto) this morning. All quiet again and nobody hurt—This morning I got the little bundle of papers (Aug. 87) from you, many thanks. We have had another fall of snow yesterday and last night, quite a lot came down, several inches. It is now (under the influence of quite a warm sun) departing as rapidly as it came, by tomorrow evening (if the weather keeps as now) it will be all gone. I am still reading Brockden Brown and he interest me a good deal, more than I had expected. No letters from any of our friends and no news. I trust you are easier—I wish I could in any way make you more comfortable, perhaps by & by I shall be ableYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 April 1889"
