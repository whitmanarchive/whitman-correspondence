    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,7 Dec 1888I have your letter of 5.30 P.M. wednesday (5th) and am greatly releived at the result of the consultation as far as I understand it at present. I had a letter, also by this mornings mail, from Osler written 5th but before the consultation it is however very cheering—I want to impress upon you however that you certainly should be seen (for the present) every day by some good doctor who would call in Osler from time to time as necessary. Osler agrees with me that this would be the proper thing to do. You had better take some clever young (at least not old) Camden man for the regular daily attendant. Thank you very much for \"Shakespeare-Bacon's Cipher\" It is too bad that it was missed out of \"Sands\" for it is a good piece.I am confident that your present painful symptoms can be greatly alleviated (if not removed) by careful management but you must be seen at least once a day in order that you may be closely watched and the proper steps taken at once from day to day—I want you to show this letter to Traubel to save me repeating it to himAlways affectionatelyR M BuckeSee notes Dec 9, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 7 December 1888"
