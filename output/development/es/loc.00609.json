    "text": "CorrySept 5th 1865Dear FriendYour letter of Aug 26th reached me in due time. I had began to think (allmost[almost]) that you had forgotten me. Then I imagined that some press of work had prevented your writing me sooner. Well as for myself (And I have nothing elese[else] to write about) I am at work on a Farm at present. And managing to save $30.00 per month. Considerable leisure time, entertaining Books, good company. My employer is at home but a very small portion of his time. Have enjoyed myself pretty well (Hard times when I cannot) considering that I am Just from so much excitement when compared with this. Have been reading, Our Old Home (by Nathaniel Hawthorne,) Home and Abroad (by B. Taylor) Color Guard (by J. R. Hosmer) all light reading but entertaining, for news I have the Buffalo Express (daily). So you see dear friend that I am pretty well provided for. I should like very much to see you and be with you.Corry is a pretty rough place. Property is very valuable. it is the Junction of three R.R. Atlantic & Great Western, Pa & Erie and Oil Creek. Large Refineries, Saw Mills, ManufactorysManufacturers are located here and doing a flourishing Business. Lots with the stumps & logs on are sold at the rate of $40.00 per foot.This winter I shall either learn a trade of go to School, I shall be governed by circumstances.The Weather is very warm for this time of the season considerable rain has fallen lately but the weather is quite pleasant nevertheless.Seems to me you are about to leave Washington in its most pleasant season. I was allmost[almost] delighted with the fall of the year in that climate.Dont[Don't] have any good pictures here. People are thinking more of money here than of Beauty.Sometimes I have disputes with the detested Copperheads. I treat them rather uncivilly. Havent[Haven't] any special regard for them.I hope you will write me a long letter. Your letter was very interesting to meâ€”very valuable. Well Good Old Friend I must bid you good night.B SutherlandCorry Pa Byron Sutherland to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1865"
