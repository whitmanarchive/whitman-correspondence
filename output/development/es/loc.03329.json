    "text": "The Union League ClubNew York,7th June, 1888.Dear Walt Whitman,These last days have been so crowded with work & play, that there has been no fair chance to do any writing. What with Stedman—who celebrated my last night in America yesterday by toasting me with mint-juleps at the Hoffman House, & Col. Bob Ingersoll, who has been giving me all sorts of wrinkles in oratory at his own house & in public (It was a great experience to hear him speak to an audience of actors at Madison Square Theatre on Tuesday,)—& what with endless other episodes of a friendly & delightful kind, it is a wonder that I have the heart to say goodbye to America at all. At last the end has come however. I sail by the Crystal this afternoon at 3 o'clock for Leith, & with this news I must now say once more Goodbye, & be silent again for a while.With much love!Ernest RhysRemember me to Mrs. Davies! Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 7 June 1888"
