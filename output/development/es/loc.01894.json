    "text": "Louisville,Octo. 17th 1866My dear Mr. Whitman;Herewith you will three dollars, the price of the copy of Leaves of Grass which I have just received—I am greatly obliged for this copy, but still more thankful to you for having written the Book. I know that the narrow minded of this world will depreciate & condemn it,— let your consolation be that the world is growing & will at last appreciate the great thoughts contained in it—You say that every thing is going on in the office as when I left—Have you not received a permanent place? I have deeply regretted the fact, that I did not know your place to be temporary till after my resignation—I most earnestly desired Mr. Stanbery to give you an office—It is very agreeable to receive much kind remembrances from the gentlemen in the office—I am sure that I have not more of their esteem and love than they have of mine —Bee[Be] good enough to say so to them—I will deliver your message to Charley—He is hard at work in a drug store with a very sore eye from carelessly handling of some acid—The late elections in the Northern States have made a profound & I trust an improving impression in Ky—With kindness and friendshipI am most trulyJames SpeedWalt Whitman, Esq.WashingtonWalt Whitman,Atty Genl's officeWashington—from James SpeedOct. 17, 1866 James Speed to Walt Whitman, 17 October 1866"
