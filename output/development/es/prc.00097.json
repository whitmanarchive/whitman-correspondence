    "text": "Editor Herald.Dear Sir:Would like to have say a four or five column article for the paper embodying the poems, &c. of my new book \"Two Rivulets,\" to publish say eight or ten days before their issue by me?—making a resume of the book in advance giving the principal pieces, (hitherto unpublished—& to be first printed in said article.) If so, I will make out such an article & send you, for your determination. The price would be $200.I have thought that as you like to have things in advance—& also to give variety to the paper—such a proposition might be acceptable. If not, no harm done.WW Walt Whitman to the Editor of the New York Herald, [January 1876]"
