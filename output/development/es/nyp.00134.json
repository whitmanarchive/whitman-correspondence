O'Connor Dr. Sir,I received this morning yours of March 14th—I am deeply sensible of the interest you have taken for me and return my sincere and heartfelt thanks for it. The position—although very desirable in all respects is one that I am not in the least qualified to fill—it is an entirely different branch of the profession from that in which I have been engaged—My Engineering education and entire experience has been in the construction of work[s], such as laying out masonry, location and the general superintendance[superintendence] of building a piece of work—As a draughtsman I am totally deficient—my efforts in that direction being limited entirely to a rough pencil sketch to convey the idea of what is wanted to the workman—Therefore I am certain that I am not qualified and could not justify your generous recommendation of me for the appointmentHoping sir, that I may some time personally thank you for the trouble you have taken and kindness shown me I am very respectfullyYours CdiallyCordially Thos J. Whitman Thomas Jefferson Whitman to William Douglas O'Connor, 16 March 1865"
