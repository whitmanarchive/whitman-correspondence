    "text": "12 Well RdHampstead, LondonEngland1888June16thI feel very sad about dear old WaltsWalt's illness.The two telegrams in the London \"Daily News\" are so alarming—I fear I shall never see him again; I've half a mind to start off now to Philadelphia.If you see Walt again in this world after receiving this letter, give him my love.Write to me as soon as you get this if it's only a few lines.Tell me about your own health, how much work are you doing every day. Can I be of use? I wish I could be of more comfort to you.I am coming to America about the middle of August.I hope that you are not working just the same as you did last summer. You must remember what the doctors told you.It will not do for you to be ill again. I feel horribly anxious about your health!Let me know if you require anything. I hope it will not be very hot in America in August. What I recollect of it last year, was that it began to \"let up\" in August cool nights, and that sort of thing.Mrs. Pearsall has told me of a nice little studio in Chestnut street high up that is only about $75 a year, which would just suit me. My idea is to hire a studio & one other room in Chestnut street, & to get my meals out at different cheap restaurants I, dare say, I could get a meal for 25 cents, and in the colder weather I could cook my own breakfast or at any rate my tea on my studio stove? So I shall bring a few cooking utensils & a few other things. I want to make drawings of street scenes in Philadelphia and during the election in November—and maybe, also, that I shall travel to other cities a little during the elections. It is possible, also, that I may get work to do in connection with in:—Cherry street Academy of Fine Arts, but of that I am not certain.I am getting on with my portrait of Mrs. Costelloe; I reckon to finish it before I leave England, and to leave it behind all ready for next year's Govenor of Royal Academy.She is a light hearted fine lady, talks to me in a lively strain during the sitting, but she is so superficial, every time one dips the oar of conversation in, I seem to scrape the sandy bottom!! And would you believe, that Westminster is five good miles from our house and at 2 O.C. she leaves me to get home as best I can, & to get a lunch where I can; there is no inhospitality like that of a fine lady from Germantown, however, no one will know when they look at her blooming cheeks on my canvas that the artist painted it on an empty stomach; at least so my sister laughs, and says.The Smiths, who have just arrived from Philadelphia tell me that Dr. Bucke procured Walt a man nurse; which was just what the dear old fellow wanted, I was so glad to hear it.Of my two friends across the pond no one knows how much I think and feel & how little I say. I haven't written to Walt yet since his illness for I thought he might be too ill to open my letter. I have just received your second letter dated June 14th as well as the former in wch you spoke of your great loss. I received the former a week or 2 weeks ago. My dear friend, are you going through this hot summer without a servant?—and doing all the work yourself? Tell me; and tell me have you a return of any of your old ailments because the doctors will shake their heads if you have—you must be careful.I hope that I shall be able to be some comfort to my friends during my visit to the States.I can't very well manage to write a family letter this time as I want this to catch this afternoon's mail. Mrs. Costelloe's portrait is coming on, and I think that it will do me credit & do think that I may see Walt yet in the flesh. I do rejoice in his recovery; Debbie gives very hopeful account of him, at wch I am so pleased.Answer my question Madam, do you want anything?It has been quit hot here: so hot that I lay awake all last night. I am so glad to hear that Mr. S's strawberries promise so well. We have had lots of rain. Where has Van gone?Grace is going to give a large party 75 people here next Saturday—week probably the day that you will receive this, between 8:30 and 12:30 in the evening.Herb.Tell me more about your health and spirits? I can't think how Ed & Mr S can work out in the blazing sun? Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 16 June 1888"
