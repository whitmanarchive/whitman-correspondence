    "text": "Dear WW.Did you see my snow study \"Tumultuous Privacy,[\"] last monday in Transcript for 6?Every emendation of yrs is good. I rather doubted at first yr sub=head. But I guess it's better than mine, (wh' was too big=headed for the main structure). Your other touches give accuracy to my over=statements. Really I was unfit to treat the subject[.] Howsoever, we've together hammered out a bit of wrought=iron work of some value. I never said anything just like it for fact=iness. The thing grew upon both of us, as we went on. Somebody ought to write a scholarly=picturesque thorough & exhaustive history of the Dutch=Americans. I wish I were rich enough. I wdâ€” go to Albany & the pastoral horse=raising regions of New York State, & to N.Y. City & L. Island, & study the Dutch people at first hand. I remember years ago I had a splendid clean young Dutch commerical fellow as a pupil in Brooklyn, N.Y. I taught him English through the medium chiefly of German.W.S.K.(over)I'm afraid with that rebellious bowel business your experience must be something like that of an old Scotchman I heard of who was opposed to having water closets in the middle of a house.\"Mr Whatcomb [Whitcomb]\" said he, \"I dont like 'em. A man can't make a bet of wand without being heard all over the house\"! William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 1 February 1891"
