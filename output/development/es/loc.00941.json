    "text": "Sat. Nov. 21st400 L StreetDear Walt,Many thanks for your long good letter, which I am not going now to answer. I write at the request of Charlie Eldridge who said that he should be too busy to-day to do so, to tell you that he and Mrs. Cooper are to leave here either in the 8 A.M. or the 11 A.M. train on Monday next, for Philadelphia, and he is to remain at her house that night. They want you to leave New York so as to meet them, and stay at her house too. Her residence is No. 1429 Girard Avenue, between Broad & 15th Streets.Mrs. Cooper has been coaxing, persuading, begging, entreating, commanding even William to go on with them too, but he says he can't , & I know him well enough to know that she can't move him. She wants me to go on also, but I know that I shall not unless some strong pressure is brought to bear between now & Monday, for I can see that William does not want to spare me.They fully count upon seeing you. Charlie will remain at Mrs. C's till Tuesdayevening. By the way—he got your letter, & was delighted with it, he said it was worthy to be set in a gold frame & to which Wm. & I assented most heartily.Dear Walt, we long for you, William sighs for you, & I feel as if a large part of myself were out of the city,—I shall give you a good big kiss when you come, so depend upon it.My love to your good, noble mother, whom I shall some day know. Kiss her for me—& tell her that I love her boy Walt. I want to see those splendid children too. But I shall some day. Good bye.No more now, but if you are not back in a few days I will write you a good long letter, and answer yours fully.Oh! do you know that Mrs. Howells is in New York, has been there a week. With love from all—Yours Nelly. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 21 November 1863"
