    "text": "Am Hof,Davos Platz,SwitzerlandAugust 3 1890My dear MasterI received your card of July 20 in due course two days ago. It makes me feel how very remiss I have been in not acknowledging the volume of your Complete Works, which I am already in the habit of calling to myself \"Whitman's Bible,\" & which remains the colossal monument of your arduous life-labours—monumentum aere perennius, as Horace says.Reading this great book, I found on P: 291 in \"Collect\" the passage I quoted from the essay known to me under its old title of \"Poetry of the Future\". But it was then too late to alter the reference in my own essay on \"Democratic Art\" w. had been printed a considerable time before it was published. I hope to have a second edition of my \"Essays Speculative & Suggestive\" (for only 750 copies were printed); & if I do so, I shall remodel the whole drift of that article.Now I must thank you for the generous & tome most highly acceptable, by me most reverently guarded, gift of your portraits—a sheaf of portraits unique in their significance & interest. Many friends have shared with me the pleasure & profit of studying & comparing them. If you have no objection to the idea, I should like to have some of the photographs of middle & later life reproduced by a permanent process, which has recently been invented by a very able chemist at Munich: Obernetter. I will send you a specimen of his skill, the reproduction of one of Rembrandt's etchings, which will bear the closest comparison with the original.I want next to ask you a question about a very important portion of your teaching, which has puzzled a great many of your disciples & admirers. To tell the truth, I have always felt unable to deal, as I wish to do, comprehensively with your philosophy of life, because I do not even yet understandthe whole drift of \"Calamus.\" If you have read Mr. Havelock Ellis' \"New Spirit\", w. contains a study of your work in thought & speculation, you may have noticed on p: 108 that he expresses some perplexity about the doctrine of \"manly love\", & again p: 121 he uses this phrase \"the intimate & physical love of comrades & lovers\".This reference to Havelock Ellis helps me to explain what it is I want to ask you. In your conception of comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions & actions which no doubt do occur between men? I do not ask, whether you approve of them, or regard them as a necessary part of the relation? But I should much like to know whether you are prepared to leave them to the inclinations & the conscience of the individuals concerned?For my own part, after mature deliberation, I hold that the present laws of France & Italy are right upon this topic of morality. They place the personal relations of adults of both sexes upon the same foundation: that is to say,they protect minors, punish violence, & guard against outrages of public decency. Within these limitations, they leave individuals to do what they think fit. But, as you know, these principles are in open contradiction with the principles of English (and I believe American) legislation.It has not infrequently occurred to me among my English friends to hear your \"Calamus\" objected to, as praising & propagating a passionate affection between men, which (in the language of the objectors) has \"a very dangerous side\", & might \"bring people into criminality\".Now: it is of the utmost importance to me as your disciple, & as one who wants sooner or later to diffuse a further knowledge of your life-philosophy by criticism; it is most important to me to know what you really think about all this.I agree with the objectors I have mentioned that, human nature being what it is, & some men having a strong natural bias towardpersons of their own sex, the enthusiasm of \"Calamus\" is calculated to encourage ardent & physical intimacies.But I do not agree with them in thinking that such a result would be absolutely prejudicial to social interests, which I am certain that you are right in expecting a new Chivalry (if I may so speak) from one of the main & hitherto imperfectly developed factors of the human emotional nature. This, I take it, is the spiritual atome of your doctrine in Calamus.And, as I have said, I prefer the line adopted by French & italian legislature to that of the English penal code.Finally, what I earnestly desire to know is whether you are content to leave the ethical problems regarding the private behaviour of comrades toward each other, to the person' own sense of what is right & fit—or whether, on the other hand, you have never contemplated while uttering the Gospel of Comradeship, the possibility of any such delicate difficulties occurring.Will you enlighten me on this? If I am not allowed to hear from yourself or from some one who will communicate your views, I fear I shall never beable to utter what I want to tell the world about your teaching, with the confidence & thorough sense of not misinterpreting you in one way or the other which are inseparable from truly sympathetic & powerful exposition.The precise drift of \"Whoever you are\"—what the one indispensible thing is—I cannot get at; & I am not sure what the drift of \"Earth my likeness\" is.—Ah, if I could only once have spoken to you, you would certainly have let me know.—Lieber Mann, geehrter Meister, das fehlt mir doch!—It is perhaps strange that a man within 2 months of completing his 50th year should care at all about this ethical bearing of Calamus. Of course I do not care much about it, except that ignorance on the subject presents me from forming a complete view of your life-philosophy.Believe me truly gratefully & affectionately yoursJohn Addington Symonds John Addington Symonds to Walt Whitman, 3 August 1890"
