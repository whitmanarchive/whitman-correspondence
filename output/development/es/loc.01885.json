    "text": "56 Easton Sq.London, N. W.23 Decr. /75Dear Mr. Whitman,It was a great pleasure to me to see your handwriting (letter of 19 Oct.)—likewise to make the acquaintance of Mr. Marvin, whom we all found most pleasant and sensible. The only disappointment was his short sojourn over here: for, as soon as he had called on us with your letter (wh.which was about 1 Dec., I think) he went over to Paris & then, after returning & dining with us, another day or two saw him on his way homeward acroſs the Atlantic. I dare say he has told you (if opportunity served) something about the evening he paſsed with us & a few friends—good Whitmanites most of them. Let me see whether I can remember the names. Mr. Marvin took down to dinner our dear & admirable friend Mrs. Gilchrist (who lately lost her mother, aged more than 90, & expects to see her eldest son happily married pretty soon): I found Mr. M. was not aware (& perhaps you are not) that Mrs. G. is the widow of a literary man of some name, Alex. Gilchrist, author of the Life of the Great ideal painter-poet Wm.William Blake, & of the Life of the painter Etty: he died young of a scarlet fever in 1861. Next Mr. M. was Jos.Joseph Knight, Editor of the Sunday Times, theatrical critic of the athenaeum, &: a man of excellent critical capacity, who knows your value. Then Miſs Mathilde Blind, stepdaughter of the German revolutionist of 1848, a woman of singular ability & independence of mind, & a most earnest believer in the author of Leaves of Graſs. Next, Justin McCarthyJustin McCarthy, one of the foremost writers in the Daily News, & a novelist of much talent: he has been more than once in America—also his wife. Then my father–in–law Ma–doxMadox–Brown the historical painter, & his wife. Lastly E. W. Goſse & his bride : the former a poet of these more recent years, who has done some graceful things, & has much knowledge & good perception as a critic: Mrs. Goſse was lately Miſs Ellen Epps , belonging to a family of medical homeopathists, & is herself a painter of no ordinary talent. Her sister married a painter of European fame, Alma–Tadema , a dutchman now naturalized in England.—But perhaps I am peppering my letter with a lot of details that are not much to your purpose. Mr. Marvin informed me that your works, in their various forms, are in the Congreſsional Li–braryLibrary at Washington, but not my vol.volume of selections, & that he wd.would like to see the latter added to the series: so, not having a new copy at hand, I delivered to him my own (not yet shabby) copy of the selections, & he will present it to the Library.My father–in–law has, I know, ordered the publishers (Tinsley Brothers) to send you a copy of the Literary Remains of his son, just published: the youthful author died rather more than a year ago. I think the book will present to you evidences of uncommon faculty. You will see on the title–page the names of myself & of F. Hueffer (husband of my wife's half–sister) as editors. The memoir however is written principally by the fatherI was very glad to see you attended the Edgar Poe celebration, from wh.which other men who ought to have been presented were blameably[blamably] (I shd.should say) absent: & I read with great interest your printed remarks regarding Poe's genius. To me he has always been a fascinating writer—not of course that I am blind to his blemishes & perversities: the poem named To Annie is, I think, great—even deserving preference above The Raven.I cd.could say a good deal more: but occupations preſs & I want to get this off (28 Dec. now) without further delay. Believe how warmly I & others in this country, near or not so near to me, feel regarding you. Are you ever to come to my land? & if so w.dwould you not house with us for some portion at least of your sojourn?Yours always,W. M. Roſsetti William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 23 December 1875"
