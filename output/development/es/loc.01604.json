    "text": "Sarnia,December 19, 1870.Walt Whitman,Dear Sir:Will you please send to the enclosed address two copies of \"Leaves of Grass\", one copy of \"Passage to India\" and one copy of \"Democratic Vistas\". Enclosed you will find $7.25—$6.75 for the books and $0.50 for postage. I do not know exactly what this last item will be but I fancy $0.50 will be enough to pay it.I am an old reader of your works, and a great admirer of them.About two years ago I borrowed a copy of the 1855 edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" and I have a great ambition to own a copy of this edition myself; would it be possible to get one? Before getting that the only thing I had ever seen of yours was Rossetti's selection. Lately I have got a copy of the 1867 edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" and I have compared the \"Walt Whitman\" in that with the same poem in the 1855 edition and I must say I like the earlier edition best.I have an idea that I shall be in Washington in the course of 1871 & if I am it would give me much pleasure to see you, if you would not object, I am afraid; however, that, like other celebrities, you have more people call upon you than you care about seeing & in that case I shall not wish to annoy you—At all eventsBelieve meFaithfully yours,R. M. Bucke—AddressDr. R. Maurice BuckeSarniaOntarioCanada Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 19 December 1870"
