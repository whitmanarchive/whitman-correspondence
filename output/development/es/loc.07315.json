    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,9 Sept 1889Still keeps warm here. Quite warm indeed the last week and still so this morning though the nights are getting cool. Yours of 4th came on Saturday, I was very glad to hear that you are keeping fairly well—I trust it may last. Now that the hot weather is about over I have great hopes of you. We (Mrs. B. Clare, some friends & self) drove to Delaware yesterday—had a pleasant visit there and a most charming drive home by moonlight. I have had a plain, very neat, oak frame, with a good mat, put on the new Photo'—it sets it off well and will keep it clean—it is a magnificent portrait, I do not know that any of the paintings touch it—I do not think I ever saw a photo' with so much expression in the eyes. The picture came in perfect order—Dickwas careful of it you may be sure R M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 September 1889"
