    "text": "Washington,October 19, 1867.F. P. Church.My dear Sir:I send the article on Democracy. If satisfactory I should like $100 for it. You are to issue it in Galaxy with exclusive possession of the field, say for three months—after which I reserve to myself the right of any further use of it—as, for instance, issuing it with added Notes, Appendices, &c. in a pamphlet or small book—published by you, of course, if you are willing—I to receive copyright fee on sales, &c. &c.But we can see better how the cat jumps after the article is before the public—& will leave that question open until then.Please have it set up forthwith, read carefully by copy, & then, after correction, send me two good proofs. I want it to go forth in a perfect verbal &c. condition.Walt Whitman.Please acknowledge this, immediately on reception.If any thing could be made by disposing of advance sheets in London, to any magazine or publisher, I would suggest that it be done—the price procured to be divided equally between you & me.W. Walt Whitman to Francis P. Church, 19 October 1867"
