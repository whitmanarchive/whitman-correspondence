Every thing goes on with me same as before—McKay has just been here & paid me $55.64 for royalties of last six months—I am going to print a small special ed'n of L of G. with Sands at Seventy & Backward Glance as epilogue & am busying myself at it (to commemorate my finishing my 70th year)—Best love—W W Walt Whitman to William D.
