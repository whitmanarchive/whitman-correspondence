    "text": "54 Manchester Road Bolton111 Engle St BoltonMay 18th/87.Dear Walt,In no less familiar or colder terms can we bring ourselves to address you, the most loved of friends, though such a salutation from strangers to anyone but yourself would seem an impertinenceWe, two friends chiefly united by our common love of you, wish to congratulate you on your birthday and express to you personally our very best wishes and love. To you we owe not only affection but endless gratitude and reverence. One of us, a doctor, owes to you entirely his spiritual enfranchisement & deliverance from soul-benumbing scepticism, into which, not without pain, he had gradually fallen. Your books are his constant companions, his spiritual nourishment, his continual study and delight. And not least of his debts to you is \"the glory\" you have shown him, \"in his daily walk & trade\" which you have ennobled and made beautiful for him.The writer in many obstructions & difficulties is strengthened and comforted by your example and words. In past heavy bereavement (of a mother to whom he has often mentally applied the words you use of yours) your words have best tallied his deepest experience and hopes. For years he has been, and is, a lover and grateful student of Carlyle and, in turn, of Ruskin. He has also, on the other hand been long familiar with Emerson and reveres his memory. But your teaching, far more than Emerson's, has appealed to him as the fitting offset to and complement of theirs, and as a veritable \"Gospel\" bringing \"glad tidings of great joy.\"We both study your writings as much as possible, and glean every help that critiques and notices can give. We endeavor to assimilate them in our lives and try to introduce them to others. We occasionally call friends together in your name to spend \"a Whitman evening\", to read your books and talk about them. We shall not fail to do so on the 31st, and shall rejoice to believe that you know it and that there is a real communion between us, though far sunderedWe are anxious to have the pleasure of giving you some little tangible token of our love. We do not know what else to send you so venture to ask you to accept a money present of Â£10. It will be a lifelong pleasure to us to feel that we have thus been in personal communication with you and that something you hold has been supplied by us.Hoping you will do us this favour, and wishing you long continued health and strength. We are,Yours gratefully and affectionatelyJohn Johnston M.D.J. W. Wallace. James William Wallace and John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 18 May 1887"
