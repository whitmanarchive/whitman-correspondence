    "text": "DetroitJune 18th 1880169 East Elizabeth StStreetMy Dear Friend—I am greatly obliged for your Book and have been exceedingly interested—also I rec'dreceived the Paper—The hospitals during the War, were in my mind and heart so much I could but feel the distress of the homesickness of the poor fellows—when the news came to me, that my Boy was wounded, I said \"Oh tell me that he is dead. I can stand that—for it would be my own suffering, but I cant endure to think of Percy as wounded in the Hospital and homesick—it was at night the news came to us that he was wounded, perhaps fatally and all the night I lay in such distress—but the next morning—when I was hurrying them off to Pontiac my son in law came to me (I saw that no horse was hot out of the Stable)—and he laid his head on my shoulder and said, \"Mother you said you could bear to hear that Percy was dead—but not that he was wounded and living\"—\"Yes\" I said, \"I could\"—then he said, \"he is dead\" and I felt a sort of thankfulness to know that it was my sorrow not his—I hope that you recdreceived my story of \"Leaves of Grass\"—I and my family had hoped to have seen you before this—and now—we are unexpectedly call'd away—for some weeks—& we shall still hope to see you—when we can—I will let you know, for I want to welcome you to our home—before you leave CanadaWith thanks I am yours trulyElisa S Leggett— Elisa Seaman Leggett to Walt Whitman, 18 June 1880"
