    "text": "Boston.Princeton St. 93..27../89Dear FriendYou were so good as to call yourself so, in my book,—that I value more than you guess,—and may I not claim you now?If you received all the letters I write you mentally, you would have sufficient kindling for a long Winter. I do even begin them upon paper, but words, that I know how to put together, seem so weak against the truth of which I wish to speak, that the unfinished letter goes into the waste basket, first torn into inch pieces. On yesterday I sent some flowers to speak for me. They know how to talk without tiring you. They can speak of divine things without mockery. They can speak of tenderness, without annoying you. They can talk with you of \"India\"—of \"more than India\"—and you will understand each other. I do not know what flowers you love best. If I were arranging flowers for your room, I should have masses of one kind, if I could. In this case, I thought a few sprays of the more delicate miracles, quite a variety of them, might enable you to fancy you had left your room, and were picking them as you walked. I wanted to see them put in the box, but the kind hearted man who held them in his care assured me they had better remain unpacked till just before the express train left Boston. The dear little crocuses I picked from my own tiny spot of earth, and sent each one laden with loving wishes. May they carry their messages safely.I wonder if you have an idea how much I enjoyed being with you—or how hard it was for me to leave you.(I worried after leaving, lest I had stayed too long a time and wearied you.) I have longed to see you as I never longed to see the Alps. There seemed no prospect of my going. The way seemed hedged. Then—a friend opened the gate and let me through. I have not called on Mrs. Fairchild yet. I have been too busy, but am anticipating the pleasure soon. How good it will be to speak with her of you.Good bye—good bye—God bless you ever—ever—!Sometime America will know what you have done for her. In the meantime, souls, here and there, in sorrow and in gladness, think of you and love you.With deep gratitudeA.H. Spaulding Ada H. Spaulding to Walt Whitman, 27 March 1889"
