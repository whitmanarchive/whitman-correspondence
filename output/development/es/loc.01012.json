    "text": "Malden,June 25th, 1860.O rare Walt Whitman! I said I would write to you about your Book when I found time to read it as it was written to be read. But I take back my promise. For if you are not sane what will writing avail? and if you are sane your writings are alive with richest sanity. Now, if I do not understand them, or any parts of them, what good will it do to say soâ€”silence, it seems to me, is a duty till I do understand them; and then again, if I do understand them, or when I shall do so, what good will it do to tell you of the fact? It is a waste of breath for my friend to tell me I am healthy when my pulse records the circumstance so often every minute.I love you, Walt! A Conquering Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp. Ever and trulyJames Redpath. James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 25 June 1860"
