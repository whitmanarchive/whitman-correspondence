    "text": "Esopus, NYNew York,AugAugust 17, 831883Dear Walt:Drop me a line where & how you are, & what your plans are for the fall.We are just back from Roxbury where we went in July. We are all pretty well. I rec'dreceived Dr BuckesDr.Bucke's book & thank you for it. I had already purchased & read it. I cannot say that I care much for what DrDr. Bucke has to say; he gives me no new hint or idea. Wm O'ConnorsWilliam O'Connor's letter is a treat, with a little too much seasoning. If WmWilliam would only practice a little more self-denial, he would be much more effective. He could write so that his critics could not laugh at him.The review of the book in the Tribune, was by a woman—a Miss H—(I forget her name) regularly employed upon the paper. The latter part of June Gilder & I went to Concord & spent a couple of days there, called on MrsMrs. Emerson, liked her much, supped & breakfasted with Sanborn & had a pleasant time. Young DrDr. Emerson, seems a worthy son of his father. I liked him much.If we ever get another girl in this house & the kitchen machinery running smoothly again, I shall come for you & take no denial. I think it would lengthen my days to see you once more.With loveJohn Burroughssee notes June 30 1888 John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 17 August 1883"
