Prof. Wm James would like you to be his guest if you can see your way to accept the Signet invitation. The society of course pays your expenses to and from Cambridge.You may be pleased to know that Mr. Ernest Rhys is to lecture to Harvard students next Tuesday evening on the \"New Poetry.\"I wish to take this opportunity of expressing the personal satisfaction and pleasure not to say inspiration which your poetry have been to me during the last three years. I sent you some time ago a little article on your poetry which I published in the Harvard Monthly. I trust you received it safely. I have to apologize for a slight inaccuracy which crept into my article. It may not be uninteresting to you to know that I am making a special study of your poetry under the guidance of one of the English instructors here.With thanks for the brave strong words you have spoken and assurances of a deep personal interest in you and your workI remainMost truly yoursCharles T. Sempers.46 Mt. Auburn St.Cambridge Mass.,March 3, 1888Dear SirThe Signet Society of Harvard College has authorized me to extend to you an invitation to make an address under its auspices in Sanders Theatre.Awaiting your reply I remain,Very truly yours,Charles T.
