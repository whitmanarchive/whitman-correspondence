    "text": "CamdenSaturday forenoonJan: 5 '89Fair yesterday—a little dull & tedious cribb'd up here so long, but got along—quite decided bowel action in the forenoon, & a good thorough hot-water bath (tub) in the afternoon—my diet continues the same, mutton broth (plenty of rice in it,) dry toast, and a cup of milk (or two, during the day) with some ice cream (wh' tastes good & welcome) ab't 1½ p m—I fancy I am growing very, very slowly to have more strength—but sit here pretty much the same—(I thoroughly believe in your diagnosis in letter of 24th)—This morning comes the Boston Herald of Jan: 3d with a splendid, nearly two-column criticism & setting forth of the big book, from Sylvester Baxter—wh' I think even you will applaud & be satisfied with—I will send the paper, but first wish to know if you have rec'd one from S B himself—(as I find I send sometimes what you have before)—To-day opens dark & wet & lowering enough—no severe cold yet—I still have signs of my \"cold in the head\" (not violent) yet—a letter from Kennedy—affectionate & devoted—sit here in the big chair three quarters idling—no emphasized physical uncomfortableness—Sunday Jan 6Lowering weather continued. A nice 20 minutes' call from Johnston & Dick Hinton—also f'm Tom Harned—am ab't the same—comfortable enough—as I sit Ed is making up the bed—& I am just going out to the wash-room—got in a cord of cut oak wood yesterday (ready therefore for a cold spell)—bowel action—Horace has just call'd—good luck to the meter—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 5–6 January 1889"
