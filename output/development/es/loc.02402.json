    "text": "Meltonsville Alabama,Sunday, September 16 1877.Walt Whitman—Now, the \"situation\" is as follows. I had by far or larger wheat crop than before—a little of good oats—the little cotton, on (most of it) than I usually plant, proving tolerably well—\"rust\" beginning now (rust ate). On all poor lands about me, cotton started off very slowly, but since the end of an unprecedented drouthdrought lasting through May, the \"season\" been, right about me, absolute perfection and the cotton couldn't help climbing and climbing till it has got to a pretty respectable size. Then as to my corn, planted on very much \"spotted\" ground, upon taking a \"first-day loaf\" with a neighbor, a week ago, I felt bound to say this corn with nearly every stalk bearing either a big ear or a good-sized \"nubbin\" speaks volumes for the season—Maybe it would have done you good to be there and hear how the Philosopher can \"swagger\" and descant and crow on fitting occasions. (However, it may be you are destined as mode of punishments for your \"sins\", never to enjoy \"true Free Will\" by getting to enjoy and be with the P—rather than take second choice and suffer banishment in outer darkness.) The land being mostly poor, I am surprised at the crop—I never have made a crop with so little of plowing after planting. Indeed for 3 years past have helped as to make cultivation easy, I have had fine to practise only sin of resting too much.I think I had better stop my off the you some facts of my spiritual or \"religious\" experience. Then— thou this, I not \"taken in hand\" and \"indoctrinated\" with ideas about \"God\" &c. so early as most children. I remember well, I was beginning to walk two miles to school before the first person (the schoolmaster) put into my head the thought that the \"world\" was either made or needed to be made. I had accepted naturally, \"normally\", the self-existence and eternity of things. Of course, old people got me to accepting their \"tales\", but I never have been \"orthodox\"—have never after the common fashion said \"maker\" or \"master\" or \"Creator\" or \"blessed Savior\" or \"Savior\" or \"the savior\" or \"holy Sabbath\" &c &c &c I never felt that I had sinned against God, nor was \"sorry\".☞ They scared me tho', and made me think \"God\" would rather do so than not—to \"play the Devil with\" me. At 20 years of age, impressed by their falsehoods about experimental religion; in a time when there was no \"revival\", nor excitement, urgency, or favor or shield of nights darknes[darkness], the Philosopher walked up before a crowd, solitarily, and with a brave and yet reverential calmness, and joined the Methodist church \"as a Seeker\". I think I may say I challenged (with sufficient humbleness or modesty) God, Christ, and the Saints to ☞ fight a fair fight.The result was that whereas I had been a little \"blind\", I soon began to \"see\" a good deal more than I had been seeing. Palpably, the saints thought we can't do much at \"casting out\" the sort of calm, critical, healthy, philosophical \"Devils\". What a fall was there my countrymen!—The subject has been a life-time study with me, and I would have you know that at about 39 years I \"got off the fence\" on the Robert Ingersoll side of the question. (I dont admire him boundlessly—his fancy and his tongue seem to run away with him.)My personal experience in childhood, then, enables me to \"see through\" the claim that religious ideas are \"innate\"—they are not. ☞ If the population of the world were divided into lots of ten thousand—separated—minds a blank on the subject—and one person in each lot should think and say \"perhaps the world\" was \"created\", the others would be able to hear in time and accept the fact that perhaps &c &cIntelligence impressed into a gnat or and things dimly seen through smoke or a fog could suggest immaterial spiritual identities. add . Let us dismiss spiritualism and immortality ) Right is that every being should enjoy all that it can enjoy without injury to others.Practical Right is Conduct which permits or promotes enjoyment of Right.Clashing or differing must be compromized[compromised] by electing good without regard to numbers—stick a pin here.The Perfect Judge is the , farthest-seeing man or woman or child (as Ingersoll says children should never be whipped—suggestign[suggesting] that may be found there.)Conscience is ideas of Causes and Results.Ideas of Safety and Interest govern the baser conscienceSatisfaction to the glorious sentiment of Love or Good-will \"world without end\" moves the man whom I love.In addition, I praise Pride, Courage, and Good Sense child of Free (and plentiful) Thought—Leaves of Grass does the same. Does W.W. wish to say \"in all orthodox people behold! a secret silent loathing and despair? It looks like it ought to be they have good sense!!!— A man who is trying to be a Kosmos ought to wish to correspond (interchange) in long letters with one who certainly is a Philosopher—especially where cruel circumstances make the latter's life monotonous. Proud, and independent, but not too much because well-willed and if not W—P.S. Let others finish specimens. Nothing but July 2, June, March John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 16 September 1877"
