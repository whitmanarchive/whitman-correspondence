    "text": "London, Ont.,20 July 1890It is more than a week since I heard last from you—I hope you are keeping well. I have got a big blank book properly ruled and with printed headings for each page, all planned with great pains for a Walt Whitman Bibliography. Commenced working at it today—it will take months to complete it (working at it odd times)—I am entering in it in proper place and order all writing by or about a certain Walt Whitman. I find that what I am shortest in is first editions of poems and prose pieces by the said W.W.—I mean as there came out in newspapers and magazines—if you have any of these (especially early ones)that you do not especially want to keep I wish you would let me have them. I expect the new inspector (Mr Christie) up here tomorrow or next day. He will likely remain a couple of days.Mrs Bucke went to Sarnia yesterday for a short visit. We are all well. Are having perfect weather—neither hot nor cold—just right.How does the O'Connor \"Preface\" get on? I fear it is too hot down your way to do much—had a note from Mrs O'C. a few days ago—she seemed to be feeling the heat very much.No Willy Gurd here yet. I hope (but scarcely dare expect) to see him this week.Been dipping into Ruskin lately—like him better than I ever did before—but he is too hard to please—ordinary modern folk are not to his taste—too bad!Love to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 July 1890"
