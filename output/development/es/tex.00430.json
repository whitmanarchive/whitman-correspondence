    "text": "16 May 1873CamdenFriday 10 amDear Brother WaltMother has just received your letter and I thought I would answer it for her as she wanted me too. (Yesterday she had not a very good day, but to day she is better, and she does not want you to weary about her nor to come on until you fell it will be no injury to you. The doctor ordered her some new medicine yesterday, which I hope will do her good. She had some appetite, does not relish her food much though. George got some good whisky, and she takes that occasionally, when she feels badly, and it does her good. She is sitting up, sewing a little. yours LouLove to you Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman to Walt Whitman, [16 May 1873]"
