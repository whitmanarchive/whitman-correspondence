    "text": "see notes Sept 22 1888WINSTEAD, TEMPLE ROAD.Rathmines, Dublin.November 21. 1882.Dear Mr. Whitman,Your card & \"Progress\" have just arrived. I rejoice that with the ill tidings of your recent prostration comes good news of your recovery. May this better condition continue! You annex your friends so closely, that your health & strength becomes part of theirsâ€”I send you the Academy with my notice of Specimen Days. I closed my review with a wish that you might try a voyage across the Atlantic. It would be a happy thing if we could have you here for a while, where you would find a bedroom, books, &, in summer, flowers & birds, beside a friend or two. Think of this. In London, I am sure, your welcome would be hearty.Please notice a few lines by the editor of the Academy (I suppose) on p. 362. Who his informant was I do not know.Most truly yours, dear friend,Edward Dowden. Edward Dowden to Walt Whitman, 21 November 1882"
