    "text": "40 Grosvenor Road,Westminster Embankment,S.W.February 3. 1890.Dear Mr. Whitman—On coming up from a Saturday 15 Monday visit to Logan at Oxford, I have found the delightful surprise of a letter from thee dated January 22nd The enclosures, too, I have much enjoyed, & I am sending one of the proofs to Logan, with thy letter to read & return. We were talking a great dealabout thee yesterday. There are a great many of the \"coming men\" there who are deeply influenced by \"Leaves of Grass\" & who find in the curious English mingling of tradition & freedom, history & change, the most appropriate setting to thy lines of Thought. Probably it is only the stress of urgent national crises, such as a war, or of equally urgent national reforms, of which there are many nowtalked about here, that make the masses of men really think freely & generously & act unselfishly—As thee says—\"all goes in well in the United States\"—and though one cannot wish for any lack of prosperity, seeing what miseries it entails upon the poor & defenceless, yet one realizes that it is not, as yet, the best condition for the appreciation of higher things. From another point of view,in which perhpas thee will not agree with me, I think the \"Saints\" were quite right in attempting to free the spirit by torturing the body!Our chief political interest now is in watching, & assisting as far as we can, the spread of \"Socialism\"—It seems to be permeating everything. I cannot now imagine what life would be like with no interest in politics! And yet I used to be very happy in Germantown!We had a more interesting visit to Logan. He is very busy, outside his College work, with a \"Social Science Club\", also with an attempt to reduce the excessive expenses of Oxford, which make it impossible for any poor men to get educated there. As rich people have evidently no monopoly of brains, it is a great pity that all this splendid training is accessible only to them. Some day a Royal Commission or something like will thoroughlyexpose the manifold inequities of that most delightful of all Universities—& perhaps things will be changed then—We spent all our Sunday discussing the desirable reforms of Oxford, but in spite of that we shall go again to visit it, even in its unregeneate state, as soon as we possibly can. Rukh-mabai, my Indian friend was with us—her first visit to Oxford, and she was tremendously interested in it.I am sitting in the nursery to write, and the exigencies of thesituation make it very difficult to pursue a connected train of thought. Ray is ramping about with a huge stuffed monkey of belligerent tendencies, who beats us all unmercifully when Ray brandishes him in her arms. Karin is babbling on the floor, playing with blocks, & both nurses are adding a not insignificant share to the general babel. Outside there is a peculiarly disagreeable fog—next door similar sounds from the nursery can be faintly heard through the walls, & Igrow appalled to think of the awful volume of sound that daily arises from all the nurseries in London!This is a most unsatisfactory letter—but I feel as if the fog had got into my head. We are to have here tonight a meeting of the Westminster Women's Liberal Association. I am to take the chair, but I haven't yet thought of the necessary speech. I must begin now—so I will close this letter as I began it, with many many thanks for thy kind and most interesting letter.Mary Whitall Costelloe Mary Smith Costelloe to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1890"
