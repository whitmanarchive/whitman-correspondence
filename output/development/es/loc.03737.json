    "text": "Paris10, Rue Croyon6 Janvier 1889Dear Mr. Whitman,I send you the estimate of you I had room to publish last year in one of our most important Reviews, La Nouvelle Revue. Unfortunately the essay is not complete; I was obliged to shorten it, as it is often the case, when one writes for periodicals, and I would not myself encroach on the space devoted to the work of other contributors; but my second series of English and American poets will soon appear in book form, and there will I print all I wrote first about you, to the full extent.Did you hear a lady friend of mine, Madame Blanc-Bentzon reviewed \"Leaves of Grass\" in the Revue des Deux — Mondes? She did it ten or fifteen years ago, I don't remember exactly the date, and the same book was also reviewed four years ago by Madame Léo Quesnel, in the Revue Politique et Litteràire. Lately, a young writer, M. Francis Vielé–Griffin translated Faces in a less known periodical, La Revue indépendante; and I have been told another young poet, who died five years ago, M. Jules Laforgue, translated, I know not where, A Woman Waits for me. I cannot procure easily the essays or translations; but for that, I should have forwarded them to you.Believe me, Dear Mr. Whitman, your admirerGabriel SarrazinParis,10, Rue Croyon Gabriel Sarrazin to Walt Whitman, 6 January 1889"
