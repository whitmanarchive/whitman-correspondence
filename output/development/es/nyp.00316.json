    "text": "Monday afternoon March 17—Well, mother dear, I feel quite well to-day considering—in good spirits, & free from any pain—I suppose you got my letter Saturday last— The doctor has been here to-day, first time in three days— (so you see he don't think me a very critical case.) We have had real March weather here for two or three days, strong & sudden winds, & dust— but it is pleasanter to-day—it is now about ½ past 1—I have had my lunch & Mrs. O'Connor has come in for a few moments— I have a little piece in the N. Y. Graphic of Saturday afternoon, March 17—it is a daily afternoon paper—I write for it, so far—they pay moderately. Mother, I feel to-day as if I was getting well—(but my leg is so clumsy yet— & my head has to avoid much talking or being talked to)—I hope this will find you all right, dearest mother—I think about you much— Walt.Mrs. O'Connor wishes me to give her love to you. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 17 March [1873]"
