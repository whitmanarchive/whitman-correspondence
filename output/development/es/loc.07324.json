    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,6 Nov 1889Your letter of 4th enclosing Mrs Costelloe's to hand this afternoon—both letters entirely welcome. I am exceedingly sorry for Mrs Costelloe but the fact is the life she went in for (an attempt to carry all London on her back) was simply suicidal. Should she fully recover from this breakdown (as I trust and think she will) she will no doubt be wiser and do better in future. Have just been up at the patient's dance for half an hour—some 400 people in the hall having quite a time—we have a new hall this year nearly twice as big as the old one and only up one stair which is quite an improvement on the old hall (where you were at chapel once) up three flights. Letter from Willy Gurd today—nothing in it—does not say a word as to when he will be through and return here. But I guess it is all right and that he will be here soon. Yes, I fear you are dull enough mais, courage mon Ami! Never say die! When the meter turns into money (which may be sooner than we think) I am going to see if I can't do something to cheer you up a little—in the meantime it is grand to see you keep up as well as you do—and actually gaining if any thing as the months pass—we might have some good quiet times together yet if the Lord pleases—and if not? well, we will say \"all right any how\"R M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 6 November 1889"
