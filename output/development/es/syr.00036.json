    "text": "[London, Ont.,]22 Jan [188]9Well that wonderfull snowstorn did not amount to much after all, made very indifferent sleighing and today the sun is out bright and warm and the snow is going again as fast as it can. [—] Your good, heartily welcomed letter of 19th & 20th came to hand this forenoon, by the same mail came also your bundle of \"Critic\" and \"Press\" also a bundle from Horace; San Francisco \"Bulletin\" & \"Poet Lore [.]\" Many thanks to you and him for all. Also just arrived from Brentano Bros \"The Century Guild Hobby Horse\" with a lovely little 2 page piece on \"November Boughs\" by Selwyn Image. So you see 'tout va bien\" with my collection which bids fair to be one day the envy of millionaires. The \"Springfield Rep.\", I should say, came in Horaces bundle and I like Sanborns criticism well—better than the critic piece which (to me) has a smack of unrealness, want of sincerity (but perhaps I do the writer injustice). [—] Yes, dear Walt, you must be tired, horribly tired, of that room of yours—I really think that when the warm spring days come you must move downstairs and by means of some contrivance get into a suitable carriage and have a look again at the grass and trees—if you are not worse than at present if can be done and ought to be done, and if any thing will revive you that will.—Yes I shall be right glad to see the big book in its permanent cover and shall depend on you for as early a copy as possible. Nothing more definite about trip East, still hope to get off 4 FebLove to you R M BuckeP.S. Thanks also for Ed. Carpenter's letter I was real glad to see itR M B.
