    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,27 March 1890I have yours of 23d (posted 24th) it came to hand last evening, it and also mrs Costelloe's (accompanying it) were heartily welcome. Am glad that you seem to be no worse—but what is this about Harry Stafford? I fear from what you say he is in a bad way, but what is it? It has been a terrible winter all about here for sickness and deaths and I guess it is no better your way from what you say—I want to know if there is any prospect of you giving a lecture on or about 15 April—if there is I shall try to be on hand. If I go I shall probably spend a day or two in Phila', then a day or two in Baltimore, a day or two in Washington and a few days at the seaside (Atlantic City perhaps) justto get a little change and a mouthful of fresh sea air. Did I tell you that we have arranged for the money to get tools to make the meter? I think Gurd will go east for the tools about 2d April and will be back here with them (I hope) early in June—so far all looks well for the meter and if it actually turns out according to appearance at present I may be a better off man after this year in which case I hope to see more of you and (if that is possible) do more for you. Mrs Bucke and little Pardee are still in Sarnia, they are having a good time and it is doing them good I guess—All quiet here, plenty of work, but as long as we can do it we must not grumble at that—still, if I had my own way I would have a little less work and a little more restI hope to see you before very long and am, with love, your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 March 1890"
