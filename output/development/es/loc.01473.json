    "text": "Sheldon House Ocean Grove N.J.New JerseySept 21stDear Walt:I am down here for a week or two, under the direction of my Dr, taking hot sea baths. Came here last Monday, a pleasant place with plenty of sea & sea air. I feel well & walk some days 8 or 10 miles, but there are certain symptoms that the Dr thinks hot baths will remove. Now mainly what I write for is this, to ask you to come up & be my guest for a week. I cantcan't come to you very well, but cantcan't you come to me? This is a large comfortable House with few guests, near the beach & you would feel at home here. CantCan't you come? Come to-morrow (Saturday) & send me a dispatch what train. We can have the Atlantic Ocean all to ourselves, & maybe these hot sea baths at the hotel are the thing for you. Do come.With loveJ Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 21 September [1883]"
