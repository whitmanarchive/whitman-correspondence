How is 'Sula? how the baby? Tell me, when you write, about Smith—give him my love—I still keep well & bustling for me—have been down in the country much of the fall, but am now here probably for the winter—Wish I was with you & 'Sula for a few weeks—often think about you all—Got a letter from London from Trübner day before yesterday for six sets of my books, remitting the (wholesale) price—I sell a set now & then—The Gilchrists (Mrs G. and Herbert & Grace) are at 177 Remsen street Brooklyn—Jeannette Gilder has written to me that she is going to write my life & asking for items &c—I rec'dreceived the Scribner for Nov: I suppose from you—Three days storm & gale here, but beautiful & clear to-night—I am going out for an hour—Walt Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 12 December [1878]"
