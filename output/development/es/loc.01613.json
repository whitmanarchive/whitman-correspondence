    "text": "ELLIS & GREENF. S. ELLIS,Bookseller,33 KING STREET, COVENT GARDEN,LONDON, W.C.Aug 23, 1871To Walt Whitman Esq,Dear Sir:I thank you very much for your letter received this morning. Its frank and pleasant tone makes me regret even more than I should otherwise have done, to feel myself obliged to say at once that I do not see my way to bringing out a complete edition of your poems in England. I admire them so very much myself that I should much like to do it but there are certain pieces (among those which I admire the most) which would not go down in England, and it certainly would not be worth while to publish it again in a mutilated form, nor of course would you wish it. W. M. Rossetti is a great admirer of your poems and a man by no means squeamish yet you see he did not venture to publish them without alteration in England. I think he was wrong: they should have been published complete & with your sanction or let alone. May I keep the volume you send me? if so I will remit you the price for I have tried in vain to get a complete edition through Tr√ºbners.I am Dear SirYours faithfullyF. S. Ellis F. S. Ellis to Walt Whitman, 23 August 1871"
