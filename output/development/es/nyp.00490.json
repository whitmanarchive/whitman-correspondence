    "text": "CamdenJune 13 '83 Evn'gEveningMy dear friendThe corrections you specified have been or will be made, for future printing—(I wish you would notify me of any others you see also)—The book is to be published simultaneously here and in London Eng.England on the 15th June. Typographically, & in get up, binding &c. the experts all pronounce it a success—it is generally taken for an imported book, (if that is any compliment)—the wonder is not that there are a few errors & plate-breakages—but that there are so few—your part looks & is even better than I anticipated from the proofs—more tremendous—the 1883 Letter is vitalest of all—it is like the Old French Revolution of '93—long, long its provocation & reason-why—stands there, something, the only—an immense prologue before it & an immense epilogue after, & it but a speck in the middle between—an exception—but enough, the mark, the inerasable warning, for a thousand years—The printed notice enclosed is from a scholar & staunch friend—a Yankee litterateur—W. S. K.—if you feel to do so, I wish you would write him a few words—he is worthy—Say that I sent you the criticism—his address is Wm Sloane KennedyCambridge Mass:I am well. Did you see the Critic June 9? I saw the Tribune notice.W. W. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 13 June 1883"
