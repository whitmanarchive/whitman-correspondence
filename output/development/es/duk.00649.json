    "text": "WashingtonOct. 13Dear Sir:I write to ask your kind offices in the following described matter:I sent to Doolady six weeks ago an orderMr. James Gray, Bookbinder 16 Spruce st. 4th floor, is the custodian of the sheets of my Leaves of Grass, & has been the binder for me. The sheets are now at his place.I hear that he has become involved—in fact has failed. If so, I regret it much. I have been waiting now over six weeks for the fulfilment of orders I have sent him for bound books—& now, under that state of things, I suppose it will not be possible for him to do the work. Walt Whitman to Dionysius Thomas, 13 October [1867]"
