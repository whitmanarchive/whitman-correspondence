I am glad to hear that the celluloid negative reached you safely. I am copyrighting the photo: in England in your interestThank you for your kind promise to send me copies of the N. E. Mag. + the Phila. Mag. containing article to the arrival of which I shall look forward with pleasure.As I know that J. W.

I am writing this in a patient's house where pen + ink are not available, while waiting the advent of a tardy \"little stranger\" as I do not wish to miss the mail tonight.I hope this will find you in improved health + \"with jocund heart still beating in your breast.\"I cannot write more at present.Again thanking you for yr kindness + with best love to youremainyours affectionatelyJ JohnstonP.S.
