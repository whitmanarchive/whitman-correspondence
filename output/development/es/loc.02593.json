    "text": "High St. GermantownDec. 30. 1888.Dear Mr. Whitman,I trust the spirit may not be deemed intrusive which urges me to write & wish you a happy New Year, & to thank you at the same time for the happiness which I have had in reading \"November Boughs.\" Christmas brought me a copy, the result of a special petition to Santa Claus, & now I can look back through all the wisdom and beauty of its pages, & forward to a long intimacy with them, such as one has with one's own few books. I am so glad you wrote that \"backward glance.\" It will be precious to all lovers of your poetry, & stand as the truest & most upright answer to its critics. Perhaps you do not know how great a pleasure it is to those who love poetry to see their poets again—Burns, Shakespeare, & the rest—with a poet. It is like going through a gallery of paintings with an artist.And your notes on Elias Hicks, a figure whom I might never have met elsewhere, were full of interest to me. It is very true that note on \"The United States Today,\" & so far as decline of spirituality is implied in that of definite beliefs, it is deeply to be regretted, and yet, amid such varied elements, one may say—is perhaps even more bound to say than in other parts of the world—\"I will not accept a part for the whole, join one group of my fellow beings & cut myself off from the rest.\" The strongest spirituality has been shown here in individualities, in going direct to the heart of things, & that is what you are helping us to know & to feel.We have not heard any news of you for a long time, but hope earnestly that your health is better. My father joins me in heartfelt regards—Very sincerely yoursSophia Kirk. Sophia Kirk to Walt Whitman, 30 December 1888"
