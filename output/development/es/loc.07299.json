    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,10 May 1889Although you did not enclose Mrs O'C's card with yours of 8th (you have probably seen the card lying about since you sent the letter) yet I judge from the tenor of what you say that your O'C. is very sick. You will feel bad about it I know and it is very natural you should still it is my decided conviction that we shall be all better off went[when] we get out of our present state than we are at present. And though I would gladly see O'Connor well yet (that being out of the question, I fear) the next best thing I think will be for him to leave us. Poor fellow! it will only be a very little while untill we rejoin him and we will settle then whether the whole thing was or was not well planned! I am glad to hear that they are looking up a chair for you. If (having a chair) you were living in a cottage with a lawn, trees &c &c. and living on the ground floor (as might all be arranged well enough) there is no reason why you should not spend a good part of your time during the summer in your chair on the grass, under the trees, among the flowers. You are not tied to one house (and that about the worst house and the worst situated that could be found for you) and there is no reason at all why you should not go where you would have the surroundings you need. Why not get Horace to look about for a good cottage for you? I hope to see you before a very great whileLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 10 May 1889"
