    "text": "Dec. 29, 1890My Dear Friend,Thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas was spent has tempted me to write a few lines to you to-night. We all spent that day very happily with , New Years day we expect them to spend with us. How nice it would be if you could join us. I don't know whether any of the folks at home will be able to come over or not. Van or Ed may come but Pap does not go out a great deal since his illness. He does not improve as rapidly as we would like to have him. was pretty well for her when we were home last.We are all well excepting the baby who has quite a sever cold at present.We do not expect to remain here another year. Harry has made application to the R. R. Co, but has not received much encouragement yet. I suppose you have heard of Mont's removal to Elwood N. J. He is quite well pleased with his new home.Please accept my thanks for the $2 which you sent the children.I hope this letter will find you in good health and spirits. With best wishes and love from us all I say good night.Your loving friendEva M. Stafford Eva Stafford to Walt Whitman, 29 December 1890"
