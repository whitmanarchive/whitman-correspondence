I want you both to continue. I am not much different in my health—no worse. All the rest here are well. This little cut picture was one I intended to send last Christmas, but it got lost in my papers—so I enclose it now, for fun—Best love to you, dear child, & to my dear Hattie too, fromUncle Walt—I will write to Hattie soon— Walt Whitman to Jessie Louisa Whitman, 23 April 1874"
