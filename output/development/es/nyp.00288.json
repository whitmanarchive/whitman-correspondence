    "text": "Providence, R. I.October 19, 1868.Dear Nelly,I will just write you a line or two, anyhow. I am stopping the last three days here with Doctor and Jeannie & having a very pleasant time indeed—only Jeannie has had something of a bad spell—but is quite bright & comfortable this morning, & presided at breakfast. William is here—which adds much indeed to the pleasure of my visit—William has not recovered from an annoying cold, yet does pretty well—I have seen Mrs. Whitman, & like her—have seen her & talked &c. three times—have seen Miss Nora Perry—am going this afternoon to Thomas Davis's to stay two or three days, & then return to New York—whence in two or three days more, to Washington.Mother is quite well for an old woman of 74—speaks of you—is now in her new quarters—much roomier & pleasanter. Sister Martha & her two little girls have come on from St. Louis, and are now living with mother. George & Eddy are well. Mrs. Price & her girls are well & in good spirits—I am enjoying my vacation agreeably, but moderately—as becomes a gentleman of my size & age.Give my love to Mr. and Mrs. Ashton—also to Charley—also to dear little Jeannie—It will not be long, Nelly, before I shall be with you all again. Best love to you, dearest friend.Walt.My last letter to William was also to you—though I suppose you did not see it yet. Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 19 October 1868"
