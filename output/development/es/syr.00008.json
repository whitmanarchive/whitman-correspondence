    "text": "BRISBANE, Rsee notes March 3d 188983 Bould St MichelParisFeb 1st 1887Dear Walt Whitman.Your two postals came duly to hand—the last on the 2d of last month—but the letter there in announced has not come. It is now too late I presume to expect it:I will say for Mr Laforgue that he is glad of your permission to translate \"Leaves of Grass\" & that he expects to make of it an interesting VolumeWe want to publish it with a preface in the shape of a biographical sketch. It would be pleasant to have facts in your life not yet published: your youth, how you gave yourself on the battlefield during the war, etc. Would you have the strength & the inclination to furnish us such?I am sorry to learn thro' the papers that you are permanently disabled physically. I trust that the appearance of your poems in a foreign dress will have a happy pecuniary result. In any event you have too many friends on both sides the ocean ever to be forgotten.As the interpreter of the little group here I am the bearer of many good wordsEver yours sincerelyR. Brisbane R. Brisbane to Walt Whitman, 1 February 1887"
