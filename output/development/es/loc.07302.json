    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,15 May 1889I returned from Toronto (after attending, yesterday, Mrs O'Reilly's funeral) at noon today and find your long and interesting letter of Saturday and Sunday enclosing Mrs. O'Connor's most pathetic letter, to you, of 9th. Poor Mrs O'Connor is indeed alone, I fear the rest of her life will be terribly lonely. I am much pleased that you have actually been out in the chair and that you seemed to find it a success—I shall feel easier about you—you will not be so horribly dull now though you may still be dull enough. But to get out even a little while once or twice a day (in good weather) will undoubtedly break the monotony a little. It will be good for Ed, too, will give him something to do—some little exercise. I am glad to hear that you sweat freely now that the warm weather has come. It is a capital thing for you and frequent baths with more or less massage each day will keep the skin acting and will be most beneficial to you. Do not be discouraged because you do not see good effects from such things (as baths, massage, getting out &c &c) at once—at your age reaction takes place slowly—but all these things will tell in the long run and I have good hopes that you may make a rally yet for you have a constitution of ten thousand. The letter containing the 1st prescription must have miscarried (I certainly sent it). I do not think very much of the dinner scheme but all the same I should like to be there (have heard nothing abt. it except your letter).If there were some good speeches well reported it might not be amiss (I am a firm believer in all legitimate forms of advertizing). I should like to be there and make a speech myself all right enoughLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 15 May 1889"
