    "text": "Feb.[February] 2, 1872Dear Mr. Rudolf Schmidt:Your note of Jan.January 5, acknowledging receipt of \"papers,\" & enclosing to me your photograph, is just received. I like your photograph & thank you for it—& I like indeed the good frank way of sending such pictures, where interested & curious. I wish to know whether you have safely received the particular copy of the last edition of my poems, in One Vol., with some sheet photos. enclosed, which I sent you by Mr. Clausen. Mr. C. tells me that he put up the various matter I furnished in three parcels—if you have got the three it is all right.I mailed you a letter of some length, Jan.January 16. I shall send you, probably by next mail, my latest piece, in a western magazine for February. Also a second copy of my pamphlet \"Democratic Vistas\"—If the first copy reached you, send the second to Mr. Bjornson—if not, not. Yes, I am sure I should like your friend Bjornson much.I am going next week to New York to stay there till April 10—my address there will be 107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U. S. America—about April 10, I shall return here again, & my address will be—I am writing this at my desk—as above, Treasury Building, middle of afternoon—From my great south window I can see a far-stretching & noble view, many, many miles of open ground, the Potomac river, the hilly banks, the mountains of Virginia &c. We are having a severe cold spell. Every thing is white with snow, but the sun has been clear & dazzling all day—The hour of office-closing is nigh. And I too must close. I have much pleasure in writing to you, & expecting yours. Adieu. Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 2 February 1872"
