Transcript of yr Critic article from Critic's proof to day (Frid eve). 'Tis strong + tonicky.Tiredly, (7 P. M) Aug 15. '90W S K.Sat Morn,I shd have said that I read the proof of the last 1/3 of yr piece. I have 2 assistants in same room reading proof—at least half of the time.K.They don't know much though, + their mistakes mortify me considerably. One of 'em was going to leave yr foot-note in the text, as it stood! William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 15 August 1890"
