    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Friday noon, July 17, 1868. Dearest mother,I have nothing particular to write about, but I thought I would just write a line. I hope you have stood the hot weather, without giving out—& George too I hope he exercises more care about himself, because I think our family is more liable than many to the effects of the great heat & exposure to the sun—I have got along pretty well, but it has been awful hot—& continues so, though as I write here by my window, there has quite a cool breeze sprung up since I commenced writing—Fortunately, I sleep very well nights—there has been only one night I haven't slept comfortably—We have a new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts, as I suppose you have seen by the papers—He hasn't made his appearance here yet—but is expected soon—I only hope he will be as agreeable for a boss as the others have been—but somehow I don't believe he will—I am really sorry to have Binckley go, for he was a good friend of mine—& Mr. Browning too—Mother, I do hope you will get through this awful spell, all right—it can't last much longer—& George too—Mother, don't look for the next letter till Wednesday next—I have had a letter from Jeff—all are well & hearty, except Mat has some cough yet—take care of yourself, dear mother.Walt.Your letter has come to-day, mother—John Burroughs has returned—he has a good piece in Putnam's for August— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 17 July 1868"
