('Twas I who introduced your works to Ruskin.)I have for many years, I have harkened for a letter from you. Can you write me three or four lines? (It is not for the mere autograph I seek.)My friend Carpenter—one of your best friends—has sent me a copy of his \"Songs of Lahore\"; containing two pieces from you works. I suppose you have got a copy.The verses I enclose were written by a journeyman boiler-maker, in 1871.Wm Harrison Riley.P.S. I cannot express my feelings in this Commericial language, when writing to kapla I love, and do not try. William Harrison Riley to Walt Whitman, 13 May 1888"
