    "text": "London,Ontario,Canada.20. Sep 1891 My dear Walt Whitman, Another perfect day. I write this in Dr's office @ 4.30pm.—The windows—wide open—admit a gentle pleasant breeze. Outside, the sky perfectly clear & cloudless, the fountain playing, the trees across the open space, along the avenue & in the distance with shades & various colours&very beautiful in the sunshine. Dr Beemer just entering his buggy as I write, & driving off. It seems to me as though I had entered an \"Earthly Paradise.\"—Day after day of unsurpassed beauty—nights of wonderful moonlight radiance, doubly beautiful amid the trees & on the lawns & flowers of this beautiful place—the soothing rest & peace & the hospitable kindness of all the people here—all combine to make it very sweet & pleasant to me. Indeed, I tell the Dr. that unless I leave soon I shall find it difficult to tear myself away! I have no special news since my last letter. We drove into town yesterday afternoon—everything of interest to me, the shops, the vehicles, the people, the streets, buildings pavements, fields, everything—and everything looking its best in the glorious sunshine.—Evening spent in the house—chiefly in learning & playing \"Pedro\" with Willie & his friends. To chapel this morning, & afterwards to church! (Rev'd Mr Richardson's.) Thoughts & feelings of a very mixed character! Dr. writing letters &c. He seems to me to look a good deal better since he came home,—has a better colour & looks fresher. A long pause here—discussing future arrangements as to my trip with Dr. Decided nothing, however, for the present. I hope that we shall hear that you have been able to take a drive again this lovely weather. Dr. says he is \"going to quit whether school keeps or not.\" So I will quit too. With love to you always & best wishes Yours affectionately J.W. Wallace James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 20 September 1891"
