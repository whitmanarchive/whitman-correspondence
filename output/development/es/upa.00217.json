    "text": "England, HampsteadJune 18./82Dearest friend,I like with all my heart (& head too) \"A memorandum at a venture\". It is as clear as daylight to me that you speak truth—invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope & promise & impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in this truth since it burst upon me a veritable sunrise in reading your poems in 1869—each part of those poems necessary to the whole—It would indeed be betraying a great cause a sacred trust to cancel what is now once more attacked.I cannot think the smallest harm of any kind, even pecuniary, (except to the men themselves who thus expose the nature of their thoughts)—will come of it. I do not think you will sell one less copy, & I suppose you will have a larger share of the profits. I am very glad you have written these clear strong words for the North American.A real pleasure it is to see John Burroughs—both for your sake—for it seems in a kind of way almost like seeing you—& for his own. What eyes he has for the ways of the whole dumb world. He has gone just now to my favorite Haslemere, in quest of nightingales—& I hope will make the acquaintance of an excellent friend of mine there to whom I gave an introduction Unluckily Herby is away—painting some portraits in Monmouthshire with which he has succeeded well. He has also sold his Academy picture—& will be back in time to see John Burroughs on his way thro'through . Ah if you had but come with him! Best love from Giddy & I.Goodbye dearest friendAnne GilchristFriendliest remembrance to your brother & sister & nieces. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 18 June 1882"
