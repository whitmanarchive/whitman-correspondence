    "text": "Camden NJ8.15.858 PMDear Walt, I send you a fish caught at \"Anglesea\" at 2 PM today by Harned & myself. We have just arrived home after a good time, although I got knocked off the boat—struck over the head with the \"boom\"—and knocked over into twelve feet water—whence I had to swim ashore—of course it all ended well—and all's well that ends well although I got an awful blow between the eye. I go early in the morning (Sunday) to see Mary—my wife at Atlantic—but Monday will see you at 7. Expect to be home a good deal next week—Tom sends Love. Regards to Mrs DavisTenderlyJM Scovel PS One of the \"Press\" Men came up with us and told me at the train that the Syndicate article wdwould be in Sunday's Press. Ordered the Tribunes for you —JMS James Scovel to Walt Whitman, 15 August 1885"
