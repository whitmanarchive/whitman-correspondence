    "text": "Thursday night 8 o'clockDearest mother,It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good wood fire in the stove—have been alone all the evening—I sit up as much as I can, especially evenings—as I sleep better afterwards—I rec'd a letter from Jeff to–day, Matty was as well as at last accounts—about the same—no worse—I also rec'd a letter from Heyde—he said Han was well as usual—I have been sitting up nearly all day—& have less distress in the head than I have had—which is a great gain—I had a letter from Mrs. Price to–day—she invites me to come & stop awhile there, as soon as I can journey—Mother, it is kind of company to write to you—it is very lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room—about 9 Charles Eldridge comes in & assists me to soak my feet in hot water, & then I turn in—(I have my trowserstrousers on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)—Friday noon Feb. 14 Mother, I am sitting up again to–day—passed a comfortable night, & as soon as it is favorable weather I shall try to get started for outside—first, to get down stairs—& then perhaps across the street—3 o'clock I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest—Mrs. O'Connor has just been to see me—brought a basket of nice things—Mother dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—I send you Harper's & Frank Leslie's—I am having a very fair day to–day—it is moderate & pleasant here, but mostly cloudy—I have been quite occupied writing several letters about business—have set up all day, with the exception of an hour—Love to you, dear mother, Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [13]–14 [February 1873]"
