    "text": "Kirkwood, N.J.New JerseyJune 5th, 187Dear Walt—I have said that I would not write to you any more (until you wrote to me), but I have got some more of my troubles to tell you: there. one But I have some— I would like you to know: it is this, last Monday morning Lucas stoped[stopped] me as I was coming from the pond with a pail of watter[water] (on my way to the Station) and asked me how I would like to come over to his office and help the boys with the books and do the letters myself. I said I like to come and he talked asked me several questions which I answered to suit him and then he asked me to come over during the day and he would talk farther[further] the subject, so when I got there he said that he would give me $50 for one year and board myselfe[myself] in the meantime he went away and left me with the boys, so when I came away they asked me if I would come back that I would see Mr. Lucas at the in the morning and give him my answer was no, of corse[course], I told him that I could not work for any less than my board he did not think I could earn that I guess for he left me and went home. The result was this he refuses to let me practice in his line. What do you think of a rich man rough it. I will explain the mater[matter] more particularly to you when I see you. The folks are all well and all wish to see you very much.Excuse writing for I am in a hurry.Your affectionate son,Harry Stafford Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 5 June 1878"
