    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,25 Nov 1888Your post card of 22d reached me yesterday afternoon. There is nothing new as to my plans since I wrote you last some two or three days ago, have not heard from Wm Gurd since. I expect he will be here before the week is out. That he will soon after he gets here, proceed to Ottawa to attend to the Canadian and European patents—I do not know how long this will take but I hope he will be through there by Xmas time and that quite early in the year he & I will go East to \"float\" the meter in the States. It is a weary, almost an endless, business but there is nothing for it but to keep pegging away. The weather here has made a decided turn for the better within the last week, today is clear, bright, cool and very bracing and delightfull. We are all well and all goes quietly and pleasantly with us. I am not too well pleased at this postponement of my trip East as I am anxious to see you and was counting on it in the immediate future but I hope I shall not fail to get East early in January (at latest) and that you will then be as well or better than now.— Did your little piece come out in the \"Critic\" yesterday? if so I hope you will send me a copyAlways your friendR M BuckeSee notes Nov 30, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 25 November 1888"
