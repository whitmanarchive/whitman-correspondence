    "text": "WashingtonThursday afternoon Nov. 14Dearest mother,I send you Jeff's letter to me, just received. Mat is better, it seems, & has put off journeying to Camden. Jeff says it is doubtful whether she will come at all, unless she can have you go home with her to St. Louis. Mother, just let the thing take its course, & not disturb your mind on the question of going or not going—It will be time enough to decide, when it comes to the point—Mammy dear, I got your letter this morning—glad to hear you are as well as you are, & hope this will find you comfortable—All goes well as usual with me—Love to you, dear mother—& to all—Walt.Mother, just as I was closing this letter, who should come in to see me but Margaret Avery—she has been down to Virginia, and is going through Baltimore & Philadelphia—When in Philadelphia, she will come over to Camden & make you a call—probably within a day or two— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 14 November [1872]"
