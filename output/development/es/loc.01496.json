    "text": "Temple Road,Dublin.Feb. 16. 1876.My dear Mr. Whitman,I received a few days since your last letter. It is very pleasant to me to find you liked my Shakspere[Shakespeare] book, but much more to know that you are not indifferent to me, myself, & do not think of me as a stranger.The report of your health makes us both hopeful & anxious. I do not know whether your American Summers are as health–bringing as our Summers, but I should suppose they have a decided advantage over your winters in this respect (notwithstanding all John Burroughs says of Winter Sunshine) for an invalid; so it is chiefly from the summer that we shall look for an advance towards recoveryThe newspaper statement of the attitude of the American public towards you is a surprise & a disappointmentWe had been misled by a correspondent of The Academy, which is a paper always friendly to you, into quite a different view of things—I am waiting until next Saturday to see whether Rossetti has inserted this statement in the Academy. If he has not, I will write to him & try to get it printed there.Two friends, Professor Atkinson of Trin. Coll.Trinity College Dublin, & Stoker, who writes to you, have asked me to get copies of your Three volumes, L of GLeaves of Grass, Two Rivulets & Memoranda. But I do not doubt that half–a dozen of my friends will wish to have the books, so I should be obliged if you would send a parcel containing six copies of Each book—the Authograph 1876–Edition. Stoker wishes me to ask you to put, if you do not object, his name (Abraham Stoker) & your own in the copies for him&He has told you perhaps of a very lively debate we had at our \"Fortnightly Club\" on \"The genius of Walt Whitman\" last Monday Evening FebFebruary 14 th A most savage, but ill–planned, attack opened the discussion. I followed with a speech which consisted in the main of apt selections from L. of G.Leaves of Grass & Democratic Vistas, & these were felt by my hearers to be a very effective answer to the previous speaker's extravagant statements. Men, to my surprise & great satisfaction, followed speaker after speaker on the Whitman side,—a barrister, a young clergyman, a man in business, & others, while the remaining speakers were three, one who placed you below Victor Hugo on the ground of alleged deficiency of form & beauty in your poems, one who announced that he had never read your books but was sure you could have written nothing as good as Burns' \"Cotter's Saturday Night\", & a third recently introduced to L. of G.Leaves of Grass & who confessed to having discovered some few great poems, but much that baffled him, & that should be challenged.The result was on the whole highly satisfactory. It was the 2nd Evening occupied by you during the present session.These little skirmishes, however, are only occasional incidents in the quiet progress which as I said before I am convinced your writings are making.I was very glad to hear of Burroughs. I still owe him a letter of thanks for his Winter Sunshine.I Enclose a draft for the Equivalent of sixty dollars. Please send the parcel to me at the following address WinsteadTemple Road,Rathmines.Dublin. And now, dear friend, goodbye. Be sure that any tidings of you, good or the reverse of good, will always be of great concern to me, & write a line when it suits you, but at no other time.Yours always,Edward DowdenP.S. If you have any Magazine articles why not try The Gentlemans Magazine—if a poem, or—better—if prose The Fortnightly Review?But have a 2ndhi> copy of the MS made to avoid the risk of its being lost—I strongly incline to think Morley of the Fortnightly Review would be glad to hear from you, if you have anything suitable.It also occurs to me that some arrangement might be come to with MessrsMessieurs Chatto & Windus to publish your Two Rivulets &c., & give you a royalty on copies sold. I will writ to Rossetti about this. Edward Dowden to Walt Whitman, 16 February 1876"
