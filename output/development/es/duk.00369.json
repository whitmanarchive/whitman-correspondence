A. . I also went to your residence but found you absent I enquired where you had gone & when you would be at home I could get no information on that subject, therefore I returned to the Hospital then to this Camp.I was disappointed in not seeing you I came over on that Errand. But alas I came back without seeing you.Perhaps I will see you before I am sent a way to the front if possibleOrders are very strict in this camp also through out the defences of Washington that is one reason why I had rather be sent to the Regiment I would not stay around this City the rest of my time in service for a considerable a mount of Pork & Soft BreadWalt yours I received after I returned from the City to the Camp. It came all right side upI was very glad to have you write & I will scribble this as an answer at your request that you may know I received your kind & welcome letter. My best wishes are with you for indeed I have found a Friend at last to the poor SoldierI will close this by hopeing[hoping] to hear from you againEver Your Friend Reuben Farwell to Walt Whitman, 5 May 1864"
