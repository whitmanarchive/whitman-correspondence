    "text": "9. South CollegeNew Haven CtOct 7th 1875Dear Sir:—I send you a copy of the Yale Lit for Nov 74 containing an article \"W. W.\" You will see at a glance that it is simply a condensed of Mr. Burroughs' \"Notes\"—a Westminster Review Article abtabout your Democratic Vistas.I have not sent it to you before because somehow or other I have not had the courage. I feared lest what you have said in \"Calamus\"—your cautions to would be pupils of yours—might be true.I hope that you will not be offended at the imperfect way in which I have tried to express my faith in you. I first became acquainted with your books some four or five years ago and from them I have not only learned faith & courage but have become desirous of seeing you yourself. This last pleasure has been denied me; but one of the pleasantest memories of my life is the recollection of an hour passed with your mother in the summer of '72.The passage marked ] is disjointed, for the false delicacy of the Ed's of Lit kept out some remarks upon the physical degeneracy of our women.Very RespectfullyPhilip HaleToWalt WhitmanCamdenN. J. Philip Hale to Walt Whitman, 7 October 1875"
