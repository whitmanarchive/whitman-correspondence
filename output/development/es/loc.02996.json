    "text": "Belmont MassApril 8 89Dear W. W.With yr welcome card came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley, accepting my MS. \"Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity.\" He is going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants me to cut out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are essential,—guess I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard—says \"it wd be a vast pity if the book were to fall through,\" owing to my obstinacy I suppose he means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.I too have a terrific cold in head. Am deaf in one ear temporarily, through sitting by open window (necessarily) where I work. But it is nothing. Wax in ear only.We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank you for the news fr. O'C. the Transcripts are so thin I am ashamed to send 'em half the time. But it is little trouble, & you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances to Traubel &c. It does one good to think of Dr. Bucke. One well man at least, ha, ha, thank God for 'em those hearty \"fellers.\" I take great delight in dogs for same reason.W. S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 8 April 1889"
