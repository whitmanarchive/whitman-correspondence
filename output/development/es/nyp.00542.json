    "text": "Answ'd July 27/85.328 Mickle StreetCamden New JerseyJune 11 '85—noonThe picture arrived this morning—it is a splendid piece of work & I feel sure a good likeness—At any rate it is that rare bird a perfect photo—& I am mighty glad to get it—it leans against the wall before me this moment with the Bacon—(I am ashamed to say never before acknowledged—but it is in my little sitting room & before my eyes every day—more than half the time is taken for Shakspere)—I am about as well as usual in general health—full as well—but laid by with lameness—added to by a fall two months ago & turning my ankle in. I hear from Dr Bucke and John Burroughs—both well—Doctor busy as a bee—both vehement in hospitable invitations to me which I should be most glad to accept—but I find it best not to stray too far from my own chair & bed—Mrs Gilchrist has a strong article abt L. of G. &c printed in the \"To-day,\" cheap radical English magazine for June—I shall probably have some soon & will send you one—It is equal to the 1872 piece—How are you? Any prospect of decapitation? How is Nelly? Give my best love & remembrances to her? I am comfortable here in my shanty. I suppose you get the papers & pieces I send—So long, dear friend—W. W. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 11 June 1885"
