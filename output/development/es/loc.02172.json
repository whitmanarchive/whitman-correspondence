    "text": "23rd December 1886.12. Well Road. HampsteadLondon England.My dear Walt: I received yryour post-card this week, and frwrdforwarded it to Leonard M. Brown, as I thought it would please him. He is a very nice man,—young, a school master;—something very striking about him:—Brown intends going to America next summer, when no doubt he will call upon you. You have not acknowledged Richard Colles' ￡2. sent by me per money order before Browns ￡5. and I have also remitted to you 14s.6d from Cambridge friends, since I sent Brown's, kindly let me know about these two sums soon as you can. Glad to have pretty good accounts of you. You make no allusion to my Book or my little confidences thereon: do you care for a copy? Herbert H. Gilchrist. Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 23 December 1886"
