    "text": "Belmont MassJuly 10 '86Mr Dear Whitman:Yrsyours of the 8th recd.receivedYes; I rec'dreceivedKnortz's pam.pamphlet in same mail with yryour letter. I have read it & find it good—comprehensive, scholarly, & fair. I wdwould not want a better or more complete introduction to the whole German nation than that contained in his pamphlet. I see no trace of clericalism in it. He devotes five pages to an earnest & unqualified defense of Children of Adam though as he says, you do \"smoke pretty strong tobacco\" [!] in those poems. He finds \"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking\" the finest, tenderest & most soul mastering Bird—idyl[idyll] in the whole literature of the world. He covers the whole ground (hastily) without however, rising ever into any very profound or original thought. Did you find that letter of Rhys's? I will gladly accept yryour suggestion as to title \"Walt Whitman\" &c I shdshould like very much to have something about Scovel to put in if anybody cdcould give me a few data. He has been such a good friend. I know Donaldson so little that I hardly know whether to clan him with Burroughs & O'Connor or not: I hardly dare to state here on paper the uncertainties I feel about him. You see how that I have written about him strikes you when you come to read the MS. I may omit it altogether. I have preluded & bragged so much (as is my naïve way) that I guess I'd better give you now a hint as to the \"spine\" of my book. It is a good deal of a melange; but I believe the back-bone idea of it lies in the word \"apotheosis.\" Here are the contents: Chap I Enfans d'AdamII Whitman's Title To GreatnessIII The Style of Leaves of GrassIV Analytical Introduction To Leaves of GrassV Democrat & ComradeVII Passage to IndiaVII Walt Whitman and His Friends1 Appendix (Conway & Jay C. Goldsmith.)2 Concordance3 Bibliography The first three chapters attempt to once & for all set at rest the uncertainty as to the purity & supreme worth of Leaves of Grass, & the greatness of W. W. as a man & author. They form a tremendous eulogium, & seem to me to be exhaustive & unanswerable. The next three chapters are interpretative & analytical chiefly. The seventh is personal. But I must stop & get to work on it. For serious interruptions are looming up in the near future. A publisher buttonholed me in Boston yesterday. One of these scorcher days nearly used me up. Glad you are well as usual. Thanks for yryour news abtabout J.B. & Dr. B. EdwdEdward Carpenter has sent me a really fine article of his on Simplification of Life. I know it is his by the style. aff.affectionatelyWS Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 10 July 1886"
