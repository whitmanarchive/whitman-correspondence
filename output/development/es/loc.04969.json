    "text": "Washington. June 20, 1872Dear Sir:In transmitting to you the last part of the translation, I beg once more leave to ask your forbearance. I know very well, that it is to say the least, a weak translation, but considering the original I was unable to do it better. I have marked some places with ? because the word used does not suit me, but neither in my head nor in my dictionary was I able to find any other.Trusting however that this it must be of some use to you,I remain sir,YoursEmil Arctander Emil Arctander to Walt Whitman, 20 June 1872"
