My health though poor is \"the same subject continued\"—I enc: K[enne]dy's letter from Wilson—(not important)—Rhys is still in Boston—Morse in Indiana—I like Eakins' picture (it is like sharp cold cutting true sea brine)—I have not heard a word of the Worthington suit in N Y—not a word from my dear friend O'C[onnor] in Wash'n—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 8 April 1888"
