Ed has been real sick the past two weeks he caught a heavy cold it settled on the stomach & bowls[bowels] I was afraid inflamation[inflammation] would set in but he has got better & is now able to work some. he has gone down to Mont[']s to day[today]. Pap is much better I think by spring he will be as well as usual. The money you sent by Herbert I distributed as you directed the remaining 8 dollarsI gave to pap as he has a hundred 100. dollars to make up by the 25th & we have had so much bad luck this year he does not know just where the money is to come from Aunt Hannah is still with me her Daughter pays 2 dollars per week for her board while she is here. I got a letter from Ruth last night they seem to be geting[getting] on out there & they like the place & people.I thought I would like to go home I mean to my Brother[']s at Bridgeport the 20th of this month he has asked me to come. I don't know whether I will be able to get off or not I would like to go & have a few days rest if I can get some good body to keep house for me while all seem to be well Harry & Eva were at home yesterdaythey were well Harry has not got any thing[anything] to do yet he has began[begun] to think the Rail Road company is not going to give him a thing to do.
