    "text": "HartfordMar. 6th/88Direct#15 Washington StDear Uncle Walt.I am afraid you will think my promise to write to you was not sincere but I have had very little time to myself for letter writing but now that I have set about to redeem my word I hope it will be welcome and receive a speedy reply from you. To begin at the beginning of my visit I spent nearly three weeks in New York with Mr. & Mrs. Northen and of course had a splendid opportunity of going about and seeing all I wanted in New York. I was quite fortunate with regard to the weather as I believe we only had two real stormy days while I was there. One thing I enjoyed about as much as any was the exhibition of pictures out at the Museum in the Park. Miss Woolf's collection, the very rich lady who died a year or so ago, was there also a large number of others including the one given by Vanderbilt called \"The Horse Fair.\" I believe looking at beautiful pictures and hearing good music are my chief pleasures with of course reading added the last a thing one could hardly exist without.I went over to Brooklyn to call on Jo. Barkelor. You of course remember her, she was so fond Grandma and is one of your ardent admirers. I did enjoy seeing her so much as I was unfortunate to miss her when I called last July as she had sailed for Europe the day before.She is a very lovely and smart woman. Well to proceed with my trip I left New York on the twentieth of February for Hartford and have enjoyed my visit so far very much. These friends were new last fall but I almost feel as if I had known them always, particularly one from Ireland who is on a visit to America for the first time. Next Saturday I go to another friend's house for a couple of weeks which will about end my traveling about and turn my face once more towards Burlington. Do write me very soon and accept lots of love fromYour nieceJessie Whitman Jessie Louisa Whitman to Walt Whitman, 6 March 1888"
