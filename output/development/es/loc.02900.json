    "text": "Belmont, Mass.Aug. 2 / 86.Dear Walt Whitman,I send the MS to-day by Adams Express. Return at my expense by ditto. Take yryour time. I am dissatisfied with the thing.—as I always am with any work when done. But in this case I feel particularly blue—after all my rooster-crowing—for anything put beside yryour writing dwindles immediately. The MS. is not done, & never would be: I have simply suspended work. I cdcould write forever on L. of G. because its scope is infinite. Have made the acquaintance of Sidney Morse. Good talks with him. He is going to bust you again in the Autumn! A good fellow! bye byeW. S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 2 August 1886"
