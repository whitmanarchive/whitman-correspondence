Butts,CamdenFeb. 8, '74.O'Kane has undoubtedly sent you all the copies of my books remaining in his possession—he received originally (April 28 '73 from Doolady,) 239 Leaves of Grass100 As a Strong Bird,92 Democratic Vistas,45 Notes of John Burroughs, &c. And since then he has delivered about 30 Leaves of of Grass to my order—leaving only 30 or 40 more to be accounted for as sales &c. so that, as just said, he has unquestionably retained none in his possession. As said in my note, you now, (with the exception of about 350 copies of As A Strong Bird, which are at my printer's in N.Y., & which I can send you an order for,) you now have all my books in the market. (The edition you have, L. of G. only consisted of 500 copies, when issued, over a year & a half ago.)Will write you again early this week, anent of your yesterdays letter, offer, &c.So that now, (with the exception of perhaps 350 of the little book, As a Strong Bird on store in N.Y., which I can send you an order for, if you wish, at once.) you have all my books in the market. I will write you more specifically early this week anent of your yesterday's letter offer, &c.Walt Whitman.O'Kane has not sent me yet his statement, or acc't—not a word Walt Whitman to Asa K. Butts & Company, 8 February 1874"
