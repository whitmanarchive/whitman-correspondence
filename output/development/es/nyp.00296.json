    "text": "BrooklynFriday afternoon Oct. 14Dear William O'Connor,I have just rec'd your letter. To make the matter certain won't you take thirty or forty minutes & go down to the St. Cloud—look at the rooms, & pick out one for me?—positively engaging it—You know what is good as well as I do, (I mean for me)—I shall want a room at least for a few weeks—& perhaps for the winter—& for that season one is not so particular about the location—(But perhaps you have already engaged for me at St. C. a specific room.)lovinglyWalt. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 14 October [1870]"
