    "text": "ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington. Dec. 10, 1866.My dear friend, Yours of the 8th has just come. I am glad indeed to hear that you are free from asthma, & are feeling well.I should be truly happy to become acquainted with Mrs. Andrews—I am sure I should like her much.For a month or so, I have not been very well—my trouble takes the form, sometimes, of neuralgia—but is a complication—(the doctor says it probably all dates from that time I got saturated with hospital malaria)—But I keep around, & go to the office just the same—& now for four of five days have felt much better—The O'Connors are well—The consul at Rio Janeiro is James Munroe—Our Minister to Brazil, resident in Rio Janeiro, is James Watson Webb. I send my love to Helen and Emmy & all—I have rec'd a letter from mother to-day—she seems to be about the same as usual—I hope Helen or Emmy will just go over & visit her without ceremony as often as possible. Give my respects to Mr. Arnold—also to Mr. Price—It would give me the greatest pleasure to see you or Helen here in Washington. I rec'd your friend's (Katy Hinds) letter at the time—I have had no letter from Mr. Parker's family—I am writing this by my window in the office—it is a fine view, ten miles of river, & away across to Virginia hills, ever so far—My place is an easy & pleasant one here in the Att'y Gen's. office—And now for the present, dear friend, Farewell.Walt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 10 December 1866"
