    "text": "50 Marquis Rd.Camden Sq. N.W.Dec. 8, 1873My dearest FriendThe papers with Prof:Professor Young's speech came safely & I read it, my hand in yours, happy and full of interest.—Are you getting on my Darling? When I know that you no longer suffer from distressing sensations in the head & can move without such effort and difficulty a hymn of thankfulness will go up from my heart. Perhaps this week I shall get the paper with the line on it that is to tell me so much— or at least that you are well on your way towards it.—And what shall I tell you about? The quiet tenor of our daily lives here? but that is very restricted, though I trust as far as it goes, good & healthful. Or the thoughts and hopes that leap from across the ocean & the years? But they hide themselves away when I want to put them into words. Do not think I live in dreams. I know very well it is strictly in proportion as the present & the past have been busy shaping & preparing the materials of a beautiful future, that it really will be beautiful when it comes to exist as a present, seeing how it needs must be entirely a growth from all that has preceded it & that there are no sudden creations of flowers of happiness in men & women any more than in the fields. But if the buds lie ready folded ah what the sunshine will do! What fills me with such deep joy in your poems is the sense of the large complete acceptiveness—the full & perfect faith in humanity—in every individual unit of humanity thus for the first time uttered. That alone satisfies the sense of justice in the soul, responds to what its own nature compels it to believe of the Infinite Source of all. That too includes within its scope the lot as well as the man. His infinite, undying self must achieve and fulfil itself out of any & all experiences. Why if it takes such ages & such vicissitudes to compact a bit of rock—fierce heat, & icy cold, storms deluges, crushing pressure & slow subsidences as if it were like a handful of years & all sunshine would do for a man!— Dec. 18The longed for paper has come to hand. O it is a slow struggle back to health my Darling! I believe in the main it is good news that is come—and there is the little stroke I wanted so on the address. But for all that I feel troubled & conscious—for I believe you have been a great deal worse since you wrote—and that you have still such a steep steep hill to climb. Perhaps if my hand were in yours dear Walt, you would get along faster—Dearer and sweeter that lot than even to have been your bride in the full flush & strength and glory of your youth. I turn my face to the westward sky before I lie down to sleep, deep & steadfast within me the silent aspiration that every year, every month & week may help something to prepare and make fitter me and mine to be your comfort and joy. We are full of imperfections shortcomings but half developed, but half \"possessing our own souls.\" But we grow, we learn we strive—that is the best of us. I think in the sunshine of your presence we shall grow fast I too, my years notwithstanding May the New Year lead you out into the sunshine again—shed out of its days health & strength so that you tread the earth in gladness again. This, with love from us all. Good bye dearest FriendAnne Gilchrist.Herby was at a Conversation last night where were many distinguished men & beautiful women. Among the works of art displayed on the walls was a fine photograph of you. 19th, afternoon.And now a later post has brought me the other No.number of the Graphic with your own writing in it—so full of life and spirit so fresh & cheerful & vivid dear Friend it seems to scatter all anxious sad thoughts to the winds. And are you then really back at Washington I wonder or have you only visited it in spirit, & written the recollection of former evenings. I shall have none but cheerful thoughts now. I shall reread it carefully—read it to the young folk at tea tonight. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 8–19 December 1873"
