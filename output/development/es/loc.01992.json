    "text": "SyracuseFeb 24th/1868Dear Friend Walt,at last I have got started to reply to your letter, recdreceived some weeks ago: I do not know but you think by this time that I have forgotten you, but far from itI think of you every day and always with Love.I have promised myself every week since I received your letter that I would write to you and as often I have failed to keep my promise.Mother recdreceived a letter from Father to daytoday stating that he had seen you several times since he came to Washington.I do not remember whether I ever told you or not that Father was insane at times, we have had him in the asylum at Utica nearly two years, but it is now two years since he left that place, & he has been a source of anxiety to Us since as well as before he went there, we are afraid he is out of his head now a little.When he left here he said he was going to New York as agent for a firm in this city & the next we hear of him he is in Washington trying to get some Patent which we would be very glad if he would come home & let it alone.I have commenced work again after being idle nearly three months, and I am very glad to have something to do once more.The weather has been very cold for the last three days & we have had good sleighing nearly all winter.Mother & My Wife send their regards to you.I will try and write more promptly next time, so good bye for the Present.from your FriendB.H. Wilson. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 24 February 1868"
