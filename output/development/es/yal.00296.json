    "text": "Belmont Mass.March 7: '88I was really astonished to hear my quondam college mate—young Henry Norman—was the one who engineered the Pall Mall Gazette subscription. I always knew Norman had a soft spot 'way down deep in him somewhere. There was a race-antipathy between us, however. I suspect I was the one who first introduced you to him. For when we were in college together in Cambridge Mass. I was in the first flush of my enthusiasm for you; had just read you for the first time, & after a while I came out & made a solemn confession of faith before the whole Divinity School—Professors & all— & told them what I had found in you. They were a band of earnest liberal fellows (Norman & I the best read of 'em) & I saw that they did not laugh, & that my solemnity impressed them. I suspect, my dear friend, that you–being of English & Dutch stock—do not find in you the race-antipathy that I—a French-Scotch-Irish-Englishman find in me.As to Norman—It is what we might expect to find one of yryour opposites seeking you for inspiration. He certainly needs you, if any man does—in the heart department he is quite stony—veilled by culture & Unitarianism (or was 8 yrsyears ago: I suspect he has mellowed since that) His father is a wealthy Unitarian manufacturer of Leicester County England. Norman is intellectually brilliant, & no mistake. We have had some tiffs in the Critic. But I wish him well. His pam.pamphlet on the Irish evictions won my sympathy, & now what Rhys tells me of this Pall Mall matter increases my esteem. We must eeneven love him, Hal. I suppose.I had a crazy, crazy letter from poor Mid. Alabama fellow. He is in trouble of some sort. Sent me his name & $5 for the book. He is a very sore-headed crank still over his visit to you.I have some score of names of subscribers sent to me. How many bro.brotherWilson rec'dreceived I dont know.Rhys continues his schemes on society's pocket-book, & demoralizes my nerves frightfully when I see him, somehow. Charity, charity, man, I keep saying (& think of my own grievous sins). I send you a Transcript marked, and also send you my love in unlimited quantities. Remember me cordially to Scovel if you remember it. Love to the canary-bird, & the dog, & respects to Mrs. Davis.Good night & noble dreams be ours enbosomed in a mystic universe as we are.W.S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 7 March 1888"
