    "text": "Friday afternoon [March] Louisa Van Velsor Whitman struck out \"Feb.\" and inserted \"march.\" 72 o'clockDear mother,I got your letter yesterday Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of March 4, 1873, dealt mostly with Jeff and his children (Trent Collection, Duke University). —I was glad to hear all the things you wrote— every thing, however little, is interesting, when you are kept in nearly all the time— I have rec'd a very good letter from Hannah this morning—she writes in good spirits, & wants you & me to come up there next Summer Hannah, as Walt Whitman observed, wrote \"in good spirits\" on March 4, 1873, to her mother and to her brother—no whining, no hypochondriacal wailing, and no reports about Heyde's behavior (Trent Collection, Duke University). —says Heyde thinks of going off then to the Adirondack, on a trip— To-day is very pleasant indeed—the cold spell seems to be over for the present— I have been out (about noon) quite a while—Mrs. O'Connor came to visit me, & as I was all dressed, & it was so pleasant, I went out—she convoyed me— I didn't go far, but stopt in at one or two places, near by—have now returned, have just eat a bite of lunch, and am feeling quite comfortable— sit here now alone writing this—as I told you in my last, I am getting along well, but it is very, very slow—I cannot begin to apply my brain to regular work yet— though, for all that, I have written two or three little poems for the Graphic,The New York Daily Graphic published a number of Walt Whitman's poems and prose pieces in 1873 and 1874. In the former year the Daily Graphic printed the following works: \"Nay, Tell Me Not To-day the Publish'd Shame\" on March 5, 1873, \"With All the Gifts, America\" on March 6, 1873, \"The Singing Thrush\" (later entitled \"Wandering at Morn\") on March 15, 1873, \"Spain\" on March 24, 1873, \"Sea Captains, Young or Old\" (later called \"Song for All Seas, All Ships\") on April 4, 1873, \"Warble for Lilac-Time\" on May 12, 1873, \"Halls of Gold and Lilac\" on November 24, 1873, and \"Silver and Salmon-Tint\" on November 29, 1873. In 1874, the Daily Graphic printed \"A Kiss to the Bride\" on May 21, 1874, \"Song of the Universal\" on June 17, 1874, and \"An Old Man's Thought of School\" on November 3, 1874. David G. Croly (1829–1889) was editor of the Graphic until 1878. From 1862 to 1872 he had been managing editor of the New York World, a newspaper which had been sympathetic to Walt Whitman. Croly, described in Dictionary of American Biography as \"an iconoclast and a reformer,\" was the author of Miscegenation (1864), which proposed the blending of the two races for the survival of civilization. See also Horace Traubel, ed., With Walt Whitman in Camden (1906–1964), 5 vols., 3:560–561. a N. Y. daily evening paper just commenced—(one of them was in the number for last Wednesday)—they pay me moderately— I was glad you got a letter from Mary Mary Van Nostrand, Walt Whitman's sister. On March 4, 1873, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman expressed hope that she and Walt Whitman could visit Mary during the summer: \"i think it would doo us both good, so we must both get so we can walk without limping\" (Trent Collection, Duke University). —if you write tell her I am improving— John Burroughs is just in to see me, having returned for a while to Washington— Well, mother dear, I will bid you good bye for this week—Love to you & to Brother George & Sister Lou & all— Walt.
