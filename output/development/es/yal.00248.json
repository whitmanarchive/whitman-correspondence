Note in the box rec'd & welcomed—I am feeling quite well for me—If you see J Miller tell him I like much his piece to me in the January Galaxy—it is full of the fieriest horses, held well in hand—tell him to write to me—I shall send you a newspaper to-morrow with some little poems to me extracted, Miller's among them—When you read it & are through, give it to J M— Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 31 December [1876]"
