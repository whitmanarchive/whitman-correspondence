    "text": "Dear Mr. Walt Whitman: I am grieved to hear that you have been so unwell and can only trust that your physician is a true prophet, and that you will recover and be as well as ever. I have myself known a case of cerebral an√¶mia in a young lady living near me. She lost her mind and no one who saw her believed she could live; but under the superintendence of a good doctor she has perfectly recovered and looks plumper and fresher than ever she did before.This is the first letter I have written for weeks, and I am afraid I write rather obscurely, for my hand and arm have been crippled with rheumatism (I hope it is not gout), and I am not yet perfectly recovered.I was beholden to you for your Democratic Vistas, and if I did not answer and acknowledge them I regret to have done so; but if you knew how great the mass of my correspondence is, and how much I dislike letter-writing, I doubt not, you would forgive me easily.When I next hear of or from you may the news be that you are fully re-established in your old vigor and body: Meanwhile believe meYours everA Tennyson Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to Walt Whitman, [8 July 1874]"
