    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,30 Sept 1888I did not write you yesterday—had a couple of men here to look at meter and Gurd & myself were with them all day. One of them a big capitalist and manufacturer from Montreal. No definite announcement made with them—and may not be—but they were pretty impressed by the meter and I expect they will make us a proposition. Our fine weather left us right in the middle of fair week—i.e. last week has got very cold dark & dull all at once, rains more or less every day—altogether dismal decidedly—I am looking out anxiously for \"N.B.\" & \"C.W.\" hope to get the first any how this week and the other next week at latest. Johnston has written me for a likeness of myself to be used in an article on \"Walt and his friends\" Have not had one taken for years—shall go in tomorrow (if all well) and have one done—shall of course send you a copy—Maurice\" goes to Toronto in morning to college again. I shall have to get at my lectures on \"mental diseases\" for the students at medical college here as soon as possible—meanwhile I have not more than half written \"Annual Report.\" Such is life!Love to youRM BuckeSee notes Oct 2, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 30 September 1888"
