Indeed you have had, since the sad event of thirteen years ago, (does it seem so long?) a central place in the heart of the home and it was there I met and welcomed you.Now another change is about to take place: (and who knows whether life or death is more momentous?) the marriage of Grace.You know how lovely she is in voice and feature: but you cannot know how every best quality of her parents is mingled into a perfect whole.
