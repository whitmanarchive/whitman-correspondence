    "text": "Dear Walt WhitmanThe MS. to—hand I am very glad indeed, & thankful, for all the capital suggestions & amendments you have made. I have followed them all, or am doing it. I have a good many little additions to make myself—things which the close work of concordance-making suggested to me. I will cut out everything you advise. As to Ballou & Scovel, I will cut out nearly everything of Ballou's retaining only a little to put with large quotations from Scovel's article. I can improve that personal chapter very much by working it over, smoothing down & melding things together more. How wd that MS—\"Of That Blithe Throat\" &c—You gave me, do for a fac-simile page to put into the Bibliography where I speak of your typographical finesse &c? Or wd you prefer to send me a clean draft of something in case the publishers thought best to give the fac-simile? People like to see the erasures &c I believe. I have thought that I might perhaps get more from Chatto & Windus if I guaranteed them for three years against the republication of the book in this country. I am going to copyright it, here right away, or very soon. What wd you say to this—guaranteeing the British publisher the market? An error in L. of G. By the way I suppose of course you have noticed that the characters \"§ 9\" of the Salut are by mistake omitted in L. of G.I have a nice letter form Scovel wh. I shall answer. The hot weather has worked on me a little too. As ever dear Walt W.S. Kennedy I will omit Conway & Goldsmith entirely, & not sorry to do it. If Morse makes a bust satisfactory to you, I shall have picture of it in the book. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, [18 August 1886]"
