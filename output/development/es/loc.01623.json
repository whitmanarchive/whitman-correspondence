    "text": "1873431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N.J.Nov.November 21.18731873Dear Son Pete,Nothing very new with me—I continue about the same—my general strength the best it has been yet—I go out a little most every day, but it is very cold weather here—I was quite non-plus'dnonplussed at that affair in Bergazzi's with Frank Rives—who is he? Is he some one I know? Was he drunk or loony? tell me more of it—what he said—the exact words—It seems unaccountable to me—from what I gather from your letter you did exactly right. If I hadn't met with some queer characters myself—& been the subject of such strange & unaccountable remarks—I should hardly think any thing of the sort possible—I have occupied myself lately writing—have sent a letter to the Graphic, describing the Capitol, which they have accepted, and may publish Saturday or Monday. Have also written a poem which I have sold—will send you one when it appears.—As I write this holding the paper on my lap I am sitting here in the parlor, by the heater—have had my dinner—drank quite a goblet of wine, which I believe has flown into my head. (My brother west, & another friend here, have both sent me presents of good wine—& I drink it occasionally, half water—but this time I have taken a little extra)——Pete, I thought I would send you a couple of shirts—so I have ordered them made here, got as near the measure as I could—they will be done in some ten days, perhaps less, & then I will send them. I like mine so well, I have had yours made like them, with collars on. I have had no new togs made this winter. I wear my old gray suit, & the old black overcoat,—& when very cold, or stormy my gray shawl—If you should see me now leaning against Milburn's counter, you wouldn't see any difference from last winter—(but my heart tells a different story)I have been in all day, & must get out a little—the evenings are the most tedious with me—I can manage to put in the days, but these long cold evenings, I think if I only had the right quarters in Washington, my own quarters & a good wood fire, & you with me as often as possible, I should be comparatively happyWalt— Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 21 November [1873]"
