There was to be a meeting of the N E Womans' Club, (somewhat swell) last Monday Evn'g—at wh' Kennedy was invited to take a hand—as I & mine were to be the themes—& K requested of me to send him replicas of Morse's plaster h'd & Cox's new photo, wh' I did—furthermore see letter—A dull spell of weather here—cloudy & raw—I don't get out or around much—going out to-morrow—Thanksgiving dinner, to my friends Mrs and Mr Lawyer Harned—turkey & champagne—always have something good to drink, & plenty of it—(H. has the best whiskey in America)—& a blazing wood fire—also a charming little girl & boy—I go there quite often—In the London budget in N Y Tribune Nov. 22, is a short letter (extract) from Tennyson to me—rather curious—nothing important—I sent T. one of Cox's photos of me (the \"laughing philosopher\")—& this I suppose is an answer or part thereof—but how it got out & in cable is funny—Dear O'C, I havn't heard from you in a month. Write soon, do. Dear Maurice, yours of 20th came this morning. Ernest Rhys has not arrived here yet, but I am looking for him. Morse is here to-day. Mr Eakins of Phila: has commenced painting me. A bouncing Thanksgiving week to you both—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor and Richard Maurice Bucke, 23 November 1887"
