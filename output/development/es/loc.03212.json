    "text": "(from Eleanor Lawney | young woman)201 East Broadway, Louisville, Ky.May 11, 1884Dear Mr. Whitman:Do your remember how I visited you in Camden one day last June? Perhaps you will remember me by the bouquet of ferns and larkspurs. Now I am out here, and circumstances contrary to my wishes, will keep me here indefinitely.This is one of my homesick days, and I have been thinking over what there is in the north that I would so much like to see, and hear, and among other things I think how much I would like to see you again, and hear you say, as you did before, \"I'm glad you came!\" I often think about you, and you have written so many lines for me that I wish to say a word back.When I read I say \"Yes, I am she, O you wise poet,\" and sometimes I think I must put out my hand for you; and I am sure that we have gone together down that brown road a great many times; and perhaps it was my pulse that you heard, like \"little tinkling bells.\" I am very glad my eyes found the message you hid away for meâ€”hid so deeply, though, that I barely found it, and at first doubted if there was a message there, or if it was for me.I love you very much, and feel toward you, as toward all strong and true people, a sense of obligation.In glad acknowledgement of your companionship, and hoping for you all good things,Your friend,Eleanor M. Lawney. Eleanor Lawney to Walt Whitman, 11 May 1884"
