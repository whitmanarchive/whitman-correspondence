I know she wouldenjoy so much the meeting you and seeing you.If you cannot come as I fear you cannot, she would prize very much a few words of regret from your own hand. If you will send it here, I will see that she gets it.Miss Gale is one of our most, if not our most promising young actorsâ€”Wishing we might have the pleasure of seeing you.Very sincerelySophia Wells Royce Williams Sophia Williams to Walt Whitman, 24 November 1890"
