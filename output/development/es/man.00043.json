C.(TRADE MARK COPYRIGHTED.)June 26, 1880Dear Walt,I rec'dreceived your Postal and am glad you are having such a good time.Hinton's wife died night before last. Poor fellow! he is in the depths, he loved her deeply, intensely, she arrived from London only a week ago yesterday, he wishes me to tell Dr Bucke that as soon as he can turn around he will \"Write about Walt\" have it appear in the Mail perhaps and will make it what the Dr needs.Albert graduated all O.K. I question whether he gets to Camden this Summer. Tell the Dr. that with seven to support, I dont have much surplus to let them go on long journeys. Moreover I need him in the store with me, if I go to Colorado next month he will look after things here.I will do my best to send the Dr something while I am on my vacation.Give my love to him, and commend me to his wife and little ones.Alma and Calder are doing well. We go to Equinunk a week from yesterdayJHJ John H. Johnston to Walt Whitman, 26 June 1880"
