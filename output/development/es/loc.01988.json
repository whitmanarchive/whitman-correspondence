    "text": "SyracuseFeb 3rd 1867Walt Whitman,Dear FriendSunday Evening has come around again and I find myself again employed in the pleasant duty of answering one of your ever welcome letters. I rec'd yours of Jan 31st last night, and will not lose any time in answering it this time, but I do not know as you will approve of my writing on Sundays, but that is about the only time I have for writing except evenings and then my hands tremble so from my work (which is nearly all done by the hands) that I can scarcely write inteligibly[intelligibly] so I feel certain you will excuse me. I also received your \"Leaves\" of \"Grass\" and the pamphlet the \"Good\" \"Gray\" Poet, which I shall prize so highly that no money could purchase it but I do not know as you ought to have sent it to me for I do not know as you could afford it, but I will try and repay you for it, if in no other way than Love which I can give from the heart.The vindication I have read part of it and Father has read the rest of it to us, and I shall take the liberty of disagreeing with you in regard to his thinking more of you than you deserve for you deserve his love as well as that of thousands of others myself included, and I wish you to give him my best regards and tell him I am one of friends that that was visited in Armory Square Hospital by his Good, Gray, Poet, Walt Whitman, and that I hope some day to make his acquaintance in person. I think Mr O'Connor was perfectly sane in writing his vindication, and I thank you very much for sending it to me for it has done me good already.When I get to thoroughly reading your Book I shall probably have some questions to ask but I shall not get as bigoted as Secretary Harlan, and wish to turn you out of employment for your plainness of speech for I have failed as yet to find any indecent passages.I have been talking and thinking very strongly of going to South America next spring to be gone a year or two and see if I could not get into something there that would be of benefit to me financially. I have not decided what part of the country I would go to yet and I want to get your advice on the subject for I am not very well posted. Give me your opinion freely, and say whatever you wish to say on any subject. If I should go I would try to spend a day or two with you in WashingtonI will try and give you a better letter next time I write, for I am not in very good writing mood to night[tonight]. enclosed is some cards Fac Simile of those I sent you in the letter you did not get. I did not know but you would like to have them.from your Loving Soldier BoyB.H. Wilson. Benton H. Wilson to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1867"
