    "text": "see notes Oct 24 1888MESSRS MACKMURDO & HORNE ARCHITECTS AND ATTHE TEMPLE, DALE STREET,LIVERPOOL. 28, Southampton Street.Strand, W.C.Oct: 1 1888Dear Mr. Whitman.I have asked our new agents for America to send you a copy of the October number of the Hobby Horse, hoping you may find something in it to interest you.I am glad to hear from Mrs. Costelloe that you have recovered from your late illness. Ernest Rhys, who is now away in Wales, brought back golden accounts of the delightful time he had in America & during his stay with you.I do not know if you write much fresh work now. But if you could see your way to send us some little contribution of your own for our magazine, nothing would give us greater pleasure. Unlike in so many ways as our own efforts may seem to your poetry, we have a very genuine and good admiration for your work, and to see your name on our pages, although the contribution be only a few lines, we should regard as a distinct priviledge[privilege]. I believe you are aware that the Hobby Horse is entirely a labour of love.Sincerely yoursHerbert P. HorneNow that Herbert Gilchrist is in Philadelphia I suppose you see him often. Pray give my love to him & say I am expecting a letter saying when I may write to him. Herbert P. Horne to Walt Whitman, 1 October 1888"
