    "text": "9th Nov. 82My dear WaltI have your card of 6th and we shall count on your coming here early in Dec. to spend the winter with us—the next question is shall I go to Philadelphia for you or meet you at the Falls? You can get a train by which you can run through to the Falls without change so that there would not be any difficulty in coming that far alone if you were feeling pretty well (I must caution you however about talking too long to those goodlooking girls at Homersville as you might get left). But would it not be as well (or necessary) for me to go to Philadelphia to arrange for the publication of my book in the Spring? Or can you arrange this without me? And if I do not go myself will it not be necessary to send the M.S. with copies of the illustrations? Let me know at your earliest convenience what you think of all this: We are all well and Mrs. B., as well as myself, is much pleased at the prospect of seeing you so soon—don't disappoint us.I am affectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1882"
