We are all well and flourishing. I am just finishing Romanes \"Origin of the Human Faculty\" the best book I have read for a long time. I have been hoping to hear something definite as to the publication of W.S. Kennedy's \"W.W.\" but I hear nothing—hope to see K. here before a great while but have not heard from him for so long that do not know whether to expect him or not. Inspector has been here three days—will go East tomorrow—all goes well with meter as far as I know but it seems slow workLove to youR M Bucke Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, [17 June] 1889"
