    "text": "Rec'd April 20th1876—J H Johnston431 Stevens st.Camden, NNew JerseyApril 19Dear friend,I have rec'd your letter, money, & order for Joaquin Miller's books, & had just prepared them to send, when I have rec'd a letter from J. M. saying he will soon be in Philadelphia—& that I must lay the books aside for him to take, when he calls personally on me, which will be soon. I am much annoyed about the postage mishap. I have written to the P. M. at New York, & hope he will make restitution,—as the package was not sealed at ends, (only wrapt over & tied, to protect the gilt edges)—at least twenty packages have been sent in precisely the same way (one or two to N.Y.) and this is the only one that has been served so. If the P.M. don't restitute I must be allowed to pay it—not because it is important, but because it is my affair—& business—I send you an extra copy of my little War book, same mail with this—Shall write you soon definitely about coming on—Love to you, my friend, & to Mrs. J.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 19 April [1876]"
