Good night! as we so oft have saidBeneath this roof, at midnight, in the daysthat are no moreAnd will no more return.Thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed,I stay a little longer, as one staysTo gather up the embers that still burn.I had my long drive of 10 miles & back yesterday—was caught in the gale & heavy rain, (rain much needed)—but got home all safe—am ab't as usual—weather changed to quite cool to day here—Love to you & Jess—W.W. Walt Whitman to Thomas Jefferson Whitman, 13 September [1886]"
