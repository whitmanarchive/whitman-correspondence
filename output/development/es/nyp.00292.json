I don't think there is anything very serious, but it has caused me much suffering, since I have been here. If the \"Radical\" has come, send me a copy immediately. Address to No 101 Portland avenue, opposite Arsenal. Mother is well as usual. We both send love to you and Nellie. I expect to be back next Monday.Walt WhitmanBy AHP. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 11 May 1870"
