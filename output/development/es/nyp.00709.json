I am here in the same spot & in not much different conditions—good spirits enough (constitutional I guess, physiological likely)—but almost a complete bodily wreck, cannot get across the room without holding on to something, or being led—have a stout man nurse—go out-doors in wheel chair occasionally was out yesterday at sunset—sell my own books when I can get purchaser—am still rejected by all the magazines—my right arm power & volition good yet—appetite, sleep &c: fair—am now well on my 72d year—have the grip rather bad—cool spell of weather here—Dr Bucke is well—Horace Traubel comes dailyGod bless youWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Ellen M.
