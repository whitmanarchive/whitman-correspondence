    "text": "Morristown N.J.Aug. 31/69My dear Walt Whitman,I have the advantage of you—I know you well—\"My soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each-other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other\"—I hope not though.Good Summer, and this I have been living in the woods, with \"leaves of Grass\" beside me, me of my rustic sympathies.And now that the days are growing cold I will have to content myself indoors. I don't like to—but must soon say good bye to the Grass here by the brook—Many a time while lying on the Bank of the little stream reading your Book—have I wondered just what manner of man is Walt Whitman?—and I have thought of him so much that I seem to know him well—I hope some of these days I may have the pleasure of a visit from him—I am spending my summer very simply in this place—and should be most happy to have Mr. Whitman should a Sunday with me when he can make it convenient to do so—I go to Lome, Mass.&e next week, for a change—but will be at home in a few weeks—and will be pleased to see you at any time—Hope you will pardon my intrusion, but I am anxious to know you better, and would call you friend—Would be pleased to hear from you at any time—Sincerely Yours,Meredith R. Brookfield Meredith R. Brookfield to Walt Whitman, 31 August 1869"
