I wish to convey my best regards to the printers, proof-readers & print-plate presser &c—I have been specially laid up for nearly a year almost entirely disabled—imprison'd in sick room—last fall & during winter sometimes low, serious, but just now easier, comparatively free from pain—getting along better than you might suppose.Our dear friend O'Connor is very ill at Washington (lower legs paralyzed, & lately attacks of epilepsy)—Burroughs is pretty well—is at his place West Park Ulster Co: with his wife & boy (with a book in press, I believe)—Best regards & love to you & yours—Have put off this letter of thanks & good wishes waiting for a day I sh'd feel pretty well to write it in, but such day lagging I delay no longer—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Edmund Clarence Stedman, 31 March 1889"
