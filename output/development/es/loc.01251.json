    "text": "JanJanuary 24th '77Dear EdI want to write you a few lines particular. Do not call to see me any more at the Stafford family, & do not call there at all any more. Dont ask me why—I will explain to you when we meet. When you meet any of the family I wish you to use them just the same as ever, but do not go over there at all. I want you to keep this to yourself, & not mention it nor this letter to any one & you must not speak about it at all to any one.There is nothing in it that I think I do wrong, nor am ashamed of, but I wish it kept entirely between you and me—& I shall feel very much hurt & displeased if you don't keep the whole thing & the present letter entirely to yourself. Mr and Mrs Stafford are very near & kind to me, & have been & are like brother & sister to me—& as to Harry you know how I love him. Ed you too have my unalterable love, & always shall have. I want you to come up here & see me. Write when will you come. Walt Whitman to Edward Cattell, 24 January 1877"
