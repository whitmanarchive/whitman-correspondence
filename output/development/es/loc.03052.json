Tucker + he wd take nothing of course for six copies of the paper on William. Mrs K being away I could not have Mrs O'C out here this time but invited her for another.—Busy times, lots of letters, have a visitor—cousin—coming to see me for a few days. Baxter had an article on you in Herald. I see by it you have the new ed. of L. of G. out, glad of it.W. S. K. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 25 February 1889"
