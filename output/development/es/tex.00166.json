    "text": "BostonSept 21st 1863.My dear sir,I have been much interested in a letter from you to Mr. Redpath, written some weeks ago, which I have lately seen, & I am very glad to send you the inclosed check to be used for the benefit of our noble \"boys\" in the hospitals, at your discretion. I have seen much of the hospitals myself, & I know how much good your friendly sympathy must do them, & also that even a slight pecuniary aid is sometimes very acceptable to them in their forlorn condition.Of the enclosed check, ten dollars of the amount is contributed by my sister, Mrs. G.W. Briggs of Salem, to whom I read your letter, & ten dollars by my friend Edward Atkinson. The balance I give to the boys with great pleasure, & I will very gladly give more hereafter, when I hear from you of the receipt of this & find that more is needed.As your letter is not of a very late date, I do not feel certain that your address may be the same as at the time you wrote. Please inform me how this is, as I hope to be able to send you more from other friends.I hope you will continue in your good work, as I am sure from your letter, & from what my friend, Mr. Emerson, says of his own acquaintance with you, that your visits must give great comfort to our poor suffering men.I am, with much regard,Very Truly Yours,L. B. RussellWalt Whitman Esq.Washington.Please address Dr. L. B. Russell 34 Mt. Vernon St.Boston. Dr. Le Baron Russell to Walt Whitman, 21 September 1863"
