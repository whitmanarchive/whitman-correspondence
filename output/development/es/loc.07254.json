    "text": "Superintendent's Office. ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,9 Oct 1888I have the \"November Boughs\" today with my name and yours on fly leaf. I lay this book by as one of my most precious possessions. I like the way it is got up and every thing about it and consider it altogether one of the most charming books I know. I shall keep it by me & look it through often (though I know about every line of it already). I note the two corrections (p. 37—An Evening Lull) and think the poem should have been left as it was. Last evening I went to Sarnia to see Pardee (back by noon today) he is much worse. Can speak only a few words and has difficulty in swallowing—I fear he cannot live many weeks.Your note (6 Oct) reached me last evening just before starting to Sarnia. When does McKay begin selling \"N.B.\" I should be anxious to here[hear] how the book goes. If this book does not go I shall think (as my father used to say) that \"the devil is in it\" for sure. Still occupied with Inspector—Annual Report shoved aside—but he goes tomorrow, thank the Lord. Then I get at A.R. and soon wind it up. Wm Gurd has seen that man in Detroit—he is greatly taken with the meter. Wants to take it up & manufacture but says it is no use thinking of manufacturing for the U.S. in one factory however largeI have been half the afternoon trying to add moments to scribble this letter—people running in & out—&c &cGoodly—more anonRM BuckeSee notes Oct. 12, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 October 1888"
