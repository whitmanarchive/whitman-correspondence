    "text": "431 Stevens st. / cor West. / Camden, / N. Jersey.Dec. 30, '75.In the New York Herald on January 2, 1876, \"Literary Chit-Chat\" announced the publication of the two-volume edition: \"His mind, however, is as brilliant as ever, and his spirits good. He is poor in purse, but not in actual want.\" Gilder was identified by Professor F. DeWolfe Miller.Forgive my not writing before. Much of the time, I cannot write, from paralysis. Very soon in 1876 I issue a small edition of my complete works in two volumes. Leaves of Grass will be one. The other, Two Rivulets, alternations of prose & verse—the themes ab't as diverse as they can be— poetry, politics, the war, &c—(I kept a diary from 1862 to '65, scenes in Virginia, Washington, &c. the hospitals, camps, battles, &c. here given almost verbatim.) I publish & shall sell the volumes myself, for two good reasons. No established publisher in the country will print my books, & during the last three years of my illness & helplessness every one of the three successive book agents I have had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds. If added evidence were needed to prove that \"Walt Whitman's Actual American Position,\" in the West Jersey Press on January 26, 1876, was written by the poet, this paragraph is significant when compared with the following in the Press: \"No established publishing house will yet print his books. Most of the stores will not even sell them. In fact, his works have never been really published at all. Worse still; for the past three years having left them in the charge of book agents in New York City, who, taking advantage of the author's illness and helplessness, have, three of them, one after another, successfully [and] thievishly embezzled every dollar of the proceeds!\" (Clifton Joseph Furness, Walt Whitman's Workshop (1928), 246). Walt Whitman referred to O'Kane, Butts, and Somerby. To sum up the situation at present: My health & strength are probably irrecoverable—still I may endure some years yet— mind unaffected—spirits good—Keep up about one third of the time, prostrated practically or wholly the other two thirds— Pecuniary matters thin & meagre, (but not in want)—shall probably reside steadily here in Camden. And now good bye, & happy New Year to you, my friend. Though this letter itself is not intended for publication, you are at liberty to use any or all the statements in it, should you have occasion—under your own judgment. Walt WhitmanOne of the first of the proof copies sent out at all shall be to you. A great part of Two Rivulets, prose & poetry, is fresh matter, hitherto unpublished. Letter from Walt Whitman to Jeannette L. Gilder, 30 December 1875"
