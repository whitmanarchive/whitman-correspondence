    "text": "BrooklynTuesday even'g July 5 1864 My dear friendI have had the misfortune to fall back a little since I wrote to you—I have had three or four pretty bad days & nights—but I am feeling decidedly brighter this afternoon, & have no doubt I shall be myself again before long. The trouble has been as before, bad spells of weakness with heavy aching head—I think the throat is no worse, but it is not well yet—William, I rec'd your letter to-day, also one from Charles Eldridge, with one in envelope—as to the future, & as to our meeting again, I have no doubt we shall meet again & have good times—if Nelly has not gone when this reaches you, I wish her to consider it just the same as if written to her—I do not write much, nor do any thing hardly, but keep as quiet as possible—my physician thinks that time, with the change of locality, & my own latent recuperative power, will make me well, but says my system is probably saturated with the virus of the hospitals &c which eludes ordinary treatment—&c &c &c—I have nothing new or interesting to write you. I intend to move heaven & earth to publish my \"Drum-Taps\" as soon as I am able to go around.So Eldridge is down at Petersburgh—if I were there at Washington & well I should want no better fun than accompanying them—When you see Count tell him I sent him my love—also Ashton—I will write should there be any change in my condition—Good bye for present, my dear friend, & God bless you—Walt Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 5 July 1864"
