The last one on May 31st but not hearing that they have reached you, have come to the conclusion that perhaps they have gone astray, and am sorry that I did not send them in the form of a check (which I will do in the future) I would be obliged if you would let me know, Have they come to hand? Also how your health isAnd Obey YouGM Williamson George M. Williamson to Walt Whitman, 7 June 1888"
