    "text": "Camp near Falmouth Va. Feb 6th/63Dear Walt.We have just received orders to cook three days rations and be ready to march immediately  I beleive[believe] the whole of the 9th Army Corps are ordered to report at Fortress Monroe. If so I suppose we will march to Aquia Creek, and go on board of Transports  My own oppinion is that Burnside is to collect a force at Fortress Monroe, and start off again on his own hook with a sepperate[separate] command. I wrote you a few days since, to send home for Mother to send you $20 by express and for you to bring it, when you came down here. Of course you will keep it, untill[until] we get to some place where you can either send it by express or bring it yourself. We will probaly[probably] stay somewhere around Fortress Monroe for some time, if so you can take a run down there and see me,  I will write you as soon as we get there. I have my house nearly finished, and was going to have a nice warm place. Capt Sims left here yesterday for home on a leave of absence for 10 days. I was going to apply as soon as he came back and was makeing[making] lots of reckoning of going home for a few days, but I suppose there will be no getting away now for some time.Walt, I have not received the letter you sent with the money, nor have I received any letter from you since the 27th of Jan. I wish you would write home telling them that we are going to leave here, as I dont[don't] know that I shall get a chance to write before we start. I will write to them as soon as we get to Fortress Monroe or wherever we may go. The mail is about closeing[closing] so I must stop. Good bye for the presentG.W.W. George Washington Whitman to Walt Whitman, 6 February 1863"
