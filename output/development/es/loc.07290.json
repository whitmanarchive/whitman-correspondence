    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,9 Jan 1889Worse and worse! Rained all last night and has rained pouring all day, still coming down as lively as ever. Country all mud and water. Nice kind of a Canadian Winter! I have yours of 7th this morning, yes, I should think Walsh not coming was a sure sign that he considers you better. Guess you will have to turn Ed. Wilkins out once a day for a good long walk (whenever you can best spare him) I judge from what you say that he is suffering from being too closely confined and from not having enough to do. If he cd get a cord of wood a day to saw (and would saw it) I would guarantee him against heartburn & all other indigestion. All quiet here—nothing new of any sort—what we want most is frost and snow and we shall not be right untill we get them. Dont forget to send me the lines you are printing in the Century as soon as convenient. The Boston Herald con'g Baxter's piece not here yet—I hope to get it this afternoon or in the morningAs always—love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 January 1889"
