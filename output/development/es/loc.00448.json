    "text": "St. Louis,August 20th 1868Dear Brother GeorgeI must beg pardon for my seeming delay abtabout sending the enclosed draft. But I have had so much bad luck lately in one thing and another that I could not do it soonerI have made the draft for $510—I wish you would give the $10 to Mother as a present from MattieMat is pretty bad yet—can just get around a little—very lame—but I think 'twill get away in a week or two if we have no more of the same sort—It pains me very much to see her try to walk—but she stands it like a good fellow—dont[don't] grumble a bit  I hope you have been occasioned no inconvenience by my failure to send you this on the 1st of the month  I meant to have done it but could not get matters into shape to do it till to-day—please write in regard to [receipt?] of this draft so that I may know that it came to hand safely  I believe I wrote to you or mother that Mr Lane would take the draft after you endorsed it and put it in his bank and draw the money for you—twill save you some trouble probably—We are quite anxious to hear from Mother and the rest of you—Mat has tried to write once or twice but does not succeed—she will make an effort to-day I believe—We are having the most delight[ful] weather here just now except that it is very dry indeed—yet we are having a little shower this morning. I hope it will be a good one for we need rain—we have great troub[le]s in carrying on our work the dirt is so dry—bad weather for building Reservoirs—How do matters go with you—is the 48 inch pipe all laid yet—I wish you would write me occasionaly[occasionally] and I often wonder why Mr Lane or McNamee does not write me—certainly they are in my debt for letters—I shall give em fits if I ever get on east again—The first time you are at Mr Lanes Office I wish you would ask Johny [M. McMear?] if he will see what taxes &c are due on that lot of mine on Flatbush Av and write me and I will send him a draft if he will pay it for me—or if he will give you the statement you can write me and I will send it to youI should judge from Mothers letter that she thought you would move—do you really think that you will abandon old 1194—You must keep me posted—Do you ever hear from Walt—I wish he would write me occasionaly[occasionally]—Love to Mother and all—affectionately yourBrother JeffNo of Draft 966 on Jay Cook & Co of N[ew] York Thomas Jefferson Whitman to George Washington Whitman, 20 August 1868"
