    "text": "Send 1875.Walt Whitman of this letter, I wish you to know that this what might fairly be called a backwoods country, and with no means naturally at hand to learn the etiquette of \"society\", I yet fully understand the nature of my acquaintance with you—it is a sort of \"literary\" acquaintance I would not fear into rec friend taken sheet of no throughout don't be gentlemanly to present one's self with some boldness in that way. The strongest of my motives all along has been to give you pleasure and be paying back for what I have received. Yet I have also thought of a good moral effect on my family from their seeing their nition from e in my of yet might insane or a drunk man then doubted whether you could admit the possibility of such conditions producing such sanely insane writing.(P.S. I know you must think there has been a \"level-headed\" theory to my life.)occasionally that you still live—for the Scripture says \"the dead know not anything, nor is there any more a reward for them &c &c. A mere Postal card can tell me that. But if you get tired of writing that sort of letters only, I will tell you what more to write of. First tell me of some of the things that make you happy, or at least all about your distressed condition. Dont[Don't] you thing about the Centennial expect of the John is it all the good things of and with you are you now only enduring life? Please forgive me if I be now impertinent—I have not been so in asking questions before, and I cant[can't] compel you to answer.Your card of July 2 acknowledged my letter of June 27, but didn't mention my letters of June 10 or 12—I like to know from me, in sound of what audience not to write questions , because while my original and unprompted ideas would necessarily in most cases be only a repetition of what others long ago, or t and civilization and mastering it\". Therefore I must not be in a hurry to commence on such things and be giving you my \"meagre\" thoughts.I think what will please you best, will be for me to write about myself, my circumstances, my practical philosophy, my mother, father, and others Yet I not ma B eccent so free me. My eccentricity lies in my adherence to all Nature and my own nature and following the straight path of good practical common sense in such a way as most people are not capable of. You and I, you and I \"fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul, and our of underst i wise fool for on in this way— am not at all or contentious and seldom have an enemy, there is yet in my nature (which I can't help) so much of the principle of destructiveness or mortal revenge that I am constantly upon me the fatal and very injurious provocation. Also (so much the worse for me) I have always had a leaning towards suicide as a relief in case of great trouble—Walt! can you require absolutely of me as a condition of friendship that I shall change the deepest grounded elements of my nature? \"Can the leopard change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin?\"I think you with natural philosopher, mar together 3 yrs. bined in would be quite a only 8—to a sort of patent of nobility here if I can judge rightly of appearances.—I have got along mighty well with my crop, and hindered the boys from school very little so far—they stand at the head of their classes—by divine right.Little Walt at the age of 7 months & 20 days commenced very suddenly to crawl over the floor in \"\" style ago— 18 1874— , and skinned) improve my this requires oft \"laying by\" the crop. What are most seem to be agreed that what America and the world need is to have not saints or angels but merely good enough people and allowing some difference in directions of action.J. N. J. John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, [8 February] 1875"
