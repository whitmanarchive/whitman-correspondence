    "text": "1015 O St. N. W.Washington, D. C.Nov. 29, 1889.Dear Walt,I have been too busy to even get time to say thank you, for your good letter, & the papers.All are welcome, but I was rejoiced at the good news in your letter to Dr. Bucke, & which he quotes in his. I echo his words. & hope that you are feeling pretty well this clear cold day.I am very glad you sent me the letter from Dr. Bucke, I will return it later. I have been trying to get the house into living order, & the stove is all right & burns well since it was repaired. The watercloset had to be seen by the plumbers, & they are slow, so it all takes time, but I am getting in order, & you know that I did not live in Philadelphia five years for nothing! I have a great love of good house keeping, care too much I fear, for the trifles.I hope that your boys are well, & your house-keeper. I was invited out to dine yesterday, Thanksgiving day. Last year I had William & Harold Channing, but I think we did not ask any guest, William was already so much of an invalid in some ways.With dear love, & all good wishes—As ever—Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 29 November 1889"
