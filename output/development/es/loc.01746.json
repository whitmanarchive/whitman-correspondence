    "text": "Camden,Friday afternoon Aug.August 1. 731873 or '4Dear son,Your letter is rec'd to-day, and enclosed I send you $20—I want you to write soon—as I shall want to know if it reached you safe. I am feeling relieved of the worst distress in the head, now for the last two days—had it straight along bad enough the first three days in the week—but yesterday & to-day it has mostly let up—have been out to-day, & over to Philadelphia—it is hard work, especially as I have no one to go with me—but I put a bold face on, & my best foot foremost—Is Wash Milburn there in the store? or has he gone on his vacation in the country?—answer me in your next—I think of writing a few lines to him—Hot weather here, but I don't suffer much from it—though I think it is bad for me, & I hope much more from the cool season, if I get through this—Pete I too see quite a good deal of Railroad, & hear more—some 70 rods off is the great depot of the Camden & Amboy, bells & whistles & trains rumbling continually, night & day, & lots of RR men living near, around here—if I only felt just a little better, I should get acquainted with many of the men, which I could very easily do if I would I should like much to go on the trips so handy & cheap, right as you might say from my door, to Cape May, or to Long Branch, &c. to say nothing of the numerous fine jaunts from Philadelphia by RR. or up or down the Delaware by steamboat——If you was only here to convoy me—but I suppose no one is to have every thing wanting—(Pete, dear son, there was $89 coming to you, of the money you put in my charge, & now there will be $69 yet due you from me—your own soap)—As I write, it is 4½ o'clock Friday afternoon—I am sitting here alone, in the 2d story front room—every thing quiet here—I rec'd the other letter, & Sunday Chronicle—when you write, tell me who you see, & every thing,—I like such letters far better than the formal ones some send me—I had a visit from a good, kind-hearted, rather queer old fellow named Ingram, from Philadelphia—he said he see in the Phil.Philadelphia paper I was laid up very sick in Camden—so he came over, & hunted for hours through the hot sun, found me at last—he evidently had thought I was keeled up, & hard up, & he came to offer help—he has been a great traveler, is English by birth—I found him good company, & was glad to see him—he has been twice—so you see there are good souls left——Pete when you see Judge Fisher tell him I shall yet be back all right one of these days, & in the mean time tell him I send him my love—also my love to Mr & Mrs. Nash the next time you go there—so good by for the present my darling son, & you must keep good heart, for I do, though it is pretty glum around & over me sometimesWalt.Pete you must read this over Sunday, as a ten minutes' talk like, about all sorts of odds & ends Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 1 August [1873]"
