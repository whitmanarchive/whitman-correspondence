    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,24 March 1889A warm (almost hot) day—sun shining like June—birds singing all about the grounds—have been for a short drive and am going again soon for another and to post this.I have looked up the Sarrazin article and I find (as expected) that Kennedy is quite right. S. says that \"Hegel is (according to W.W.) the greatest of the philosophers.\"I have been looking up the \"Encyclopédie\" question and I find it a bigger one than I expected. There have been many \"Encyclopédies\" pubd in France in the last 200 years and they are hard to untangle one from the other. However here are a few facts: 1, The great, celebrated, \"Encyc'.\" edited by Diderot was in 21 Vol. It was pubd from July 1751 to 1765. 2, The big \"Encyc.\" called \"Encyclopédie Méthodique ou par ordre de matiéres\" was edited by C.J. Panckoucke, then by H. Agasse, then by the widow of the latter and was published—first vol. in Nov. 1782—and the last in 1832 (just 50 years coming out). The text (letter press) of the book was in 166½ (I think 4to vols, and the plates in 51 parts, equal probably to 25½ vols—making 192 vols altogether. Your line (p. 120 \"N.B.\") to be correct ought to read say like this: \"While the many (or while the ? two hundred) quarto volumes of the great french Encyclopédie are being published at fits and intervals in Paris\" It is not quite correct to call the book the \"Encyclopédie Française\").We are all well, I am hearty, very glad to get home again after my run in the East—though I enjoyed my stay in Philadelphia immensely. I feel pretty confident I shall be East again in the course of the summer. I hope you will stick to the baths and a moderate rubbing with the hand or towel after each—and change your under clothes very often (two or three times a week) they need not be washed each time but hung up and aired—washing flannel so often soon spoils it and is unnecessaryGoodby dear WaltLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 March 1889"
