    "text": "CamdenSaturday 2pm May 28 '87Dear friendI send you the within just rec'd from Herbert G.—I have an idea that he will be on here Monday or Tuesday—If the spirit moves me & the weather is fine, I may come down Sunday, (before you get this)—but possibly not—so I tho'tthought I w'd send you the present screed—Showery & almost cool here the last two days. As I write, the sun is out, & my bird singing—I have had my dinner, mutton-stew, onions, & greens—(I used the vinegar you gave me on 'em—good—the bottle is most all gone, & I shall bring it down to be fill'd up)—I have not felt as well as usual the last three days— we had it hot & disagreeable enough here previous—Susan come up here & stay awhile & visit us—George too—Mrs. D would be glad too—Lord be easy with you both—Walt WhitmanAn old southern farmer John Newton Johnson has come up here from Alabama, 700 miles, to see me, & is here now. He is the queerest, wildest cutest mortal you ever saw has a boy 12 yrs old named Walt WhitmanHotel St. Stephen, European Plan, 46 to 52 East Eleventh Street, Between Broadway and University Place.W.D. Ryder, Proprietor. New York,May 27 1887 Dear Walt; I arrived here from the \"Germanic\" a few hours ago:—think that I shall stay here in the Germanic 4 or 5 days, not more, and then shall come on to Camden, where I want to lodge, if I can find a lodging. —simply, one decent clean bedroom will do for me. We had a squally disagreeable passage, notably so for the time of year. With love to you fromHerbert Harlakenden Gilchrist. Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 28 May 1887"
