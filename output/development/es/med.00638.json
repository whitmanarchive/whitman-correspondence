    "text": "February 1, 1881Yours rec'dreceived and very opportunely—all today has been the dismalest of this grim winter here, furious snow and wind howling, and I have not stirred out—the roads and rivers here all block'dblocked with snow and ice—the last week my physical system block'dblocked, too, with a chill and depression—right in the middle of the smoothest sailing I have had for years—but I feel that it will be a passing cloud (such indeed as comes to me every two or three months)—Yes I am quite tickled and favorable to coming there and am about sure I shall come, accepting your good invitation right out—Will write again this week—I have one or two newspaper bits about the Review article which I will send you; it has been extracted from considerable—the best thing is a letter from the Review editor, Allen Thorndike Rice, to me about a week after the piece appeared, one of the most eulogistic, solid acceptances of my theories possible—he paid me $100 for the piece and supplied me with a hundred pamphlet copies of it. I have rec'dreceived five or six letters from one and another, none of any acc'taccount. I saw Marvin some weeks ago. Eldridge is in Boston, in U.S. office. Dr. Bucke is writing his book.W.W. Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 1 February 1881"
