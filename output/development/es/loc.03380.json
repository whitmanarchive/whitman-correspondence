    "text": "Supreme Court Library Melbourne 29 / 9 / 90 My dear master Your kind letter of the 22nd & 23rd July, trebly welcome for its being a surprise, has come, and with it, I am gla, Dr Bucke's book (delayed, apparently, by the American P. O. authorities) We had been worrying the P.O. here for the previous month. It is 12 p.m. Ada and I have been arguing about your indication that the \"whole theory of the universe points unerringly\" to each individual in it, for she lost two lovers: before, we were saying goodbye to a member of our little literary circle, a nice young chap, a blacksmith thrown out of work here over the strike, and now going to a Ocean to help build a lighthouse. He will be away many months, and we feel now how we have liked him, I can tell you. (We didn't do much \"Date of Ethics\" tonight, I fear) Before sea, I met a young Welshman, named Davis, who told me he knew Ernest Rhys & then we talked of you. He says the Welsh like you, can't help liking you. He was delighted at your letter and then told me he was on the staff of the \"Age\" our principal people's newspaper & that he would see me again & have a yarn about you. I sent several extracts about you to the papers, but somehow can't get them in. I fear you are a little \"taboo\" yet. I send you an Argus of last week with a sample of the only kind of notice you get in the \"feudal\" circles. I wish I had something more cheering, but as they are constantly referring to you in a similar strain, your influence is clearly being felt. Ibsen is similarly treated by this paper. From my knowledge of the 'caste' that this paper pleads for, I take its remarks as favourable indications. Your complaints re the great journals refusing you a hearing pain all who know you but we console ourselves by the knowledge that the \"demons of our sires are the gods that we adore\". I read a paper on your attitude towards Democracy \"the Gospel of Democracy as promulgated by Walt Whitman\", before the Australian Church Literary Society on last Tuesday week. The reverend chairman was decidedly unsympathetic, but the tone of the debate was altogether in your favour. Level-headed, old men, and fiery young ones fought like paladins for you, and Walt carried the day. A reverend opponent was disarmed by being driven to own that he didn't believe in the brotherhood of man. The refreshing power with which one young man urged the audeince to read and absorb the Song of the Open Road and the vision with which another insisted on your being the \"great poet\", did our hearts good & made us wish you had heard them. . I was sorry the head of the church (Dr. Strong) was not there, for he really preaches your gospel, although perhaps he would not say so. I treated your \"Democracy\" analytically I Phsyically (a) Physiological aspect (b) Biological aspect (as a growing organisim) (c) SociologicallyII Intellectually with reference to (a) Science (b) Art (c) PoetryIII Spiritually. Re attitude towards (a) morality (its ethical aspect) (b) Soul (c) God Pervading, and intertwining with these, your great tones of Comradeship, Personality and nationality. In accordance with your wish, I give over the leaf of a list of the papers etc. that I have received from you Received from you, at Supreme Court Library Melbourne May 29th 1890 1. Letter2. Camden Daily Courier 2/6/83 \"About Walt Whitman\"3. A Backward Glance on my own Road4. Remembrance Copy (2)5. 2 Portraits full length (hat in hands). \"Sundowner\" we call it 1 \" with hat on1 \" side face, hat off1 \" W. W. 1855(6) Camden Post 22/4/90 \"W.W.'s Last Public\" August 23rd 1890 1. Letter2 Camden Post 2/6/90 Ingersoll's Speech3 Boston Transcript 19/4/90 \"W.W. Tuesday Night\" (two copies)4 What Lurks Behind Shakespeare's Historical Plays5. John Burrough's criticism on Drum Taps \"Galaxy\" 18666. Conservator July/90. \"Quaker Traits of W.W.\"7. \"Today\" June/85 \"Confession of Faith\" Anne Gilchrist (High-souled woman!)8. Price list of books. September 23rd 1890 1. Letter1. 3 \"Sturn\" portraits (hat on) 4 \"Sundowner\" portraits. Fred has one & Jim another (You would like them to have them)2. re Democratic Art3. Camden Morning News 15/8/90. Boyle O'Reilly4. \" Post 12/8/90. Paragraph re Emerson.5. Dr. Bucke's Book With such ammunition and provision in the shape of sundry editions of L of G. we ought to be fit to meet all opponents. If I can ever manage to get my hand in at literary work, I shall make sturdy attempts to do your yoeman service, at any rate. People don't take much notice of a poor clerk in an obscure library, I fear. I can only try to seek out those who can fight effectively. My canvassing for pecuniary powder & shot for you is not very successful as yet, partly owing to the canvasser & partly to the strike. The shearers and rouseabouts are striking now (Ted will be among them) and a commercial and industrial deadlock of ominous character is on. You shall get a 'glint' of it from the \"Argus\" (a little predjucided perhaps). I can see your influence in many of our Australian singers. One especially, Francis Adams, (whom a poet-chum of mine, Sydney Jephcott, holds greater than Shakespeare) wrote several years ago a great number of love poems of sickly sweetness: since then he has published a book called \"Songs of the Army of the Night\", simple, terse, sledge-hammer-like in which your influence is very apparent. They call him \"Whitman & water\" jokingly. He is in England now, making towards \"fame\". Mr Bury was \"up to the neck\" in labour matters, conferences with \"dockers\" etc. in England the last we heard of him. I do hope he will see you. You would be regular chums. He has been through so much here in Australia, has absorbed our Australian life so much more than anyone I know, and has withal so excellent a heart, so eclectic (in the broadest sense) a nature, that he will be a good type to you of what our democracy can flower to. His frequent daft quoting of obscure authors first showed me that respectability's or conventional hallmarks were not essential to great merit. I hope my 'ramblers' don't tire you. With many thanks for your kindness in sending the portraits, papers, and Dr. Bucke's \"Live\" Life (Fred & Jim are at it now, I go for a week's holiday to the wildest parts of our \"ranges\" tomorrow, and will try to get a suitable setting for fully enjoying it. W. O'Connor hasn't lost the Celtic blood over there, it is evident. One feels in an ancestral fair-scrimage while reading.) Fred & Jim and That his sister, Ada, Eve, Mr & Mrs Fryer all join in this our love-message, to our benefactor, our comrade and our bard. Blessings on you and heartily do we pray that your afflictions may be lightened and all your remaining days bright & happy. So LongBernard O'Dowd Eric Whitman O'Dowd sends his love too, for he smiles as we ask him & surely a parent's interpretation can be held the correct one. Bernard O'Dowd to Walt Whitman, 29 September 1890"
