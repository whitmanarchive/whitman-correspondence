    "text": "Plymouth Mich.Nov. 21st/64Kind Uncle & FriendYours came to me on Friday last much sooner than I expected Because my being so negligent of course I supposed you would act the same to meLast week I was sick so that the house was obliged to hold me very tight It is kind of a curious thing for me. I can not go out in to the open air with out taking coldPerhaps you will call at Armory Square when in Washington. I have been thinking about going there this winter to wile a way some of these lonesome daysMy Folks have some objections to my going where I have been so often for the last three years. But there is nothing like geting[getting] used to a thing or tooThe least stormy weather here drives us in to the house—But the rainyest[rainiest] night on Picket in Virginia we had to stand any how. Even a snow storme[storm] or too we have had here then I thought about being by the side of a snug fire all curdleed[curdled] up in a little heap half froze to deathA good warme bed a fellow gets at home besides other fixens[fixing’s] throwed[thrown] in. I hardly evr[ever] thought of these when I Enlisted & perhaps I may try the self same opperations[operations] again. This is a curious world to live & sport in There will be no Young ladies after this war closes.Because they are a fraid[afraid] some of the loved ones will come home crippled & they will Marry while they think about it Mostly of the Softer Sex will be old Maids waiting so long. I presume some of them are tiredYes I will tell her all about you one of these times & that before she is Married which wont be a great while. Well Uncle I hope this may find you still alive & wellMy best respects To you, My UncleRuben FarwellTo Walt WhitmanAdieu till next time Reuben Farwell to Walt Whitman, 21 November 1864"
