    "text": "1874 or '5431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N. Jersey,March 6. 74?Dear boy Pete,I was quite shocked to hear of Parker Milburn's death—he was never very rugged, but he kept up so well, & always had some cheerful, lively thought or saying—I was far from anticipating this—I think he had very noble traits, & both you & I liked him thoroughly—Pete, I hope he is better off—I will try to write a few words to Wash——Pete I have rec'd both your letters—I go out often in the Market st. cars past the West Philadelphia depot you speak of, but never get out or go in there, as it is a great depot, full of hurrying people, and hacks & drivers, & trains coming & going continually, & people rushing & crowding—too much excitement for me—So you saw Colein, in the Treasury—I saw him only a few minutes in a street car, but he could give you some report of me from his own eyes, & that I know satisfied you better—I am feeling quite an improvement, or let up, the last two days & nights on the bad spell I spoke of in my last letters—have slept better the last two nights. To-day as I write here, it is cloudy, & feels a little like snow coming—it has been very mild here too—Pete, go up some time when you start out early in the afternoon & see Mrs. O'Connor, 1015 O Street near 11th—she will be very glad to see you. I hope you won't fail to go. I am feeling quite comfortable to-day, as I write. Pete I sometimes think if I was fixed so that I had you with me every day, I should get well—good bye for this week, my loving son—from your oldWalt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 6 March [1874]"
