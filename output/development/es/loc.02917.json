    "text": "GLADSTONE-INGERSOLL FAITH OR AGNOSTICISM? Hugh B. Macculloch No. 30 East 14th Street, Cor. Union Square, S. W. New York June 15, 1888Dictated.Dear Sir:Col. Robt. G. Ingersoll will shortly contribute to THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW a brilliant article in defense of his views of Christianity, which were powerfully assailed by the Rt. Hon. Wm. E. Gladstone, in the May number of the Review. The controversy between these two most gifted writers and orators of modern times is chaining the attention of all classes of thinkers, and is recognized as the most stirring and memorable debate of the century. For a limited period the following offer is made by me to new subscribers to THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW: For a yearly subscription at $5.00 the REVIEW will be sent you, postage pre- paid, with a free copy of Mr. Allen Thorndike Rice's valuable \"Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln,\" a remarkable book by thirty-three remarkable men (see enclosed circular). The price of this highly successful book alone has never varied from $4.00. If you desire to follow the course of the Gladstone-Ingersoll controversy in the leading Review of the country, and avail yourself of this exceptional opportunity kindly send me your order on the accompanying card, and oblige, Yours respectfully, Hugh B. Macculloch Hugo B. Macculloch to Walt Whitman, 15 June 1888"
