I fear you are suffering a great deal. I have written to Osler urging him to try and do something to releive[relieve] that horrible irritation of the bladder that keeps you getting up so much at night and it seems to me imperative that the bowels should be kept open. I fear that Osler is too busy to give you the attention you require and it seems to me that you ought to have him recommend a good man who would see you every day, and twice a day if necessary while O. himself would come over from time to time and see you with him. I have also written to Traubel urging him to make some arrangement by which you will be seen at least once a day by some good doctorâ€”I wish I could be with you but that is impossible at present. I shall hope to hear very soon that proper arrangements have been made and that you are more comfortableI am alwaysaffectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 December 1888"
