    "text": "London5 ENDSLEIGH GARDENSN.W.1 Jan. /85.Dear Whitman, Some while ago I received your kind present of the 2 vols.volumes—Leaves of Grass & Specimen Days: recieved them, I am certain you will believe, with extreme pleasure, & with a grateful sense of your continuing to remember me across a somewhat long lapse of years. To be remembered by Walt Whitman is what any man shdshould be proud of, & none is so more than I. I have read the Specimen Days vol.volume right thro: finding various new things, & continual pleasure in reviewing my acquaintance with the old ones. Am extremely pleased to find in this copy of the book something wh.which is absent even from Mrs Gilchrist's copy—the photographs of your mother & father. If you were blessed with an unsurpassably good mother, I can with truth say the same of myself. My mother is still with us—aged nearly 85: health & faculties sound on the whole, but naturally bowed & stricken with the weight of years. I have also scanned with a good deal of attention (that of complete re-reading) my old & constant admiration, the Leaves of Grass vol.volume I observe that some edition (I think the Philadelphia edition is named, but my vol.volume is not under my hand at the moment for reference) is mentioned as the only final & complete form of Leaves of Grass. The vol.volume with wh.which you favoured me is not the Philadelphia edition, but I am in hopes that it may none the less be regarded as complete. I am glad to note in this country from time to time symptoms of the increasing appreciation of your works: especially something written by Ruskin, & the Sonata from the Lincoln Dirge. Accept as heretofore the affectionate respect & regard of Yours alwaysW M Rossettifrom Rossetti | Jan 1 '85see notes July 6 & 8 1888 William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 1 January 1885"
