    "text": "The bad spells in my head continued at short intervals all through Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Today there is a sulking sort of lull—have not had any actual blurs, but all the while ready to have them, and pretty sick and sore and bad, especially in head, confusing me, and affecting my eyes. I have rewritten my Will, with some slight changes and additions, and placed it in the pocket of my trunk here. … Ate my breakfast like a man this morning. I don't go out any. Have been reading Dr. Adam's speech before the Evangelical Alliance in today's \"Tribune.\" My eyes gave out before through. . . . Charley, I think I fully appreciate my situation and the possibilities and contingencies—and honestly think yet I shall come round—that this is a pretty bad flurry, but one which will pass over. . . . . . . We like the new house. Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 3 October [1873]"
