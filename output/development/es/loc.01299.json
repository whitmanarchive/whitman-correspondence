If 40 more could hold promise and deserving of such another, I should face them with both hope and patience.If this coveted but not-to-have-been-asked-for autograph means, as it seems to do, that the hand which wrote it is much stronger than when last I felt its generous touch, that token is alone enough to gladden this my little day.â€”Long life and all love!J.H. Clifford.see notes Aug 23, 1888 John Herbert Clifford to Walt Whitman, 21 August 1888"
