    "text": "Burlington Vermont.Feby 27, 1885.Bro Walt,Han grows stronger daily: relishes her food, and consumes as much as she used when well: Yet she has very bad spells, which she rather encourages: This however is constitutional, and for which, her good old deceased friend, Dr. S. P. Thayer, pronounced, irremedial[irremediable], by medicineâ€”Mr Heyde, he used to say, We know of no medicine that can cure it: still he always sympathised her, kindly, tenderly, and declared her to be, physicaly a perfect woman.She has omitted taking bromide, now, for 8 nights. If she could be persuade to desisted from rubbing a most pernicious coloring ointment, into her scalp, with an old tooth brush, her improvement would be greater. She denied the practice, but I have observed, from behind her chair, a complete scab allmost or the blood starting from the irritation:Christ, O! Christ! It makes me religious, and discouraged with women. Why gray hair is fashionable: and then cork screw curls, drawn over her forehead to cover wrinkles.C L H Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 27 February 1885"
