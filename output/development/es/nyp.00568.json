    "text": "Washington, D.C.May 23, 1883.Dear Walt:A couple of hours ago I got the copy of Dr. Bucke's book. I judge by a cursory and interrupted looking through, that it is tip-top.I hope it is to be bound, for I don't like paper covers. I noticed three typographical errors, which ought to be corrected. One on page 41, line 4, \"brilliant monogram\" for \"monograph.\" Another on page 74 (very bad) where my sturdy \"I vaunt it and I stand by it,\" is spoiled by being rendered \"I vaunt it and I stand by.\" On page 145, there is \"Thayer, Eldridge\" instead of \"Thayer & Eldridge.\"Success to the book!I will write to you later. I am much stricken. . . Since Jeannie's death, I have been very ill, and I am still ill and very feeble and broken down.Goodbye,Always affectionatelyW.D.O'CWalt Whitman William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 23 May 1883"
