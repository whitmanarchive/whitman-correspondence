    "text": "1015 O St. N. W.Washington D. C.June 30. 1890.Dear Walt,Thank you for the papers sent the other day. I sent you one yesterday, with various opinions on immortality. I Davidson says one of the strongest proofs is that we can't prove it!How comes on the preface to the stories? is it nearly done, or not begun, or how? or am I \"too previous\" in assuming that you are doing, or to do it? I only know what Dr. Bucke wrote me, as I have not heard from you on the subject at all. My plan is, & do you like it? My plan is to put the six published stories, & the new one, \"The Brazen Android\" in one volume,—with the sketch or preface, or whatever you may think best, & feel to do. Then you know that Appleton proposed to publish the \"Carpenter\" as an illustrated story for the next Christmas, & Dr. Bucke says the illustration must be a picture of you. I hope that the death of O. B. Burce has not changed the plan, he was the one who had it in hand. You know dear Walt, that they begin early to get up the books for Christmas, & I want to have the volume out early, & am having \"The Brazen Android\" put in type now, by a typewriter, as there was but just the one copy in the world; & I would not risk that in the mail. So, if you are in the mood, I shall be very glad of your part as early as you can let one have it, if I am to have it; which is for you to say. I have told you what a great help it will be to me in many ways, so shall not enlarge upon that now. I feel that you, & you only, are the one person in all the world to say the right thing about William O'Connor.If you have any suggestions to make about the volume I shall be very glad of them, for I feel that I am & have been very much working in the dark. If you feel like it, I should like you to confer with Horace Traubel, & see if he likes the plan of republishing in one volume.How are you these hot days? We have had it very hot, an old fashioned June.In some weeks I had two school girls with me, & we went out several times in the evening & took long horsecar rides; & it brought back to mind the old days when you & William, little Jeannie, Charles Eldridge & I used to go in the same way. I am alone again, but not for long, I think.I enjoyed the visit from Dr. Bucke much.I wish I could see you—with love ever—Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 30 June 1890"
