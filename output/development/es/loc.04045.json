    "text": "CamdenSunday afternoon Jan: 30—My dear friend,I rec'dreceived your good letter some days since, & would like indeed to be down with you & George & all—but the bitter cold continues so I think I'd better stay close here for the present—but it won't be long before I shall be with you all—I suppose you & the rest are reading Herbert's books from time to time—though they are very queer in the story of Blake's life and works, there is a deal that is interesting & good to chew on—then they are such beautiful specimens of paper & printing, it is a pleasure to read themI had a nice visit from Harry and Mont—there is nothing new or interesting to write you—it is now ½ past 2, after dinner, & I have been writing & fixing up a composition alone in my room, since breakfast—it is a cloudy, cold raw day here, rather lonesome, but still I make out—(but I could make out better if I have the rest of the day on a visit to Glendale, & a good strong cup of tea with you & Ruth, to cheer me up)—I am still feeling pretty well so far this winter, bless the Lord—I send Debbie a book \"the Old Curiosity Shop\"—love to her and Joe—have you had any more hog-killings—which is the most fun? them or the Glendale church?W W Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 30 January [1881]"
