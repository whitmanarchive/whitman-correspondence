    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,17 Feb 1890I was much pleased this morning to get yours of 15th and its enclosures, letter from Mrs Costelloe & card from Mrs O'C.' Glad enough to see that you are not materially worse though I fear no better and no more comfortable. Mrs Cs letter is most interesting—she seems to have gone neck and crop into politics. What a curious thing it is (and how fortunate) that whatever we take up with (maybe forced into it) soon becomes (usually at all events) intensely interesting to us. I guess Mr & Mrs Costelloe (and friends) are going to reform that old world over there! They will have a whack at it any way and perhaps the trying to reform it is as good as the actual reforming would be! I am scratching away here about as usual—the chief excitement at present is the question of ice, for next summer[.] We have had no winter & have no iceR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 February 1890"
