    "text": "see notes Aug 29 18881884. July 12.EDITORIAL DEPARTMENTTHE CENTURY MAGAZINEUNION SQUARE NEW YORKWalt Whitman, Esq.,My dear Sir: We are making preparations for a notable series of papers on the Battles of the War to be written by participants—general officers—including Grant, McClellan, Rosecrans, Beauregard, Longstreet & Joe Johnson & others. These we desire to supplement by short pithy papers on different phases of the war. At Mr. Gilder's request I write to ask if you would not write us a short, comprehensive paper on Hospital Nursing in Washington and on the field—something human and vivid. We should like about 4000 words. The object of the supplementary papers is to give the life, the spirit, the color of the war, which may be left out by the generals. Yours sincerely,R. U. Johnson N.B. Of course we should like the paper to cover different ground from what you have before written if possible—at least to cover it in a different way. Robert Underwood Johnson to Walt Whitman, 12 July 1884"
