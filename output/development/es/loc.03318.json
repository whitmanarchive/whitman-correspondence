    "text": "THE \"CAMELOT Series.\"WALTER SCOTT, PUBLISHER,24 Warwick Lane,London.FromERNEST RHYS.Sq Cheyne Walk,Chelsea.24th May 1887ToWalt WhitmanCamden, U.S.A.Dear Walt Whitman,I have this morning received your card of the 11th rec'd. Spec.Specimen Days in America makes its appearance in the London book-shops to-morrow, & before you get this I expect you will have a preliminary batch of six copies of the volume. I am writing to the publishers to-day to instruct them about sending the 50 more you want. The publishers seem to have made some mistake about the Preface & Addl note printed slips. I gave them distinct instructions about sending them, & I must just make them pay for their mistake by sending you further copies of the book to supply the omission. I enclose two cut-out leaves which they sent to me last week, with some vague idea of atonement, I suppose.Yesterday afternoon J. Addington Symonds called here unexpectedly when I had a pile of the SpecSpecimen Days Vols.volumes on the table, & he was delighted with the appearance, &c. of the book. I took him a copy on going to dine with him & Roden Noel in Eaton Square last night. I sent copies off to many other folk yesterday,â€”Mrs. Costelloe among the rest. She wrote me a nice little note about it, which arrived this morning. Gabriel Sarrazin, the young French critic, who is writing a study of L. of G., which he is tremendously taken with, shall have one to-day or to-morrow. I feel quite proud at being the agent & deputy of the book in this way. It gives me quite a new conception of my own importance in the world. I do hope you will like the general get-up of the book, & so on. If we have made any slips in this respect in the book, we can profit by them in the Democratic Vistas vol.volume the addladditional papers for which I look forward to receiving.I was glad to hear & read in the papers you sent of the brilliant success of the Lincoln Lecture. How I wish you could come over here & deliver it too; but I suppose that may not be. The gathering of the literaratiliterati in the audience was very significant. It shows a new departure, I think, on the scholastic literary side.By this time I expect Herbert Gilchrist is with you & has given you a general account of things over here. (Give him my hearty greetings!) By him I sent a batch of birthday wishes for the 31st, which I follow now with all imaginable devout orisons. In your coming year I earnestly hope you will have the great gratification of seeing a deeper & wider application of Leaves of Grass, pointing to a nearer consummation of their great idea than we have hitherto deemed possible! And, so, with deep love, I amErnest RhysTell Gilchrist not to forget about writing to me. Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 24 May 1887"
