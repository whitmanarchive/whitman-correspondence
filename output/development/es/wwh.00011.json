    "text": "WashingtonSaturday afternoon March 1, '73Dear Hattie,I have received your letter, & read it over & over again—it is very, very good—so much about your dear mother, it brought the tears to my eyes, & I had to stop many times—my dear, dear Sister Martha, she must have suffered so much, & to keep up such fortitude & patience & even cheerfulness, while life lasted—Hattie, I have just got a letter from your grandmother written Thursday afternoon, Feb. 27, & she had not got your letter then—did you send her one a week ago, as you spoke of having written to her? She was very uneasy at not hearing from Jeff or any of you, since your mother's death. I wish you to write immediately to your grandmother, direct to her care of Geo. Whitmanat Starr's foundryCamden, N. Jersey I have got just well enough to go out, in a carriage, but, dear Hattie, I am in a miserable condition, as to my power of moving—The doctor says I shall get well, but it is very, very slow and irksome—my mind is clear, but I have to sit in my room alone, by the fire, most of the time—visitors generally have been prohibited—but only a few come in—but now I have ventured out for a few minutes every fair day—It is now afternoon, very pleasant, & I shall just get out on the sidewalk & then back—O how often I have thought of my dear sister Martha, as I have been alone here, both night & day—I think of your father too, & of you & California—but here I am, unable to move—I hope Jeff will feel like writing to mother, & she will send it to me—As soon as I can travel I think of going on to Camden—Dearest Hattie, if we had a house to invite you and California to, how much comfort it would be to your grandmother & me—But I have great thoughts—at any rate a great desire—to get one, here, when I get well, & have grandmother & Eddy here—& then you & California shall surely come—Love to you, dearest Hattie—& love to your dear father, & to California—If you can, dear niece, write me again, & dontdon't wait very long, dear Hattie—Hattie dear, you must mind the address—(My letters from St. Louis are addressed wrong)—My right address is Walt WhitmanSolicitor's office Treasury,Washington, D. C. Walt Whitman to Mannahatta Whitman, 1 March 1873"
