If you have no better place to go, I shall be happy to give you shelter under my roof no 15, East Seventy-fourth St, where I think you spent an hour some years ago. In any event, I hope to hear your address, and to see you at my office. I am anxious to have one or more contributions from you for my Cyclopedia for which we pay ten dollars, per printed page. Will you suggest some that you would like to write? Prospectus enclosed.Very faithfully yours,Jas.
