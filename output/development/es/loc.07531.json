To-day I am feeling pretty fairly—Mr & Mrs Johnston, my N Y friends, call'd yesterday to see me—I had a letter from Buxton Forman (wh' I will send you—Horace has it now)—sends authentic the anecdote we heard ab't of Geo: Elliot & L of G—I have rec'd a letter f'm Wm O Connor—his eyes are troubling badly—but he wields spirit & determination same as ever—am drawing to a close my perusing history Louis Fourteenth—poor old creetur (as the old woman said to the Devil)—Every thing quiet here to-day.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 6 October 1888"
