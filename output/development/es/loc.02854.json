    "text": "ConcordApril 28, 1868.Walt Whitman:Your friendly note of the 26th has just come to hand, and yesterday your noble paper on Personalismâ€”for both of which attentions you have my thanks. I shall look for your views of the aboriginal literature, fully believing that your thought is on the track of Empire and sees the route to Personal Power for the nation, as for the individual. And never a people needed more the Cosmic thought to inspire and guide its action.Yet think of the progress out of the twilight since your star dawned upon our hazy horizon.Some friend has sent me from time to time appreciative notices of yourself, knowing by some supreme instinct my hope in whatever promises expansion for our hemisphere. You, too, kindly inform me of particulars about your personal position and prosperity. I am interested in all you choose to communicate.Emerson is just home from your city of steeples and stocks, but I have not spoken with him yet. I know how fully he shares in my appreciation of yourself and works.Please accept the sketch accompanying this, and obligeYours,A. Bronson Alcott. Amos Bronson Alcott to Walt Whitman, 28 April 1868"
