    "text": "Washington, Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 7, 1867. My dear Mr. Church,In response to your letter to William O'Connor, I send herewith the piece, \"A Carol of Harvest, for 1867,\" for the Galaxy. I presume it will be in time for the September number. I wish, if acceptable, you would have it set up immediately, proved, read carefully by copy, carefully corrected, & then a good proof taken & sent to me here. I would mail it back again the same day I get it, so you would receive it next day.If practicable, I should like to have the piece commence on an odd-numbered page of the magazineâ€”& wish it could come the second article in the Number.The \"Carol\" will make about five pages more or less.Please acknowledge the receipt of this. Direct to me, Attorney General's Office. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William C. Church, 7 August 1867"
