    "text": "BrooklynFeb 27/70Dear brother WaltAs you know I am in Brooklyn. I will not write about coming here. Jeff started back for St Louis this afternoon he was very sorry that he could not see you. but I am certainly coming on my way back. Davis is going to leave St Lâ€“ to build the W W of Lowell Mass. it is a very sudden move and made Jeff have to return sooner than he expected.I hear from Hattie every few days they get along nicely, and I think the trip will do me good I want to remain in Brooklyn till Davis comes on and then I will come to WashingtonWalter dont put yourself out too much to get me a room. you know I am not particular and for a few days anything will do. I want to see you very much and as that will be soon I wont write a long letter as I can talk so much better.from your sisterMattie Martha Whitman to Walt Whitman, 27 February 1870"
