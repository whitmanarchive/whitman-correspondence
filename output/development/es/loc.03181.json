    "text": "Feb 22. 1888Richmond - IndDear Walt;Last night was my first real attempt at the kind of splurge we have talked about. Bust & photo exhibition; clay modeling and talk. I came off at the Presbyterian Ch. before the Tuesday Club—I have met nowhere a more intelligent company. There were some 200 present. I began by a ten minute reading as a sort of \"prayer\" or prelude, & then turned to my clay & modeled & talked for a half or three quarters of an hour, producing a tolerably good head of old John Brown. I was able to keep up a continuous interest. Then I explained casting in plaster, & the reproduction in marble. Then I drew some chalk pictures on blackboard, & gave some reminiscinces of Emerson, yourself & Dr. Holmes. I had your photos there—& many others, with my busts of Hicks, Sumner, Emerson, & my little head of mother—We kept up the business till near ten o'clock. I guess it was a success. At all events, the thanks were profuse and hearty. Several ministers were there & in perfectly good humor. I now feel sure I can make this sort of thing all over the country. But I want to reduce the bust exhibition business to a magic lantern performance. It will not be so picturesque, but more convenient, & much less expensive. It would cost like sin to tote several large busts about the country. I wish I had photos of my big busts of you & of the statuette, negatives small size fit for stereopticon. I must have them some way. Next Sunday's Register will print my opening remarks & give a account of the evening I shall send you a copy.I am worried about Harned. Horace just wrote me a word & sent the Posts two weeks ago, & that's all I've heard. I hope the affair has not been serious.And I hope you are comfortable. I should like to stop in & see you all. I'm trying to get the Hicks bust plastered before sending. Will send it by 1st of next week. I rather wanted to make the most of it here, & so have delayed. What about the lecture for the Fidelity?Kind regards to Mrs. D. Let her read this &Yours ever,Morse Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, 22 February 1888"
