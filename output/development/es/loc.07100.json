Andrews.Office ofThe Boston Herald,Boston, Mass.,June 21,1887My dear friend:Yours of the 18th received, and in response I enclose a check for $373. I hope to be able to send more in a few days by calling in the amounts already subscribed as speedily as the pressure of my journalistic work will permit. Had I more time it might progress somewhat faster, but I regard it a privilege to be able to do what I can, and I only wish more energetic hands and a more eloquent tongue might be in charge.Faithfully yoursSylvester BaxterP.S.â€”We all want you to suit yourself thoroughly in the matter and we hope you will soon find yourself domiciled amid surroundings after your own heart.I have had a call from a bright young German-Japanese, your friend Hartmann, who is on his way back to Philadelphia from Europe. It is satisfying to see your friends numbered among such diverse races.Faithfully yoursSylvester Baxter Sylvester Baxter to Walt Whitman, 21 June 1887"
