    "text": "Feb. 12. 1889.Dear Walt,If things go on as they have for the past week, you will have to think yourself lucky if you get even a postal in ten days. You must remember that I am housekeeper, nurse, marketer, & have to see that the house is decent, if possible, besides being interrupted at every ten minutes to answer some one who calls from a good motive to ask how Wm. is, but would do better not to come often.So far I am the only nurse, & if you have been as badly off as he is, you may have some idea of what it means, in this case it means that I wash & dress him so far as he can be dressed,—wash his urinals, for he has to be protected night & day, from the constant dripping,— & to keep him at all clean is nearly impossible. Some nights I get not more than four hours sleep & that very broken, & some days not one moment to rest at all. To-day I am nearly blind from loss of sleep. We have some very bad nights since the attack four weeks ago, & one of the very bad and troublesome developments is the nausea and throwing up, so you see that I am not very idle, & I some days could not write a postal card to save you. You will ask why we don't have a nurse? the answer is William does not want one, & is not ready yet, sends love to you & says tell you he would write if he could.Good by.As ever —Nelly O'Connor.I have had to leave this letter six times to do some thing else. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 12 February 1889"
