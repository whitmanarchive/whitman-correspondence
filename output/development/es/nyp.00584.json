Days, & a letter—please notify me if they both come safely—I don't think of any thing I want to add to the suggestions in the letter—If any thing further occurs to me, I will write to you—It strikes me that from a business & publisher's point of view your folks w'd do well to have the three volumes viz: L of G as you already have it & then the two prose books \"Spec: Days\" & \"Democratic Vistas\"—W W Walt Whitman to Ernest Rhys, 3 February 1887"
