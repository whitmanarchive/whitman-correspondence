    "text": "Aug 20 '84 Sent Rolleston | 28 Terrassen Ufer Dresden Saxony.Two or three little matters I will write to you about. How is the publication of the German version getting on? My guess would be that when fairly afloat it might have quite as much sale here in the United States as in Germany—perhaps more. Would of course require a little while to get bruited about—but then I think quite probable a steady demand would set in. Two or three central book jobbing houses should be fixed upon, one in New York, one in Chicago, & one in San Francisco—With an eye to this I would like early copies sent to Wm Sloane Kennedy, Belmont, Mass:J L & J B Gilder, Critic office, 18 Astor Place New York CityProf. Edward Dowden, Temple Road Winstead Rathmine's, Dublin IrelandTalcott Williams, Daily Press cor 7th & Chestnut Sts PhilaEditors, Daily Republican newspaper Springfield MassDr Karl Knortz cor Morris av and 155th st New YorkR W Gilder Century Magazine, Union Sq N Y All the above would quite certainly announce and review the German trans. Walt Whitman to Thomas W. H. Rolleston, [20 August 1884]"
