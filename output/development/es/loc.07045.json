Health pretty fair the last four months, & would be so still, except for an increasing prostration of the whole muscular system, connected somehow with a head derangement,—almost a falling sickness, as at times I cannot keep my legs. Mental arrangements go on untouched—am busy at a preface, prose of course, to completed L of G.—to an edition same plates as the 1881–2 one—have scribbled one or two reminiscences (life sketches of notable men) which I will send you when printed— May be necessary for me to give the German publisher a formal copyright waiver and warrantee[warranty], which I will do. I am sole owner and controler[controller] of all L of G copyrights here. Soon as you begin print—send me specimen proofs of some of the pages— Walt Whitman to Thomas W. H. Rolleston, [?] [?] 1885?"
