    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,18th March 1883My dear WaltI return you today the proof in pages I have considered it all very carefully and am quite settled as to the rearrangement of pages, pictures &c. please leave them as I have put them—I have not made much change—the burial scenes must face different pages as they will only be known as described in \"List of Illustrations\" by that fact—It would not do to print on back of photo-intaglio so I have added a leaf—the photo-intaglio will face title page—the birth-house will face opening of chap I (p. 13)—the \"remote\" and \"immediate\" \"ancestry\" pages I have moved as you will see—Van Velsor burial hill picture will face p. 15, and W. burial hill picture p. 17—Portrait of father will face p. 26 (mention of his death)—every thing else is left as you put it. I want portrait of Mother to face mention of her death (towards end of chap I)—then the photograph or phototype of W. W. in 1880 might face the opening of chap ii (W. W. in 1880)—and fac-simile of writing should face page in that chap. where handwriting is mentioned. You told me McKay could get the pictures printed in Phila at $1.80 or $2 p.m. have a letter from McK. in which he says Sherman & Co would charge me $20. p.m. for three, however, no matter, they are ordered at De Vinnes N.Y. and will be done immediately. I like all your emendations, additions, &c so far (on the whole) very much, & can see that you are materially improving the book, for whwhich I feel very grateful—But dear Walt be very careful like a good fellow with chap iii of part ii—whatever you dodont[don't] slash it up if you make material changes send me the M.S. with proofs that I may see exactly what they are and consider them—don't fail me in this—that chap is the pivot on which the Book turnsR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 18 March 1883"
