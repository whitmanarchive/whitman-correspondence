    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamdenNov. 18 '84Dear friendYours of yesterday just rec'd—with the $25—(making 150 in all)—best thanks—So you like the Brignoli bit—I was not sure it amounted to much, but it came from the heart—(it was first sent to the Tribune to be published the morning of B's funeral, but the T sent it back)—How are you all? How is Al, under the new dispensation? I send my love specially to Alma and the girls & the new Mrs J—Nothing very new with me—I am ab't as well as usual except an increasing lameness—Anticipate a time not remote when I shall be unable to walk at all—Have not forgotten the Memorandum History of the Portrait—have already outlined & partly prepared it—you shall have it soon—I am writing this up in my big den—the floor all around horribly litter-rary, but a cheery wood fire in the little stove—& I comfortable in my great capacious rattan arm-chair—(which I may will to Al, if he cares for it)—W W Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 18 November 1884"
