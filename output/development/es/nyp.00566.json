    "text": "Camden New JerseyJuly 26 '87Dear friendThank you for the kind postal card—Does Wm care ab't having papers (Critic, Boston Trans: &c) sent—& is he mostly at the house in O street—or to be address'd at the office? I think every day about him, & am almost feverishly anxious to do something—Would like at the least to send papers & letters to while away the time—but fear being intrusive with them—I am living here in a little wooden house of my own, with a kind Jersey woman (a sailor's widow Mrs: Davis) for housekeeper & cook—am totally bodily disabled as to locomotion &c.—but good heart—& eating, digestion, sleep-power &c. fairly active—I am sitting here in a big arm chair by the open window as I write—hot weather here too for eight weeks—but I have stood it—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 26 July 1887"
