    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,7 Aug 1888I have yours of 4th You put a good face on it but according to Traubel you had a bad day Saturday, I hope you are feeling a little better by now. Thank you very much for the proofs pp.105–117 the little bundle came this morning. I guess it is hot with you, warm here, not however out of the way and the nights cool. I hope poor Stedman will have a good time getting that calendar pubdpublished!—Mrs Bucke is still in Detroit I guess she finds it warm enough there. Be sure and bear me in mind in re the etching. Willy Gurd has finished the meter! Five solid years' work. I had about given up the notion that he ever wdwould be done. All to do now to put on a few finishing touches—he will be here next week the whole thing accomplished—next thing is to see about its practical utility & value and how to turn it into cash. It ought to be worth a lot of money—we shall see—it is quite possible. I shall have to go East about this business in the course of a month or six weeks—in which case I shall of course see you. We are all well and on the whole are having a pleasant summer. I am glad you are getting cheerful letters from O'Connor I think he's not sufferring so much these times, am a little sorry he is worrying himself about the cryptogram which I hear is more or less of a fraud though perhaps not intentionally so on Donnelly's part—Your friendRM BuckeSee notes Aug 9, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 7 August 1888"
