    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,9thSeptSeptember1883Dear WaltI have your card of Aug.August 30. Yes, all right—I am satisfied with \"Walt Whitman\" except that it does not express one tenth what it ought to do justice to the subject, but I believe it is the best I can do after all and so it must go—as for the paying part of the business I am quite easy abt.about that—I think it will pay in the long run and if it does not I am equally satisfied except that I would like it to have some circulation on the chance of its doing some good. Yes, I saw the Santa Fé letter too (thanks for it), and I also saw the N.Y.New York Times of Aug.August 8th on it—did you see it? was it not shamefull[shameful]? The man glories in his want of sympathy, and laughs consumedly that any one else should have any. I saw Tommy Nicholson down town yesterday and he showed me your letter to him. I was well pleased to see that you really have some notion of paying us another visit—I hope to see you next month and then perhaps we can arrange something—perhaps you will return with me, who knows, there may be luck in store for me yet! And you think of \"breaking up where you are living\"? But you must tell me all about it when I see you, please goodness that will be soon—but I cannot tell yet when I can get away East, there are many things to do first and a great deal to think of—will let you know all about it when I know myself—Goodly dear WaltYour friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 September 1883"
