The Paris (France) Revue Independent magazine November has a notice L of G.—also something in a Palermo (Italy) paper—Dr B has them—No word now for quite a while from my dear O'Connor—I am very uneasy ab't him—I have (did I tell you?) a good strong willing nurse, & good doctoring watch—I send my love & memories to Mrs: F., to Baxter, to Garland, to yourself, dear friend, & wife—& to Sanborn if you see him—I must now get to the bed—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 18 December 1888"
