Very sorry to hear such bad accounts of the cold but trust it will soon be better, [/] wish you could have a good alcohol bath, real good sweat, would help you very much—can you not get some one in Camden to help you to arrange an alcohol bath—it is extremely simple. Willy Gurd still here, he goes East tomorrow morning, has the gas meter all constructed (\"in his minds eye\") already, will soon put it together when he gets alongside his lathe—all well here and nothing new. Ground still quite white with snowAffectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 April 1889"
