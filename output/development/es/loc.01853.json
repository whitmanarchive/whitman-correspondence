    "text": "Meltonsville, Alabama,Tuesday noon May 7/76Walt Whitman—This not so much if at all an exposure of anything facts, thoughts, perhaps idle with a lot of to take up. to put list—lessness to be better all. Charity, not for you, but for myself, is the motive, as this is (forenoon of Monday, May 8,) a day when the fields are too much soaked with rain for out-door farming business, and the man is lonesome. (Now, if there were living near me, such people that I could take my Walt Whitman books with me, and by reading to them, or having them read for themselves, rather jump up and shout \"glory, glory, hallelujah\" like the good follks[folks] do it pass the day well. But it is so much different I am a poor, —as for styling myself \"philosopher,\" I that, and let you see you have guessed well if you have taken interest in the matter enough to be guessing—it is not a term ever applied by others to me, and has very seldom been used by me, 'till[until] writing to you—a nom de plume—sometimes when I am talking to myself I use the title—also some years ago when I saw in a newspaper mention of a character (perhaps), a \"J.N. the Philosopher\" I thought it might be some one's mischief concerning myself on account of drastic manner in conversations ality of ways and mysh to se they might fall into wrong hands, and being so frank or communicative—you see—Possibly, possibly, you will like to know how I like it does me great good to see the full —a very proper most convincing open has open eccentricity, but for comfort, very nice )—the intercalations are good—I judge the new issue was printed from old plates still in your possession (printing and mis-printing all the same). How much would it cost to print for me about 6 copies of the full-length picture?When the two books came to the post-office, I read to the P.M., an old man of large body, brain, and general solidity, and a consistent Union man, the \"Song of the Banner at Day-Break\"—it seemed to please him powerfully.I tell you fear not! \"the Philosopher\" is a fine reader—voice a little husky and nasal at times, and teeth awful bad, but the whole to bring forth what lies slumbering is further back than lips or teeth. If I were a rich man I would print in great big big type, that Song, for wide distribution at the Centennial, and if you pestered me about infringement of copy-right, I would pull your beard.In \"Two Rivulets\" I see nothing but what is good.The Passage to India and the Strong Bird &c were not new to me—I had them before. Democratic Vistas was new—thinking of lending the book among the most suitable people around me (people perhaps too poor to buy for themselves I have marked about as condensed expression of ebol a good deal in other places—your books tho'though are bad books for marking—so many marks to make, the object is defected. I dontdon't want my your books but I like to lend them —sending out to come into the fact of the Not being a have been any enthusiast about flags of any sort, or disposed to pronounce any (either) cause certainly just or holy, but I much admire all your \"Flag and Union and Soldier and Hospital writings—I wouldntwouldn't give 10 cents for life-size paintings of Grant, Sherman, Lee, Johnston, Davis and infinituresI wish you would sometime take up Democratic Vistas (for me)and read (Conscience) Page 62 and then bottom of Page 69—please read all of it (for me). All of Dem Vistas.Concerning that Exposition, and people coming or not coming to it, I see that I can get (or have) the means to come and pay my own way, first and last. As a matter of policy, here is considerations. A man with a large family, in resolving to spend, ought to think not merely of his principal, but of his income; think of the easiness, or the difficulty and slowness of replacing what he may spend. The principle of self-denial and paternal solicitude says for me to consider what good can I make it do my family if I make that visit to Phila.Philadelphia?Under some circumstances it may do much good—they they wish me to do so—I might please them a great deal by this relation of what I should see— nd the instruct them, give all a taste for reading, and in time \"elevated sentiments\". Of course the crowding, and and multitude of sights and sounds would a wild man very much, and a distinct remembrance of any ponderable part. kept and freely I know under favorable conditions the chance to see and talk with (just, lone, solitary) Walt Whitman would be half of my pleasure. And again, if I could write, speak, act, or look so as to win any considerable bit of kind notice, or useful suggestions from you, I know it would afford a great pleasure certainly, and perhaps be a valuable moral stimulant and elevator to the family. Put this against the outlay. I wish to find the best book for them, and to inspire them with pride, that they may be worthy wise and children of of a home made her.All stubbornly at my own expense. As I write this, I am to come there. I swear I wontwon't if you say I shall not see you,But if I could come at my convenient time, and hire lodging close to Walt, and step in for a week at your convenient times, and beard the (reticent) lion in his den, and make him give me a great deal of information and good advice, it might pay us here finely.As I have exhausted my sheet, I forbear giving news of the situation with us tilluntil such is called for.I guess having John Newton Johnson to Walt Whitman, 7 May 1876"
