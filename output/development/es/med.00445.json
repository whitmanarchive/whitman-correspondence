    "text": "431 Stevens st Camden N Jersey May 5 p mDear friend,Nothing very notable to write about, but I thought I would send you a line—This is one of my comfortable days—good night's sleep last night—breakfast & dinner to-day with appetite—still get out a little most every day as formerly—my book business, & a little writing & reading give me three hours or so occupation (lazily) every day when I am not too ill—and then the baby, my brother's 6 mo's infant boy, very fine & bright (of course) is an unfailing delight & diversion to me—the young one knows me so well, & is never so happy as when I am tending him. I adopted your suggestion of 3 or 4 weeks since—wrote with result as follows to Wm Swinton—no answerto E C Stedman, sent an order at once enc'g: $30to J Q A Ward, kind answer, will order presentlyto Dr Seeger, answer, order 1 set, & money enc.to Joaquin Miller, ordered a set & sent the money.to Mr. Jardine, answered a few days ago I did not write either to G. A. Townsend, or to W C Church —have not sent the [incomplete] Walt Whitman to John Swinton, 5 May [1876]"
