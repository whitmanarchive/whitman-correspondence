    "text": "Anderton, near Chorley.Lancashire, England10. Feb 1891My dear Walt Whitman,Just a few lines in acknowledgment of your very kind and affectionate post card of Jan: 27th addressed to Dr Johnston & received yesterday.It's[Its] most important sentence, to us, is that referring to yourself. (I continue rather poorly. End uncertain)And we shall be very anxious indeed till we hear further & better news. I do hope that you are better by this time, & am looking forward to the receipt of a message from Traubel.I got today a copy of this month's \"Magazine of Art\", which I will send on to you with this. It contains some additional & later portraitsof Ruskin, which will perhaps interest you. But the writer has to end by saying that Ruskin's \"portrait—his true portrait—does not exist. It could not exist.\"I wish I could send you something more but must content myself, for the present, with saying that our loving sympathy & best wishes are with you always.Yours affectionatelyJ.W. Wallace James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 10 February 1891"
