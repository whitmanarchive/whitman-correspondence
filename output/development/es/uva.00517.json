    "text": "MildenhallSuffolk9 June '86Dear WaltI have your card of 25 May—Last week Carpenter came to town and I spent a day with him at Alfred Withers' (do you recollect him at London) in Hyde Park &c. We had a good talk and dinner together down town—Then last Sunday I spent most of the day and dined at Herbert Gilchrists and Carpenter was there. I am now making a few short visits in the country, shall return to London 21 and sail 30th—expect to see you about 15, 16 or 17 July and want you to be ready to go to Canada with me so as to avoid the heat of August and September in Camden—you may go home again as soon as you like after 1 oct. but I must insist on your going with me for the two hot months—Now please do not think of refusing to go but make all necessary arrangements and we will move Northward as soon as convenient after I get across the water—My health has improved quite a good deal and I trust it will keep on the same tackI am dear WaltAffectionately YoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 June 1886"
