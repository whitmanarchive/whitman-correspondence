    "text": "12 Well Road, Hampstead, London, England.17th February. 1888. Friday morning.Dear Walt;It is a long time since I have heard from you or word of you: though I have had one short note from Ernest Rhys, it is true, who spoke of you; & of your being somewhat under the weather.We all liked your brief letter about the President—& our Friend—Mr. Forman spoke of it the other evening as \"very nice.\"It seemed to me to eminateemanate from someone who felt pretty brisk.You find E. Rhys a good fellow—I am heartily glad he is getting on so well in the States—at least he seems to be entering into the fun of a winter there.Last Friday evening I created a chalk & charcoal portrait of Buxton Forman: he was delightful with it & so was his wife, for whom it was a birthday present. He has a good characteristic head and I enjoyed making it very much.Once a week H.B. Forman is Clerk-in-Waiting at the General Post Office & on those evenings in comfortable office lit with electric light I made the portrait.I am in the evening now planning out this large reception w 33 friends to see your portrait, that I spoke of in my last letter.If any names & addresses of friends occur to you, that you would like me to ask, send them in your next. I have already got a good many of your friends' addresses but the last batch of subscribers through the Pall Mall Gazette I have not got. Mrs. Rosamund Powell (a friend of L. Morgan Brown's) sends (£3) through me in this letter her annual subscription (free will offering) to you. Let me know if you get this all-right?Give my kind rememberances to Morse, when you are writing, I expect to show his bust along with my others works at this reception in April.Carpenter is well.Mont S. has been very ill as you must have heard.With kind loveHerbert GilchristPS. I am going to Lincoln tomorrow morning to paint a portrait.H Gilchrist Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 17 February 1888"
