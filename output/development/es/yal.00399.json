About Piper's bill you can wait till you go personally to Boston.I have written to O'Kane to–day, & I hope you will have no further difficulty in getting the books—I have requested him to send word to you to come & get them. If we get started in the way we talked of, (& I have no doubt we shall,) & satisfaction is felt on both sides, it is certainly my intention that you shall have actual & complete control of the sales—& all supplies. Walt Whitman to Asa K. Butts & Company, 29 December 1873"
