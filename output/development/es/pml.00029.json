    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. July 16, 1869Dear Abby,Every thing here goes on pretty much the same with me. My health has been good since I last saw you. It is very monotonous here, & I sometimes feel like pulling up stakes in desperation—Abby, I have little to write about, only I wanted to write you something—I hear from you occasionally by mother's letters—What a good girl Helen is, to go and make those nice calls on mother—I am grateful to her for so doing, & hope she will continue always—the same good affectionate Helen—& indeed I am sure she always will be—It is very hot weather here—to-day it is 96 or '7—I am sitting here at my desk in the office—there is quite a breeze pouring in the window, but it is a warm wind—half our clerks are away on vacation. I shall leave Washington soon after the middle of August—then I will see you all, & we will have some good talks. Good bye, dear Abby—I send my love to Emily, & all—The O'Connors are well—Jenny grows like every thing. AffectionatelyWalt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 16 July 1869"
