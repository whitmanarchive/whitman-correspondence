And as this is Christmas night and I alone in my Shanty will improve it in writing You althouth[although] there is not much new to write Yet I will make the Endeavor. I have been away all day as this is a day that all Niggers Should be free. and haveing[having] an invitiation[invitation] out to Eat roast Turkey of course excepted it and had a verry[very] nice time yet I think had I been in New York or Brooklyn that I would enjoyed My-Self much better and Shall be glad to get back there once more as a citizen for to go there on a leave of absence is only an agrivation[aggravation] as the time is always So Short that one cannot heardly[hardly] turn before he has to come backI Suppose that you have heard that we have a new Colonel Commissioned in our regt. who is none other than Capt. McKiben Bronets Brig. Genl. And I heard that there had been a Commisson[Commission] issued as Lt. Col. to Some out Sider, I don't know how true it is, Yet I think it is a Shame to run over all of our Officers that are now Priosners[Prisoners] of War Who have Served and fought in the regiment Since the Orginization[Organization] and for my part I Shall resign if what I hear is true. So You need not be Surprised if You hear that Your humble Servant has put in his Unconditional Surrender, and retires to Private lifeWe have Sent Your Brother Georges large Trunk home to Your Mothers Address by Express So if you have not already received it You Can look out for itHopeing[Hoping] to hear from you SoonI remainYours &cWE Babcock 1st Lieut Comdr Co 51st NYV William E.
