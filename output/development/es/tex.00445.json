    "text": "5 Endsleigh Gardens,25 August 1885Dear Whitman,You will believe that I received with pride and warm feeling the love which you sent me in a letter to Gilchrist, now published in the Athenaeum; and that I reciprocate your love with reverential affection.That movement for a few English people to express in a practical form the feeling which they entertain towards you has not as yet taken any extended development—nothing I believe having been done outside a few general paragraphs in journals. Gilchrist will now be taking steps in a more detailed and direct way: from him and his mother you will no doubt hear many particulars from time to time.The sums which have as yet come into my hands as Treasurer are £22.2.6. I beg to forward this amount in the within form—being 1. 3 Post-Office orders which will be made good to you upon your signing them, and presenting them at Camden—and2. A Brank-draft which, as I am advised, you can get cashed in Camden or Philadelphia. The draft comes from Charles Aldrich, of Webster City, Iowa, who had an interview with you some months ago, and wrote me several interesting details about it. Indeed Mr. Aldrich's letter was the immediate incentive and opportunity for Mrs. Gilchrist and the rest of us to bestir ourselves, and see who among us would honour himself by associating his name in this small way with yours.I enclose a little list of names, and remain, like so many others who have hearts to feel and ears to hear,Your lifelong debtor,W. M. Rossetti William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 25 August 1885"
