    "text": "510 Madison StDec 30th/87Dear Mr WhitmanMany years have rolled by since I last shook hands with you on Fulton stStreet Brooklyn. I can see you now as you looked then tall and hearty—in a grey woolen shirt, turned down collar—bare bronzed neck—bearded face crowned with a soft broad brimmed slouched hat—a supple active form holding a heart wide awake for whatever might betide sunshine or storm!—In those days I scribbled sometimes for the Eagle over which you presided. I loved to work what good I could for the Sunday School of Old St Ann's for its missions and our City's poor—you were always ready to aid in such good work—I was young then, and light hearted—I am a Widow now with a son 27, and two daughters younger, Edith and Anna; Anna has been two years a student of Ellocution[elocution] with Gabriel Harrison, whom doubtless you will remember she has been invited to recite at an entertainment given by \"Winchester Post,\" at their annual installation of officers Jan. 5thShe will recite the first time for her your poem \"The dirge of the two Veterans\" musical accompaniment by F Ritter, she will be accompanied on the Organ by Professor Raphael Navarro an old Brooklynite.She is now in the parlor rehearsing the piece with her sister. Ah dear old friend as I hear from her young lips those soul stirring words of yours my heart strings thrill—the last years are back again fresh and green and I feel old things are best. I hear again the clear ring of your voice, and feel the warm clasp of your true hand.I feel ere the shadows of Evening close around, as if, I must write to you, if only, to say God Bless you, and your dear ones,—and give to you and them a happy most happy New Year.My children join me in love and good wishes.Sincerely yoursMrs Anna M KerrP.S. \"The dirge of the two Veterans is the title. Anna M. Kerr to Walt Whitman, 30 December 1887"
