    "text": "The motto that you send for the title-page would do extremely well—meantime I had picked out one from Lucretius as follows: Quae cum magna modis multis miranda videturgentibus humanis regio visendaque fertur,rebus opima bonis, multa munita virum vi,nil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius in senec sanctum magis et mirum carumque videtur.carmina quin etiam divini pectoris eiusvociferantur et exponunt praeclara repertaut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus. which being interpreted is: Now though this great country is seen to deserve in many ways the wonder of mankind and is held to be well worth visiting, rich in all good things, guarded by large force of men, yet seems it to have held within it nothing more glorious than this man, nothing more holy marvellous and dear. The verses too of his godlike genius cry with a loud voice and set forth in such wise his glorious discoveries that he hardly seems born of a mortal stock. It is vulgarly supposed that by \"this great country\" Lucretius meant Sicily and by \"this man\" Empedocles; but it is plain enough that he really meant America and Walt Whitman—Any one can see that \"Vociferantur\" must have been intended to apply to the \"barbaric yawp\". Isn't it so? RMB.Should I take the motto from Lucretius I am uncertain whether to use the latin or the translation—the latin of course wdwould be the best but unfortunately so few read it. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, [12 June 1882?]"
