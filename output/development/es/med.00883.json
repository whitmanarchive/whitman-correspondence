I have just sent a half-page poem to Gilder, they have accepted, paid, proofed it, and I believe it will be out in May number.I have just had a drink of milk punch—am sitting at present in my two-story den in Mickle St, alone as usual, more buoyant than you might supposeWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, [2 March 1890]"
