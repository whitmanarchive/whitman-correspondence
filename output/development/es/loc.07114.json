    "text": "Asylum for the InsaneLondon, Ont.,24 Sept 1890Have your card of 21st. Am very much pleased to hear of the O'C. piece being written and shall be impatient to see it. I hope you have said nothing to Col. Ingersoll to influence him against the lecture but I guess you would not do that. The Fair is in full blast here—Asylum full of visitors from morning till night—two more days ends it thank the Lord. We are all well, meter affairs going on in a satisfactory mannerLove to you—So long—RM BuckeAre you going to send the M.S. of the O'C. piece to Mrs O'C.? If not I want very much to have it—Of course I do not want to interfere with any wish or feeling of yours on the subject—but if all favorable that way I want it very muchRMB Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1890"
