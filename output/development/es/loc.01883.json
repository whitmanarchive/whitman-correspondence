    "text": "187556 Euston Sq. N.W.24 March.Dear Mr. I received your letter with much pleasure. The facts about Whitman are briefly these. He lives with his brother, & is (I hope & believe) free from any real finish of poverty: but he has little or nothing of his own, & the American public continues to reject his books. He sent me over, for republication in England, an American newspaper notice setting forth in strong terms the unfavorable side of his position: this I got published in the Atheneum of 11 March. Buchanan saw it there, & sent his letter to the Daily News followed (14 March) by another letter of mine—wh.which I infer you have not seen. It said that a friend & I had already written to Whitman bespeaking various copies of his forthcoming books; that I had then asked Wh.Whitman whether he wd.would like me to push a similar or any other scheme among his admirers here; & that I was (& still I am) awaiting his reply.Since my D.N. letter several people have written to me offering to buy the books, or sub-scribesubscribe money: about £25 altogether: & Buchanan has received other similar offers.I did not see the article in the Standard: there was a very offensive one (not so however to me personally) in last Saturday Review.I write presently about these matters to WhWhitman—shall apprise him of your letter. When I receive his reply, I shall know exactly what—or whether anything—further shd.should be done.With best regardsVery truly Yours,W. M. Rossetti. William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 24 March 1875"
