I guess not)—I send to while away unoccupied hours—keep it as long as you stay in Providence—then return it to me here.W WYour 27th M[arch] letter has pleased me well—as all your letters do—Wm, let me know how the Heywood affair gets on, or turns out, as you hear from it—We (I and McKay) have been somewhat at a loss what to do in it—whether to send on some money ($20 or so)—or whether to remain entirely aloof & silent (& send no money)—I finally concluded on the latter—& I am quite clear that is the right course for me—mainly because it satisfies me best, upon the whole—What you say about Mrs Spofford's say lubricates my soul like precious ointment— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 29 March [1883]"
