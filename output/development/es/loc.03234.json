    "text": "New Haven Conn:July 1, 1885PO Box 489My dear Whitman: I see by the papers that you may be going to England. If you go you must see WmWilliam Bell Scott, the painter and poet, the first (unless, Dante Rossetti were earlier) of your English admirers. He will be glad to welcome you. And I glad to give you a note of introduction when I know you are going. We are old friends and regular correspondents, and I had much delightful time with him in England and Scotland during 1883 and '84, being then across the water. You will tell me too if I can be of other use to you. I may be visiting the dear old land again next year, probably having to look after the bringing out of a book—on Wood Engraving. As I am writing I think of something to send you, which ought to have come to you before. It is a bit of home-production, setting up, printing, binding and all. You'll not value it less for that. Need I say that I am glad to see a good report of your health and that, however drifted off—as seems too generally our human fate—I am always pleased to think of you. Let me hear from you and believe me always heartily yoursWJ Lintonfrom Linton July 1 '85see notes Oct 6 1888 William J. Linton to Walt Whitman, 1 July 1885"
