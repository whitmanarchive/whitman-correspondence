    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario28 Sept. '90Yours of 24 and 25 with the O'C. sketch came to hand last evening. I think our dear friend Mrs. O'C. will be more than pleased with the good honest Whitmanesque preface—it is right, could not be excelled, is just what was wanted—now for the Vol. of Tales—it ought to be out for Xmas since several of them are Xmas stories.I have all along been in favor of N.Y. for the speech, more especially if you could get therebut now I am in favor of Phila for the sake of the dear Pharisees there. If I were down East and assisting to run the thing I would give them (at least try to give them) a dose that they would remember and that would do them good. I would go in for the biggest hall or theatre to be had and would take care that the people knew what was being done to check freedom of speech in the city—I do not doubt the occasion properly handled could be converted into a splendid triumph for the good cause—I hope & trust our friends are awake to the importance of the crisis—tell Traubel if money is wanted to put me down for $50. and that I will send it any moment.Lovely bright cool day here—we are all well—meter goes on quietly and well—it is wonderfull[wonderful] however what time it takes to get started manufacturing—the making of thepatterns and the tools is what is delaying us now—these should be ready or about ready by the end of this week—we have been quite a few weeks at them—When the tools and patterns are once done there will be no more delay. The next thing will be to get orders for meters—if we can get these we can make money about as fast as we likeYour friendRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 September 1890"
