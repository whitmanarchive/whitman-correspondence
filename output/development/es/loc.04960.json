    "text": "Anderton, near ChorleyLancashire, England.15. Oct.br 1890Dear Walt Whitman,Your kind post-card of Sept. 30th recd on the 11th inst, and the pocket-book copy of L. of G. received this morning. Many thanks.I am glad to hear of the visit from John Burroughs, which I know would be a very great pleasure to you both. He told Dr J. that he wished very much that he could persuade you to live near him.Dr Johnston tells me that a friend of ours, + a school-fellow of mine,—Fred Wild—is likely to call upon you. He has been spending a little time in Canada, + wrote home that he would return by New York, + would probably go on to Camden to see you. Dr J. sent you a telegram to that effect last week. I understand, however, that he is likely to have left America before this reaches you. I spent 3 days in Yorkshire last week—so ending my holiday.—I am by no means so much recruited in health as I expected, but hope to improve gradually as time goes on.The weather here is broken—two or three days of fair weather alternating with a few days of rain. Fairly warm so far, getting colder at nights.Looking through some old papers the other day I came across a cutting from the \"Sunday Chronicle\" dated Feb 27th 1887. Probably you have not seen it, and I think I will enclose it. It is of very slight value but is interesting because of its source—the S. C. having a large circulation amongst the working classes here + being very radical + heterodox in character.—It pays you the left-handed compliment of professing to employ a \"Walt Whitman junior\" on its staff, whose verses often appear but do no credit to the name!Dr Johnston seems in good health now + very busy.I hope that the \"grippe\" has now left you, +, with love + best wishes always, remainYours affectionatelyJ. W. Wallace J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 15 October 1890"
