    "text": "Sept. 13, 1873Tho'sThomas O'KaneDear Sir,I have rec'd your letter of the 12th. I agree to allow you better than half off, namely you to acc'taccount to me at $1.40 ctscents a copy on the bound Leaves of Grass (which retails at $3)—and at 30 ctscents each for As a strong bird, (which retails at 75 ctscents.) I will be very happy to see you, at any time. I am stopping at 322 Stevens st. Camden, (cross by Phil. ferry from foot of Market st.—or Camden depot from N. Y.) If you are willing to go into selling my books, I think you ought to have some of the little 30 ctscents brochure \"After All not to Create Only\" published by Roberts Bros. Boston. I do not of course expect the sale could any how be a rushing one—but Walt Whitman to Thomas O'Kane, 13 September 1873"
