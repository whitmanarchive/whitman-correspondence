    "text": "Washington, D.C.September 16, 1868.Dear Walt:I was very sorry not to have seen you yesterday before you left, because the enclosed answer came from Westerman, and I wanted to consult with you as to the steps to be taken. I think a package ought to be made up at once for Ferdinand Freiligrath, and we can send it through Westerman, reimbursing him for any expense of transportation. I suppose it would be best to have it done by my agency, and I suggest that I write F. F. a letter, (to go with the package) explaining things generally, and making him as far as possible, master of the situation. What do you think? I am sorry I did not know you were going yesterday, because we could have arranged it all better than now.Preserve the enclosed. I think the sooner we do what is to be done (if anything) regarding F. F., the better.I write hurriedly, just on the edge of mail-time. No letters for you today at the Attorney General's. I hope you'll have a good time. Give my love to your mother. John came in yesterday and bid me tell you to come up to his house before you left. I did not then know you had gone. He will be disappointed.Affectionately Yours,W.D.O'Connor.Kindest regards to Mrs Price. William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 16 September 1867"
