    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden New JerseyDec: 8 '81Dear SirsI suppose you have got word that Trübner & Co: decline being the London publishers or agents of our Leaves of Grass, & that a friend there (in whom I have great confidence) has in the mean time (I suppose until you can be consulted) placed the agency in the hands of David Bogue, St. Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square. My friend seems to speak in a very recommendatory manner of D. B., & thinks the transfer will be no detriment to the sale of L of GLeaves of Grass in the long run—(& somehow I get the same impression)—Let me know soon as it is settled, as I have frequent occasion to give the London place of issue & deposit. I keep in good health for me—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to James R. Osgood & Company, 8 December 1881"
