    "text": "328 Mickle street—Camden New JerseyJune 18Dear S B—I just send Kennedy's letter & write on it what suggests to me impromptu—Yes I am making calculation on a conveniently plann'd & built house, & garden, of my own (cheap & democratic) either in the woods, or in sight of the sea, where I can haul in & breathe a sane atmosphere, & be secure like, either for the summers, or all the time yet vouchsafed to me. I think it would be best to get all the money-fund in Mrs. F's, O'Reilly's, K's & your hands (& any others if any others there be)—putting it in a draught payable to my order & send it to me here—I feel as if I could suit my wants & tastes better probably deciding & directing the practicality of the whole thing myself—(I am sure you will all understand it.) Show this to Mrs. F and O'R—I wish them to know too how appreciatingly & gratefully I feel ab't their help—& that I appoint you to fully act as my representative & (if need be) receiver in the matter.As I write I am sitting here by the open window—Birds singing & fine weather—but hot—Herbert Gilchrist, of England, is here painting a portrait of me to take to E—God bless you & all—Walt WhitmanPS.I have a shrewd guess that you intend to sell or rent yr present house, & build or bring the new one on the Long Island shore. But I shant impart my surmise to any one else. How happy I shall be to come & see you when you are in the new house! Egad, think of that, man,—the new house, I mean. Mrs F. has just sent in some plans for a building. They don't seem to know that you are a house builder. Walt Whitman to Sylvester Baxter, 18 June [1887]"
