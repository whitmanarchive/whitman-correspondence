    "text": "Providence R.I.October 17, '1888Dear Pete,According to announcement in my last, I have made a movement & change of base from tumultuous close=packed world-like N.Y. to the handsome, half=rural, brisk, handsome New England, third class town. I came on here last Thursday. I came as guest of Thomas Davis, formerly M.C. from this city—arrived between 8 and 9 o'clock at night—found his carriage at the depot wait'g for me—at the house—a sort of castle built of stone, on fine grounds a mile & a half from the town—a hearty welcome from his hospitable wife, & a family of young ladies & children—a hot supper, a tip-top room &c. &c. * So you see Pete, your old man is in clover. I have since been round the city & suburbs considerably. I am going down to Newport before I return. * Invitations &c. are numerous. I am in fact already dividing myself between two hospitalities, part of the time with Mr & Mrs. Davis, and part with Dr. & Mrs. Channing, old acquaintances of mine in another part of the city. I stopt last night at the house of the latter. It is on a high & pleasant hill at the side of the city, which it entirely overlooks. From the window of my room, I can look down across the city, the river, and over off miles upon miles in the distance. The woods are a real spectacle, colored with all the rich colors of autumn. Yesterday it was beautiful & balmy beyond description, like the finest Indian summer. I wandered around, partly walking partly in a carriage a good part of the day. To-day there is an entire change of scenery—As I sit writ'g this, what do you think Pete?—great flakes—of snow are fall'g, sometimes —the wind blows gusts—quite a thick flurry—in fact a real snow=storm has been go'g on all the forenoon though without the look & or feeling of winter, as the grass & foliage are autumnal, & the cold is not severe yet. Still it disagreeable, & wet & dark, & prevents me from going out. So I will make it up by writing a couple of letters—one to mother, & one to you tell'g you about things. Providence is a handsome city of about 70000 inhabitants—has numerous manufactories in full operation—every thing looks lively. From the house up here, I can hear almost any time, night or day, the sound of factory bells & the steam whistles of locomotives half a mile distant. Then the lights at night seen from here make a curious exhibition. At both the places I stop, we have plenty of ripe, fresh fruit and lots of flowers. Pete I could now send you a bouquet every morn'g, far better than I used to, for much choicer flowers.And how are you gett'g along, dearest comrade? I hope you are well, & that every th'g is going on right with you. I have not heard from you for a good while it seems. I suppose you got my last letter, 14th from N.Y. I expect to return to N.Y. there about the 22d. Should you feel to write after receiving this, you might direct to 331 East 55th st. as before. I am well as usual. I am luxuriating on excellent grapes. I wish I could send you a basket. At both places I stop they have vineyeards, & the grapes are very good & plenty this year. Last night, when I went up at 11 o'clock to my room, I took up three great bunches, each as big as my fist, & sat down and eat them before I turned in. I like to eat them this way, & it agrees with me.It is quite a change here from my associations & surroundings either in Washington or New York. Evenings, & meal time I find myself thrown amidst a mild pleasant society, really intellectual composed largely of educated women, some young, some not so young, every thing refined & polite, not disposed to small talk, to convers'g in earnest, on profound subjects, but with a moderate rather slow tone, & in a kind & conciliatory manner—delighting in this sort of conversation & spending their evenings in it till late. I take a hand in, for a change. I find it entertaining, as I say , for novelty's sake for a week or two—but I know very well that would be enough for me. It is all first rate good & smart, but too constrained & bookish for a free old hawk like me.I send you my love dear Pete. So long. Will write from N.Y. soon as I return there.W WP.S. just after 12 oclock—noon—as I am just finish'g,—the storm lightens up—I am sure I see a bit of blue sky in the clouds—yes the sun is certainly break'g out. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 17 October 1888"
