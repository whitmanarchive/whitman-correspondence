    "text": "GermantownAfternoon Aug: 6Dear friend,Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you a few lines to pass for a letter,—though the Lord only knows what I shall write about, for I have no news to tell, & nothing special to say——I came out here on a visit to an old friend a few days ago, & shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week—The family, (& a fine one they are) are at Newport for the summer—my friend, the father, goes to his business in Philadelphia absent all day, & I am left here master of a large house garden, library &c. with servants, horses,—a good dinner at 1 o'clock every day—have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it—It is a Quaker family I am very much attached to—(I believe I have mentioned them to you before)—all kind & good—but the ones that seem most to me are the eldest daughter Mary (ab'tabout 21) the brightest happiest sunniest cutest young woman you ever saw, & probably you would say upon knowing her, a new & different combination of character from any you ever saw—& one I am sure you would like—And then the father himself, my friend—he is in business in Phila:Philadelphia—he has been a great traveler in Europe, & something of a preacher—he is a good talker—& very kind—we always have a good long ride, from 5 to 7½ afternoons—which I enjoy very much—& then return to supper—& a couple of hours talking, reading &c.Then there is all now at Newport as I said another daughter & a son, a young man—all dear friends of mine—I have been here quite a good deal the last year & a half, when they were all home—but now no one but the father & myself here—I wish you could have two or three good drives with me about here—we have a fast, strong, gentle young sorrel mare—first rate—the roads & views are the finest you ever saw—& now they show at their best—Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon & evening seem'dseemed to me one of the most perfect for weather &c I ever knew—we drove out to a hill about an hour from here & had a view over twenty miles towards Bethlehem,—fields & farms & rolling country—some woods—the richest tract in Pennsylvania. It was an hour before sundown. It was like Paradise. (It will have a good effect upon me the rest of the summer.)Mont was in to see me ab'tabout a week ago—By his acc'taccount you must have a house full. I hope you keep up health & spirits—Love to Ruth—Ed also—(I havn'thaven't forgot those rides evenings off among the pea-pickers)—Respects to Messrs. Wyld and Edwards—Nothing specially new with me—I am only middling well—seem to be getting clumsier than ever, more loguey—rheumatic & other ailments—My loss (money, dues, &c) I alluded to, from the letter rec'dreceived when I was down there, is worse than I expected—(I knew all the spring & early summer there would be something, for I was feeling too well & prosperous & sassy)——If I could only feel well & sleep well, though (which I do not) I should not care a straw for pecuniary botherations & losses. What a beautiful ten days we have had past! I hope Ed's things are all turning out well. So good bye for this time, dear friendW WRuth fatten up some o'of them chickens & have 'emthem ready for early fall Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 6 August [1883]"
