    "text": "LondonFeb 10—84DrDear Old Friend:Am quite well with the exception of the abcess on my neck, it has come again. Dr. B— lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better. Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted. Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance to drop a line. Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for me and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening. Don't get the blues worth a damdamn and dont expect to. Will close for the present.With lots of love, I remain as Ever your true and devoted sonHarry Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 10 February 1884"
