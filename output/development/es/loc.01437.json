City of Berlin\"Inman Line\"Jersey City27-9-88Dear SirToday I was coming to Camden full of hope that I might see you but I have not enough money to pay my railway fare to and from Camden. I am only a steward on the City of Berlin—you will see me? Yes—you are good—may I come to see you when my ship returns in about a month? The City of Berlin sails early on Saturday the 29th—may I hope for a few words from you before she sails—I cannot write the things I would write to you—I could not speak the words I would wish to speak—but if I could see your face—if I could hear your voice! I hope—Will you accept my \"Minutiæ.\" Will you—if you are able—write to me.I amYour'sCharles William Dalmonc/o Duggan & Co34 James StreetLiverpoolEngland Charles William Dalmon to Walt Whitman, 27 September 1888"
