    "text": "R. M. Pulsifer & Co.Proprietors.R. M. Pulsifer,E. B. Haskell,C. H. Andrews.The Herald,Boston,Aug. 2, 1887My dear Friend:I enclose for the cottage $285 in two checks of $50 and $235 respectively. On the former you will see the signature of one of the best of your Boston friends, Dr. Wesselhoeft. This will make $788 so far, I believe, and I think the remaining $12 will be forthcoming soon.I wish it might have been done so as to enable you to escape this hot weather altogether, but I hope you can contrive to get away before the summer ends. Shall you get some house that is already built, or do you propose building?Would you not like in the house a nice fireplace where you can sit and toast your toes before a nice open fire and dream with open eyes as you look at the blaze? I think you would enjoy that better than an ugly black stove that scorches all the vitality out of the air. If the idea pleases you, my friend, Jack Law, the Chelsea tile-maker, would like to send you a handsome set of tiles for it. Law knew you in the old Pfaff days, when he was a landscape painter, but says you probably would not recollect him by name. Very likely you might remember his vigorous expletives, and great enthusiasm!I think I may go on to New York next week and run over to Philadelphia when I shall drop in on you.Faithfully yours,Sylvester Baxter.P.S.â€”Oh! About Hartmann. He was altogether \"too previous\" and hardly appreciated what he had undertaken. He did not know how to go to work and appointed officers of a society which had not been organized! We all had to sit down on him and the matter is in abeyance. I hope it may come to something later. You may remember I wrote you last winter about the idea of a W. W. Society.S.B.see notes sept 22 & 25 '88Baxter Sylvester Baxter to Walt Whitman, 2 August 1887"
