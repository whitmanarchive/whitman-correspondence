    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANE LONDON ONTARIO London, Ont.,17 Aug 1888I have today your letter of 14th enclosing p. 110 with portrait of E.H. I have the book complete now from p. 5 to p 140 both inclusive. Your idea seems to be to sell Nov. Boughs at a reasonable price, and for a special vol. get up the Complete works all in one cover. I like this notion, think it is the best plan altogether and hope you will carry it out. The big vol. should contain several portraits of yourself and perhaps other illustrations (why not use the phototypes of your father & mother that Gutekunst got up for my book?)—Should have (each copy) an actual autograph. I wish you would use the little introductory poem to \"As a strong bird\" and sign it—no lithograph—and number each copy as you sell it. The paper should be very good hand made but rather thin so as not to make the vol. too bulky—wide margins—uncut edges except the top which should be gilt—the cover should be best cloth, green, with a sprig of grass & flowers in gold on the back below the title. Book to be sold only by yourself for $10.I like the \"N.B.\" (and especially the \"Sands\" & \"E.H.\") more and more (,the \"Backward Glance\" and \"Last of War Cases\" about as valuable) I think the little vol. a most admirable contribution.—Pardee is back from the Sea side, very little better I fear. I expect to go to Sarnia tomorrow to spend Sunday with him.Your friendRM BuckeGables Here is a Bucke letter which you may stick into the proper place of my vol 2 With W.W. in Camden H.T.: 1909.See notes Aug 20 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 August 1888"
