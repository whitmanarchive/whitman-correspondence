    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,28 Nov. 1888I have your fine long welcome letter of 24th I am glad the big book keeps moving—I hope you will hit on a good picturesque, characteristic cover for it—this will be the book of the future and should not be too commonplace in any way. The cover of the '60–1 ed. might be taken as a point to start from—with some modification, perhaps toning down, that cover (the style of it) would not do badly. I have written a line to Garland—his column in the Transcript was admirable. Nothing new from Wm Gurd, expect him here very soon, then as soon as we can get Canadian and European patents secured we shall go East. I am uneasy about O'Connor, if you hear from him let me know how he is—I am afraid he is not doing well—wish I could see him.Remember me to Ed. Wilkins tell him that every thing goes quietly along here since he left usThe weather is stupid this morning (dull & heavy) and I think I am a little stupid myself—nothing very wonderful if I amShall soon write againLove to youR M Buckesee notes Nov 30 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 November 1888"
