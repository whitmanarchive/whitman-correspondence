    "text": "Haddonfield, NJ.New JerseyJuly 18th—80Mr Whitman—Dear Friend,I received your much welcome note some time ago, but have been so very busy that I have not had time to write to you. You cant think how pleased I was to get your letter and to learn that you thought of your Jersey friends while so far away from us, yet I was sorry to to hear that you have been ill I hope when you get this you will be enjoying better health. Joe was very sick two or three weeks ago, but is better now; and I am enjoying my usual good health. I suppose you wonder what has kept me so busy I will tell you. Lizzie Hider has been staying with me for two weeks past, and I have had so much sewing to do for Ruth— getting ready for festivals, picnics and such—that it all has kept me very busy but the picnics will soon be over and then I shall not have so much to doDo you hear from the Gilchrists often it has been some time since Mother heard from them. You spoke of being reminded of me so much up there. I wish I could be there for I think I should enjoy a visit up that way very much and particularly this warm weather. I think you need to be glad you are away in a cool climate this warm weather, for it has been almost hot enough to roast a body down here. It is getting late and news is scarce I will closeWrite soon again and let us know how you enjoyed your trip up the St. LSt. Lawrence—Debbie V. BrowningHaddonfieldWith love from Joe and my self Deborah V. Browning to Walt Whitman, 18 July 1880"
