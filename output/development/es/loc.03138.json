    "text": "May 27: 75My dear Walt WhitmanYour kind letter is received and the sad news of your ill health makesthis pleasant weather now seem tiresome and out of place. I had hoped to find you the same hole and whole man I had met in New York a few years goago and now I shall perhaps find you bearing you a staff and full of pain and torture. However my dear friend as you have lived from within and nor from without I am sure you will be able to bear whatever comes with that beautiful faith and philosophy you have ever given us in your great and immortal chants.I am coming to you really soon, as you request; but I cannot say to day or yet tomorrow for I am in the midst of work and am not altogether my own master. But I will come and we will talk it all over together. In the meantime remember that whateer[whatever] befalls you you have the perfect love and sympathy of many if not all of the noblest and loftiest natures of the two hemispheres. Till I see you my dear friend and fellow toiler goodbye Yours fitfullyJoaquin Miller Joaquin Miller to Walt Whitman, 27 May 1875"
