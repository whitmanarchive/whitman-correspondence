    "text": "Washington, D.C.November 1, 1888.Dear Walt:I was so impressed with the letter Mr. Stetson wrote a year ago about the calendar, that I got Grace to send it to me from California, and enclose you a copy, thinking you might like to see it. You can return it sometime, as I have sent back the original.It does not say much, to be sure, but it has large import, and makes me long for such a mind to do the calendar. Don't you think so?â€”The eye is as bad as ever, and I see with difficulty.Goodbye,Always faithfully.W. D. O'C William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 1 November 1888"
