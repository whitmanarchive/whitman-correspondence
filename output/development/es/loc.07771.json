    "text": "[London, Ont.,]8 Jan [188]9Yours of 5th/ and 6th/ came to hand this a.m. The little piece to \"The year '89\" enclosed. It is fierce and strong, do not see where (in your condition) the force comes from to write such lines so savage and bitter with their double and treble meaning. I trust you are (even if \"very very slowly\") gaining and am glad to have you say that you believe in my diagnosis of letter of 24th Dec. If you can only be sure and not take more than the system can day by day dispose of (and excrete the waste from), you may do pretty well for a long time. The fault is not that you eat too much—(I do not suppose you are inclined to eat more than would be good for you) but that your excretary organs (especially bowels & kidneys) are in such poor trim. I note what you say of Sylvester Baxter's criticism in Boston Herald. He has not sent me a copy and I have not seen it yet—I hope either you or Traubel will send it me at once. The big book ought to be on the market. When will it be? Binding I suppose not settled upon yet?Yesterday was municipal election day with us here. Today the children begin going to school again. No winter yet, soft, dirty, muggy weather All however goes quietly and wellLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 8 January 1889"
