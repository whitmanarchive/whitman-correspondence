    "text": "7 June: 76Dear Friend,I have now received a series of papers & post cards, yet have never once ventured to reply, & I am in sort afraid you will deem me growing cold in my sympathy for you with my long silence. It is not so and I hope it never will be: I have been waiting all this time in the hopes that I might have a cheery letter to write you of how all goes on here in your matters, but I learn from Rosetti that he is keeping you well up with news up to date, so that on that score I find I have no news to write you that you wont[won't] already know. so far I learn all goes on pretty well with the kind aid of all our English folk that care and love you they seem all to be doing their best to get subscribers to your noble testimonial to your countries[country's] 100 years To me it seems a fitting and truly beautiful offering, and one that I hope to see your people yet—warmly and tenderly appreciate at its worth. one item I deem they will never forget, I mean your noble services to the gallant souls who fought and eved died for the Union of their Land—The reading of their memorandums made me almost weep and faint I saw you in the midst of them. Aye mentally I was near you. I heard you speak to them: I saw them look on you, grasp your hand, embrace you, Kiss you: the eyes of them I saw that glistened upon you. Oh man, how I wished while I read I was near you, to tell you how I felt for you, how I loved you, and even begrudged the love and sympathy you realized from these Hero's[Heroes]. I fain would have been you. I feel like Ruskin when I read such actions of love, that I fain would be the actor oh brave kind generous soulin them memories of thine, why need thou care for us poor puny souls. men nursed in luxery's lap one may say: men who know scant anything then[than] one's petty duties from day to day, even several of them shirked too? While thou has been a father, mother, nurse, doctor, priest, and who can tell all, to thousands. Well. Well, let them rail thou and thy work, will live in the hearts of these men, and in the memories of them who are in the other region: fear not the storm will pass by—P.S.I cannot close this note without stating that I have now placed copies of your Poems in all our towns' libraries, in Shields, Manchester, Newcastle, Warrington, Birkenhead, Liverpool, London, Plymouth, Morpeth, Tynemouth.. and other places in all I find I have circulated some 80 copies of including the English one, and American ones. so you see the little hand's been a working one. Thomas Dixon to Walt Whitman, 7 June 1876"
