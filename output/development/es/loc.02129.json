    "text": "Jamaica Plain.April 19/88Walt Whitman:Dear Sir: It is probable that my friend Kennedy has told you something of me and the work I am trying to do for you and for American literature. I have not written to you for the reason that you are sufficiently plagued with letters but now I feel that I have reached the point where I can presume on your interest.Mr. Kennedy I know writes to you in a depressed mood many times, saying that he finds a \"solid line of enemies\" (I think those were his words) This is not true of my experience. I am often astonished at finding so many friends and sympathizers in your work and cause. In my teaching and lecturing I find no difficulty in getting Converts to the new doctrine and find your poems nearly irresistible in effect. True they do not always agree that they are \"poems\" though acknowledging their power and beauty. I do not care what they call them (I say to them) and receive their allegiance just the same.I hope to do much in the way of reading and lecturing to bring your work before the people and it would give me pleasure to know you consider my work valuable.I am just now delivering a course of lectures in the city on \"The Literature of Democracy\" concerning which I enclose a couple of slips.In these I am trying to analyze certain tendencies of American Life somewhat in accordance with the principles you have taught. How successful I may be remains to be seen.â€”I have not seen Mr. Kennedy for some months, he is so busy these days, but I had a characteristic letter from him a few days ago. I have the greatest hope of seeing you some day and to talk with you upon these matters face to face. Let me assure you again that there is everywhere a growing respect and love for you and a growing appreciation of your poems. The papers no longer ridicule or even condemn unreservedly. An acquantaince among the younger literary editors of the city warrants me in saying that there is much more sympathy and appreciation among them than our friend Kennedy realizes. There is great gain.It would give me great pleasure to hear from you if you are able to write.With greatest love and esteem.Hamlin Garland.Send to Dr Bucke Hamlin Garland to Walt Whitman, 19 April 1888"
