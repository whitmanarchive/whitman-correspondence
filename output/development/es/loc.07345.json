    "text": "Superintendent's Office Asylum for the InsaneLondon.Ontatio.London, Ont., 14 April 18 90 I have your card of 10th reporting some improvement in your condition—that you had eaten bread and drank coffee for first time in ten days. So far good and I trust all is still on the mend with you. Just here your letter of 11th comes to hand, you are evidently gaining, but I feel exceedingly doubtful as to the propriety of your attempting the lecture tomorrow—no doubt however the question will be settled one way or another before you get this. I wish I could see you and I will before many weeks. Horace has asked me to write a little piece, \"W.W. and Modern Science\" for the Conservator. Shall do it of course. All quiet here. Weather much cooler/more seasonable today Love to you as alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 14 April, 1890"
