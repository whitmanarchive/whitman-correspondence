    "text": "Camden New Jersey | 328 Mickle StreetSept: 1 '87My dear friendI wish you could take half an hour if possible & go around for me to Mr Cox photographer cor: 12th St. & Broadway. He advertises (Century, Sept. number) to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged, & the former illegal & unauthorized. When in N Y last April I was taken there by Miss Gilder & sat for pictures under promise that I should see them in specimens & decide wh' should be printed & put forth, & wh' not. Since, all requests to have them (proofs or specimens) sent me here have been ignored. The whole thing is cool, very. Go round & see if C will immediately send me copies of the pictures & follow my requests ab't them—Or will it be necessary for me to clap a legal injunction on the issue?—wh' I shall certainly do—You can show this note to Mr Cox—Walt WhitmanTake Alma with you, if she likes. Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 1 September 1887"
