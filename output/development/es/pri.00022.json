    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street Camden NNew Jersey U S AmericaJune 26 '761876Dear friend,Yours of June 14 just rec'dreceived—also the corrected circulars. (Yours of the 16th, of the 25th, of the 26th, & of the 29th May, previously acknowledged) All gives me entire satisfaction & comfort—arousing my deepest gratitude. All here goes as well as could be expected—even better—except that the new edition is rather slow in getting ready to be sent to subscribers, but will very soon be ready, & all the good friends & subscribers will have their copies carefully sent to their addresses by mail prepaid, (as I find this is the best way)—There were really only 100 of the first edition printed and they have become exhausted—that is the reason of some present delay—but, as said in former letter, every order & purchase will be faithfully supplied (only let the address of the friend be full & plain, in every instance, the same as they have been hitherto)—& all lagging copies—yours & Mrs. G'sGilchrist's among the rest—will also be carefully sent in due time——The Two Vols.Volumes of the new edition, will be identically the same in every literary respect, text, pictures, autograph & photo. but a different binding,—(substantial, but less showy,—good strong, half-calf, marble paper, leather tips, no gilt)—I am printing of this new ed.edition 600 L. of G.Leaves of Grass and 650 Two RRivulets—They will soon be ready—I have notified you that Vols.Volumes have been forwarded to & rec'dreceived, acknowledged by J. L. Warren, Reynell, (thank him for his kind generous note) W B. Scott, (him also) and to A. G. Dew Smith—also to Therese Simpson, of Edinburgh—also Geo. Wallis, Kensington Art Museum—(& I believe one or two others)—I sent 2 copies Memoranda of War (one bound, one in sheets) to N. MacColl, Athenaeum, June 12. (Your special copy Mem. of course was for you to keep, as your name was written in it by me.) I have not yet rec'dreceived my pay for the little Man-of-War-Bird in Athenaeum nor the prose piece on the War in the Examiner. If convenient the editors can send to me by p.o. money order, as I find that very straight & sure.—Joaquin Miller comes occasionally to see me—his visits are pleasant to me—Did you get the Pre-Raphaelite article in the Galaxy I sent? Also J. M'sJoseph Marvin's letter to me about it?—Longfellow has also been to see me—(a sort of one-horse visit)Tennyson sent £5 at once to Buchanan (on the latter's letter) who sent it to me—I havn'thaven't written lately to T., as I supposed him abroad on the continent—but I intend to write soon—& send him a set of my books—I am not at all sure that A. T. sees my poems—but I do his, & strongly, (& there perhaps I have the advantage of him)—but I think he sees me—& nothing could have evidenced more courtesy, & manliness, & hospitality, than his letters to me have shown, for five years. Buchanan has sent me six or seven names, (& a cheque)—will all soon be supplied, with the rest—Let me know if you find Ch. Kent—Has the Secularist my address?—Middling well—very hot weather here—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 26 June 1876"
