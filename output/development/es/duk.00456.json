    "text": "21 Pearl St. Dec 29. 90. Our kind friend and Bro Walt. Clearest sky I ever saw—norwest quite purple—snow white on roofs and posts—Lake steaming, seething, cold-compressed— freezing—unusual, not Known in years past—never—at so early a day—ChristmassChristmas. God bless you Walt, You are badly stricken—never to recover—to be as you once were—erect, vigorous—none of us can be, and yet you are blessed with and by a large heart, full of humanity—sympathies for all and everyone—for Han particularly—She is much stricken, Walt—gray—thin, her hair blanched—whitened—her hands shrunken—the bones protruding as it were—yet she has staunchly kneaded bread and made a sweet loaf for herself, she has been crawing after, several days—The public have treated us well. 1 ton of coal now in use, sent by Isham J. Bliss, Episcopal clergyman, an old friend—50 lbs choice flour—3 fowls and a turkey, by other friends unknown—bread, sugars—teas, coffee—Lou sent 1 Ham—delcious—cake—jellies—coffee tea—delicious—and clothing for Han—also 2 dollars—nothing for me—I am unworthy, although I entreated but for 5 dollars, to help pay my interest of 15 at the Bank. Your donation of 5 came very timely—I had sold a small painting for 10—I send you the bank rect—very stupid and very mean I consider George and Lou to be—We might have been attacked—and compelled to raise the amt—so small—after so many years. One more claim for slagging side walk, $86. I have paid up nearly all. I think that I can settle balance for 10$—Have some expectations of selling a painting cheap—I am bad off for clothes—I botbought a pair of stockings for self for 30 cents, all I have had this winter— any shoes are worn out—botbought last winter̬hurting feet now̬God! What a country! People! world̬I rekindle at 5 O'clock and have a warm house̬first in the kitchen̬Han is not well, yet does for herself̬I get mad sometimes̬sorry̬don't meant to. Bless you Walt for the 5 dollars̬Han has about 10 dollars a-head for herself̬. Good bye Walt, our Friend in Deed.Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 29 December, 1890"
