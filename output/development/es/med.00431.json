    "text": "Camden, March 25 '74To: J. C. MannTuft's CollegeBox 55College Hill, Mass.Your letter of the 20th (for committee) has reached me here. I accept with pleasure the invitation to deliver a poem to your college & visitors next June. Without any thing very definite at this moment, my idea is of a poem, fitting in not unappropriately[inappropriately] to such an occasion, the recital of which would not occupy more than 30 minutes. All the pay I would want would be enough to pay my expenses, transportation &c., probably between 30 and $40, certainly not more than the latter sum. Please acknowledge this & please write me more particulars about your college, where it is, specialties, if any &c. I am stopping here, not entirely well, but able to get around, recovering from an attack of paralysis of over a year ago. W. W. Walt Whitman to J. C. Mann, 25 March 1874"
