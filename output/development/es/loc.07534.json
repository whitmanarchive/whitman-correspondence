Millet, in a French translation—I found it very absorbing, sharp & hard—with a strongly eulogistic preface by W D Howells—a little book pub'd by Harpers—Horace bro't it to me—8½ Horace pays his welcome evening visit—Wednesday 26th—10¾ A MI continue fairly—have had my breakfast, & the fine weather continues—two welcome letters from you this morning's mail—I watch with interest the meter—Gurd fortunes & struggles—Well for now New years—& then 1889—God bless you & yours—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 25–26 December 1888"
