    "text": "Brooklyn, September 15, 1870.Dear Pete,Your letters of 10th and 12th have come safe, & are welcome—dear son, I see you are hard at work & appear to be in lively spirits—I am glad to hear you practice with the Arithmetic—I wish you to try & do a little with it every day—practice makes perfect—you will see how soon & how clear it will all come to you—If you have the Geography or Atlas, look into that a little too—one needs to have an idea of the world too. I am concerned to hear of the death of Amos Dye—poor Amos—he was one of the first (I don't know but the very first) of the railroad men there I got acquainted with, & rode with—Pete, if there is any further subscription for Mrs. Dye, I authorize you to put me down for $5—I will either send the money, or give it to her when I return—I shall return in about three weeks. I am now in the eighth week of my furlough—it is seven weeks last Tuesday night since we parted there at the corner of 7th street. Well, Pete, dear loving boy, I must now close for to-day. Walt.late Friday afternoon Sept. 16. Dear son, I have time to add only a few words, in order to put it in the mail this evening—I am working a while every day at my printing yet—but I go around considerable—still go out in the bay—& enjoy myself among my friends here—& in riding around, &c—The weather is very fine, both days & nights. I don't know whether I told you how I stand now about the war—suffice it to say, that as things have gone on, & as the case stands, I find myself now far more for the French than I ever was for the Prussians—Then I propose to take my first drink with you when I return, in celebrations of the pegging out of the Pope & all his gang of Cardinals & priests—& the entry of Victor Emanuel into Rome, & making it the capital of the great independent Italian nation. Good bye till next time, darling boy. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 15–16 September 1870"
