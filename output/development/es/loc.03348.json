    "text": "Washington, D.C.Life Saving Service,October 9, 1888Dear Walt:I was delighted to get yours of the 7th, with the welcome November Boughs. My eye is now under battery treatment (assault-and-battery treatment, you would think to look at it!) and just as soon as I can recover my sight a little better, I will plunge into the volume, which now invites me through a thick blur. I hope David McKay will do better with it than he has done with your other books. I long for you to have a good publisher.More anon.â€”The weather here has turned very cold, though bright, and I am barking with influenza. November bow-wows! (Isn't this insulting!)I hope you keep comfortable. Nelly sends her love.Always affectionately.W.D.O'ConnorWalt Whitman.Wm D.O'ConnorSee notes Oct 11, 1888 William D. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 9 October 1888"
