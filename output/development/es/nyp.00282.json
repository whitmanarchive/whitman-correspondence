    "text": "BrooklynWednesday forenoon, July 26. Dear William O'Connor,I take it by the enclosed from Rossetti that he has sent me the Westminster by mail to Washington, & that it is now there, probably in the A. G. office. You go down & see, & get it to read. (May be in p. o.)Mother's health is about reëstablished if nothing unfavorable occurs. I shall return to Washington early next week. I start this afternoon for New Haven for one day only—an emergency—an artist friend of mine is very low there with consumption—is in fact dying—& has expressed the most earnest wish to see me—We have been, & are, having a cold easterly rain storm here—I enclose, on loan, the last two photos of my most sweetly philosophic & fascinating self—(for you to gaze upon till I return)—The Swinburne Hilliard article has been copied in the World, Home Journal, &c. &c.Not a word of the Westminster article—The ungodly, (sorely tried,) will of course endeavor to ignore it, & leave it entirely unmentioned & uncommented on, if possible—but that will not be possible—It is a powerful essay—I have been reading it over carefully a second time—It strikes the true chords—even the name \"The Poetry of Democracy\" &c—is it not pregnant? from your loving oldWalt Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 26 July [1871]"
