    "text": "Washington October 8 | 1863 Dear friend Your letter was received, enclosing one from Mary Wigglesworth with $30 from herself & her sisters Jane & Anne—As I happened stopping at one of the hospitals last night Miss Lowe just from Boston came to me & handed the letters—My friend, you must convey the blessings of the poor young men around me here, many amid deepest afflictions not of body only but of soul, to your friends Mary, Jane, & Anne Wigglesworth. Their & all contributions shall be sacredly used among them. I find more & more how a little money rightly directed, the exact thing at the exact moment, goes a great ways, to make gifts comfort & truly nourish these American soldiers, so full of manly independence, is required the spirit of love & boundless brotherly tenderness, hand in hand with greatest tact. I do not find any lack in the storehouses, nor eager willingness of the North to unlock them for the soldiers—but sadly everywhere a lack of fittest hands to apply, & of just the right thing in just the right measure, & of all being vivified by the spirit I have mentioned—Say to the sisters Mary & Jane & Anne Wigglesworth, & to your own sister, Margaret, that as I feel it a privilege myself to be doing a part among these things, I know well enough the like privilege must be sweet to them, to their compassionate & sisterly souls, & need indeed few thanks, & only ask its being put to best use, what they feel to give among sick & wounded. I have received L B Russell's letter & contribution by same hand, & shall try to write to him to-morrow—WaltAddress | care Major Hapgood | paymaster U S A cor 15th & F st | Washington D C. Walt Whitman to Hannah E. Stevenson, 8 October 1863"
