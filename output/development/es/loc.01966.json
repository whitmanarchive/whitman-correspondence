    "text": "Arlington, Mass.July 20. 1867.My Dear Friend,W.H. Piper Co. of Boston say they would like to place your new Edition of the \"Leaves\" on their counter, & sell it as they sell other books. They would take, say, 50 copies to begin with. There is a small continuous dropping-in demand for the \"Leaves,\" & copies of the Thayer & Eldridge edition sell for $5. You might write directly to W.H. Piper, using my name. He will be a good man to retail the book: he would also have undertaken to publish & push it but for the opposition of others.Mr. Newton was not able to call on you for the little volume you wished to send me by him. It came by mail,â€”through W.D. O'C's agency, I perceive, with a N.Y. Times enclosed. I thank you both. I had already bought a copy of the critique, but as a friend had carried it off, I was very glad to get another. It is a unique & delightful little treatise: how bold & fresh & native! I hope some day to see the author.My love to the O'Connors. I owe Wm for a long & eloquent letter, received I don't dare to say how long ago. I am hungry to see you & him and Mrs. O'C. again: if you or they ever come near me, you must surely visit me.Sincerely your friendJ.T. Trowbridge John Townsend Trowbridge to Walt Whitman, 20 July 1867"
