My daughter Clare is still in bed but will be up in a day or two I trust. There is nothing in God's world more absurd than these balls & parties at which one sits up all night pretending to have a good time and (without any pretence) has a very bad time for some days afterwards. I am impatient to hear about the W.W. dinner I think I could have had a \"good time\" at that if I could have got there. The weather here keep[keeps] singularly dark and cold. I am just at the end of poor O'Connor's last book Mr. \"Donnelly's Reviewers\" it is wonderfully clever.â€”R M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 June 1889"
