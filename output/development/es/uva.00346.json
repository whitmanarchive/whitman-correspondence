My mother & folks are all well—I rece'd[received] the letter enveloped to me 25th—I sent a line to Wm O'Connor, 25th, which I suppose he rec'd—has Nelly gone yet? I shall write to her next time—remember me to Ashton with friendship—also to Arnold Johnson with sincere thanks & tell him I am getting well—& give my best respects & thanks to Major Hapgood.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Charles W. Eldridge, 28 June 1864"
