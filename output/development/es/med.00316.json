    "text": "I went up to your house this morning and took a look at the garden—Everything growing first rate—potatoes, tomatoes, corn, cabbages, and all—I guess upon the whole the garden never looked better at this time of year. We have had opportune rains—I inquired about the cow, and received a favorable report. . . .John, about coming, I am not able to say anything decisive in this letter. . . . Up in your Bureau all seems to go on as usual . . . John, I send you the July Atlantic. . . .I am feeling hearty and in good spirits—go around more than usual—go to such doings as base-ball matches and the music Performances in the Public grounds—Marine Band, etc. . . .I hope your parents are well—I wish you to give them my love—tho' I don't know them, I hope to one of these days—remember me to the wife, also.I am writing this by my window in the office—the breeze is blowing moderate, and the view down the river and off along Virginia hills opposite is most delightful—the pardon clerks are middling busy—I have plenty of leisure, as usual—I spent yesterday afternoon at the Hospital, and took tea in the evening at O'Connor's. Piatt is trying to get transferred to New York, to the Custom House—Well, good by for present, you dear friend, and God bless you and wife, and bring you both safe back—Walt Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 2 July 1866"
