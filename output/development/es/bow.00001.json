Please see an article by me in the forthcoming number of the N ANorth American Review for February, in which I have ventilated some of my notions on Poetry in America. The article from the London Times (June '78) there alluded to & partially extracted from, ought to be printed here in this country in full—how would you like to do it?—would make ¾ or less of one of your pages close—if yes I will send you the Times with it in.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to E. H. Hames & Co., 16 January 1881"
