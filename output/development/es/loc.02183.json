    "text": "sent to Mildred and Frank Bain Dec 19 11 | Horace Traubel29/9/85.12 Well RoadEngland Hampstead LondonDear Walt Your last letter to hand,—Disappointed not to hear a better account of your health yet, hoped that you were beginning to get around as usual, and like my mother, you are one who misses fresh air so. Mother is very sadly, obliged to leave off writing (pro tem only I hope.)—a sort of nervous prostration and asthma which aggravated by sleeplessness wch has gone on for the last month and the struggle for breath is making her very weak. I send you a letter from one Edward Pease of (Quaker stock) an admirer & active friend of yours over here in a quiet way. He is rendering some assistance over the \"Tribute\" etc: Perhaps you will write to him or Her about it. Alma Tadema the most celebrated artist over here has written to congratulate me over my last picture (finished this summer) and wch he saw at a friend's house. It is rather a feather in my cap—and will perhaps prove a turning point in my artistic career, who knows! I lead a quiet but moderately varied life and am able to enjoy my work and possess one or two friends. Thanks for news about Staffords very glad to hear that they are all well. I had heard from Mrs Stafford that Ruthie had married; but how young! a long hard life I doubt me! With best loveHerbert Harlakenden Gilchrist. P.S. Thank you for list of names have had a nice letter from J A Symonds, enclosing cheque for five quid. Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 29 September 1885"
