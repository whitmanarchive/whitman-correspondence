N.Y.,Dec. 17th 1888.My dear Uncle Walt:I thought you would like to see your little Kittie's face so send my photograph wishing with it that you may have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We have once more a nest but need one dear person to make the family complete; this person is a Grandpa; won't you come and be one to us; we would all be so happy if you came. There is a pretty park in front which is nice even in Winter; at night the electric lights are very pretty. Then in Summer you could walk in the park with us children as you used to do on 5th Ave. Do come when ever it pleases you (but I want you very; very soon!)I go to a school about a mile from here which gives me a nice walk on pleasant days.We children expect to go to \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" sometime this week.Good bye now, Dear Uncle Walt, hoping to see you soon,I am,your loving littleKittie.(from my dear friend, Little Kitty (14 yr's old) daughter of my friend Johnston the jeweler—with very nice photo)—answered Katherine Johnston to Walt Whitman, 17 December 1888"
