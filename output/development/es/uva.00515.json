    "text": "Jan. 3, 1887328 Mickle StreetCamden New Jersey U S AmericaFriendYour kind letter of Dec. 23, with the £81 over, has safely reached me. I thank you, dear Pall Mall Gazette, & deeply thank the donors of the gift—It is accepted, I am sure, in the same spirit in which it is conveyed—And I must add that (while I am not at all in actual want, and have generous and attentive friends here) a money aid like this comes most opportunely to me under the circumstances, and helps \"keep the wolf from the door\" indeed.I am almost entirely physically disabled, but remain in good spirits and fairish health. Almost every week I write a little for pay and publication. Winter is at its height and bitter cold here now, the earth hard and covered with ice and snow, as I sit by my window well blanketed, writing this offhand letter of acknowledgement.God bless my British friends assisters—(from the first they have come in when most wanted)—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Henry Norman, 3 January 1887"
