    "text": "New YorkFeb 25 1868Mr. Walt WhitmanSir Your order for the amount of Binding Was Received You Will Please Excuse us for the Deley[Delay] in not Sending your Books But in Consequence of UnforSeen Circumstances it Could Not Be avoided We Ship you this Day Forty Copies 40 The Ballance Fifty Copies Remain in the Bindery Subject to your Order The Amount Received Was $ 31 50⁄100 CorrectThe sig B20 Still Remains 225 CopiesSept '68—Sent order for 20 copies (for O. S. Felt). So there must be now 30 copies remainingWith compliments ofAbe SimpsonKnowing you to be an epicure in fine work I send you this circular to let you know what is being PrintedA SThe Agathanian Club will shortly begin the issue of original publications, and reprints of rare, curious and old American, English, French and Latin books. The typography will be that of the Bradstreet Press, and will equal, if not excel, the best productions of the Shakspere, Chiswick, and Didot Presses.The objects in view are:1. To enable persons possessed of bibliophilogical tastes to procure at a moderate price, valuable works, produced in the highest style of art, with all possible exactness of text, and of which only a very small number of copies will be printed.2. To stimulate the development of the typographical art in this country to its utmost limit of perfection.One hundred and twenty copies only of each work will be published; one hundred of which will be for sale, and the remainder for private distribution. The paper used will be of the same quality as that on which this announcement is printed; the size medium octavo.When necessary, notes for the purpose of elucidating the text will be furnished, in the form of an appendix, by accomplished scholars.In reprinting old books, the style of the original as regards type and general appearance, will be preserved, so far as may be compatible with correctness and true aesthetic principles. Head and tail pieces, initial letters, woodcuts and other engravings, will invariably be reproduced in fac–simile.The first issue will be a reprint of an exceedingly rare and interesting book, entitled, \"Advice to the Officers of the British Army,\" the authorship of which is generally attributed to Captain Grose, a distinguished literary gentleman of the last century. As a clever piece of satire, this work has probably never been equaled. The precepts it contains are fully as applicable to armies of the present day as to the British army of nearly a hundred years ago. A satirical woodcut, supposed to represent Sir Henry Clinton, General Burgoyne, Lord Cornwallis and others, will be given in fac–simile of the original. The notes and introduction to this work will be written by a well–known author. It will be published on or about the fifteenth of February. Subscribers will have preference in being supplied, according to the order in which their subscriptions are made. Those in excess of the first hundred will be placed upon the list for the second work to be issued, should they so desire.The price will be Five Dollars, paper; Six Dollars, extra cloth, top edge gilt. Subscriptions will be received by Messrs. J. M. Bradstreet & Son, of the Bradstreet Press, 18 Beekman Street, New York, and by Messrs. John Penington & Son, 127 S. 7th Street, Philadelphia. The prices of future publications will be duly announced. They will vary according to the size and illustrations of each volume.New York, January Ist, 1867. Abraham Simpson to Walt Whitman, 25 February 1868"
