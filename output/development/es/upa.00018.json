    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West. Camden, N. Jersey, U. S. America—March 17 '76Dearest friend,To your good & comforting letter of Feb. 25th I at once answer, at least with a few lines. I have already to–daytoday written (answering one just rec'dreceived from him) a pretty long letter to Mr Rossetti, & requested him to loan it to you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully & candidly.My new edition is printed & ready. On receipt of your letter I have mailed you a set, two vols.volumes, which you ought to have rec'dreceived by this time. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.My health I am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better—certainly as well as any time of late. I even already vaguely contemplate plans, (they may never be fulfilled, but yet again they may,) of changes, journeys—even of coming to London, of seeing you, of visiting my friends, &c. My dearest friend, I do not approve your American trans–settlement—I see so many things here, you have yet no idea of—the American social & almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, (at least in appearance)—Don't do any thing toward such a move, nor resolve on it, nor indeed make any move at all in it, without further advice from me. If I should get well enough to voyage, we will talk about it yet in London—You must not be uneasy about me—dear friend, I get along much better than you suppose. As to my literary situation here, my rejection by the coteries—& my poverty, (which is the least of my troubles)—I am not sure but I enjoy them all. Besides, as to the latter, I am not in want. Best love to you, & to your children. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 17 March 1876"
