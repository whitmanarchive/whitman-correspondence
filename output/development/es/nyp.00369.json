    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street cor West. Camden, N.New Jersey. June 17, '751875. My dear Stedman,I have rec'dreceived your kind note, & am pleased that you remember me. I shall select some scrap of my MS. & send you soon. The last fortnight I have had an extra spell of debility & head distress, but feel better to-day. Should you come to Philadelphia come over here, (by ferry from foot of Market st.Street Phila.Philadelphia, very accessible) & see me, & have a chat. I am leisurely preparing a Volume, \"Two Rivulets,' (i.e. Real and Ideal) all sorts of things, prose & (my) poetry. Won't be out though for five or six months. Pleasant in some respects here, for meâ€”but pretty lonesome. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Edmund Clarence Stedman, 17 June 1875"
