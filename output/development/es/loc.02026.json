    "text": "Los Angeles.July 26. 1888Dear Walt:I was delighted this morning to see your handwriting on a package of papers. I infer from that that you are able to be up and have your bed made:—There have been alarming reports about your health in the papers, and I have hardly known what to think. I hope you will be with us many years yet—but I suppose it is vain to expect a complete restoration of bodily power.—I trust you may be fairly comfortable, and that I may see you once more in the flesh. The newspapers on this coast, especially the San Francisco Chronicle (the best of all) are very friendly to you and copy every thing that appears about you in the Eastern Press—I am still struggling to establish myself at the bar here: with fair prospect of success. The probablity is that I shall establish myself permanently here. This is bound to be a large city, and the metropolis of Southern California as San Francisco of the Northern Part of the State.—It is pretty warm here this month, but the nights are always cool and we sleep under a blanket always.—It is a much pleasanter summer climate than Philadelphia or Washington.Yours AffectionatelyCharley328 Mickle Charles Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 26 July 1888"
