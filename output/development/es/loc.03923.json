    "text": "328 Mickle st. CamdenWednesday p m Feb:February 24My dear friend—Thanks for your good letter, which the carrier bro'tbrought this morning, & I was glad to get word from you all.—An artist from New York, from the Century Magazine, has been here the last three forenoons, painting a big portrait of me—he has finished all he wants here, & has just boxed it up & taken it off to N YNew York by express—he is a first rate young fellow, a good talker, & has already travelled a good deal over the world—& he made it all very interesting, telling me this, that, & the other.—I am middling well, but very heavy & nerveless—it is nearly two months now I have been in the house most altogether—I am bad enough—but I wonder I a'nt[ain't] worse than I am—Yes, if the weather & roads are any thinganything like fair I want to come down next Sunday & shall come—my nag is about the same as ever—(lame in hind foot ab'tabout a week ago)—I keep him here in the stable yet—the weather has been pleasanter of late & I get out a little occasionally to the cars or down to the ferry, but I am getting more & more clumsy & stupid.—I got a letter from Herbert G.Gilchrist ab'tabout three weeks ago—nothing new of any importance—they are getting up a little book, Life and Letters of Mrs. G.Gilchrist——I suppose you rec'dreceived Edward Carpenter's letter to me which I enclosed to you some time ago—Every thingEverything goes on as well as could be expected with my affairs &c. We get along the same as ever here, & very comfortable considering. I wish when you come up you would stop here—& tell George so too—I wonder when he comes up & is going around Camden he don't stop here—Tell Ed too—Mrs. Davis is an old-fashion'd Jersey woman, & has been to sea—& as to me, you know what I am——Well I am call'd to dinner—the parrot is yelling away as I close——Love to you & George—& all—W W Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 24 February [1886]"
