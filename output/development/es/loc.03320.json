    "text": "Letters, after this,to—St. Botolph ClubBoston,20th Feb. '88.Dear Walt Whitman,Instead of coming by boat, I came by the midnight train on Friday, & got here about 7 on Saturday morning. Since then I have been to Concord & discussed the New Poetry. The meeting took place after all in Dr. Emerson's house, instead of his father's. Old Mrs. Emerson (who is 85 years old, they tell me,) & Ellen Emerson, formed part of the audience which though small was perhaps as remarkable as any I am ever likely to have. The discussion after my paper, in which Sanborn took a main part, was full of interest, & there was a general agreement with my position, & that part based on Leaves of Grass in especial. Mrs. Talcott Williams gave me on Thursday evening two pictures of your house, inside & out, one shewingshowing you seated by the window; & on Sanborn's suggestion I took these to shewshow to the people at the lecture, who were quite delighted with the glimpse of you thus given.I stayed until this morning with the Sanborns, & found them endlessly kind. They were anxious to hear all about you. Sanborn himself may come to see you soon, when passing through Philadelphia. Yesterday morning he drove me round by Lincoln & other pleasant rustic places. It was so fine that I wish you could have been with us. In the afternoon Dr. Emerson drove me to Walden Pond again; & in the evening I met Channing (who as you know is morbidly shy.) & had a quiet talk at Sanborn's snug fireside, with its blazing logs to make good cheer.With love,—Ernest Rhys Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 20 February 1888"
