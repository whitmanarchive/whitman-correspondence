    "text": "431 Stevens st.Street cor West. Camden, N.New Jersey. Dec.December 17Dear John Burroughs,I have been back here two weeks & over—My Washington jaunt occupied some seventeen or eighteen days, & was a very pleasant one for me—(started out with the idea of a two days visit only)—Am perhaps now lately not so well, but not much different—the gravest trouble is the liver and stomachic business now—Still I keep up about the same, (& get mad at myself for grunting)—Your letter of two days since rec'dreceived. Best love to 'SulaUrsula, & to Jenny Grant if there—My new edition is nearly ready—Two VolsVolumes—will give you early advice of their appearance—only 100 copies issued—Is the Winter Sunshine out? Eldridge call'dcalled to see me on his return home two weeks since. Marvin has gone to England, with a Treas[ury] squad. He has call'd on Mrs. Gilchrist. M. D. Conway called on me. Lord Houghton also. We have great times in this house—a baby has arrived, a fine lusty little fellow, now five weeks old—(he has been named Walt)—just now though he is quite sick, but I opine will get along—The rest all very well, except that my sister, the mother, is part of the time only middling. I hear young Walt raising his song, in the room overhead as I conclude my letter—Love to you, as always, my friend—Walt. Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 17 December [1875]"
