The title page ought to be Democratic Vistasand other PiecesBy Walt WhitmanLeave out \"Two Letters\" (p 315 and partly on p 316)—Leave out altogether the Appendix pieces (pp 339 to 374 inclusive)—And I should suggest to have \"Notes left over\" (pp 317 to 338) come last in the volume, & finishing it. Finally I give you the same privilege over the putting together of this, as my other volumes. (Is there any probability of a second edition of \"Spec: Days\"? Is it stereotyped?)To the Publisher—For this Volume, the Preface, &c. I shall expect £10:10s (same as my other vols) and also 10 copies of the \"Vistas\" bound in roan. I wish the am't of the bill for the 50 copies \"Spec:Days\" (sent me three months ago,) deducted from the £10:10s and when you send the balance, send in P.O. order.Respects & good will to allWalt Whitman Walt Whitman Ernesy Rhys, 11 September 1887"
