    "text": "Washington,Saturday morning Jan 17 '63.Dear Mr Wood, So your generous heart moved you to send the sick and dying young men in the hospitals a handsome little contribution of money (toward $4). I thank you, dear sir, in their name, and in my own, as the organ of your charity. I have distributed part of it in Ward 6, (Dr. Leman, ward surgeon) Campbell Hospitalâ€”and shall to-day bestow the rest in the Patent Office Hosp. My friend, I must meet you soon again.Truly yoursWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to George Wood, 17 January 1863"
