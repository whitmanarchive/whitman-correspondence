    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,2 Sept 1888I am thinking of you a great deal in this lovely September weather, wondering how it is with you, dreaming of that September eight years ago when you were here. In another month I suppose we shall have the two books the \"N.B.\" and the \"C.W.\" Before that time or soon after it I may see you—all looks well for the meter so far and I may be east a good deal looking after it. I wonder how it is we (at least, I) hear nothing these times of Kennedy and his \"Walt Whitman.\" I fear publishers are not smiling upon him—fifty years from now they would be glad enough to get it. I am hard at work on a paper or pamphlet or something or other on the same subject but goodness knows when it will see type—however nothing like pegging away—our turn will come some time I suppose since \"every dog has his day\"Let me hear from you when you feel up to it—it seems a long time since I saw your handwriting or the envelope of a letterWe are all well and we all send love to youI am always affectionately yoursRM BuckeSee notes Sept 5, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 September 1888"
