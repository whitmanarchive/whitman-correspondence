It is to be erected in Central Park, at an expense of $30,000. The sculptor is Henry Baerer, who designed the Beethoven monument in New York and the John Howard Payne statue in Brooklyn. The Goethe monument is to be twenty-four feet high, with a colossal bronze figure of the great German poet at the summit, and four lifesize sitting groups in bronze around the granite pedestal, viz., \"Faust and Margaret,\" \"Iphigenia and Orestes,\" \"Hermann and Dorothea at the Well,\" \"The Harpist and Mignon.\" The cost will be defrayed by the students and admirers of Goethe, with the cooperation of the Goethe Society. EMIN BEY AND HIS WORK In person, Emin is a slender man, of medium height, and tough and wiry figure. He is swarthy, with black eyes and hair. His face is that of a studious professional man, and that impression is heightened by the glasses which he always wears. His attitudes and movements are, however, very alert. He stands erect and with his heels together, as if he had been trained as a soldier. He was always reticent about himself, and his history was knownt ot no one in the Soudan or the Provinces of the Equator. He was supposed to be a Mohammedan. I am not sure that he ever said that he was, but I am quite sure that he did not deny it when I knew him. I thas become known later that he is a German, of university education; but there were many at that time who thought that he was a Turk of extraordinary acquirements. He is certiany a man of great ability in many ways, and of strong character. Just why such a man should have gone where he has and stayed there is hard to see. Probably it was largely force of circumstances and a spirit of adventure. Certianly when he went there there was no prospect of much pay or distinction, and he was actuated by no great philanthropic ardor. Responsibilities gradnually came upon him, and he rose to them. It is easy to see how, in a character like Emin's—sympathetic, reflective and enthusiastic—noble purposes were developed with a noble example before him and great opportunities around him. Emin's uncertain power in a savage land is all tha remains of the late khedive's central African Empire.[Colonel H. G. Prout, in November ScribnerBelmontOct 27 189[1889]To Walt WhitmanI am immensely pleased (tickled) with the result of my little Wifekin Dame Kennedy's visit to you. She has read yr books & Bucke's ever since she has returned. She was finally converted by the impression made by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to=day a tremendous arraingmentarraignment of the Leslie Nutter I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England & America) who stand up for W. W. & love him she says, \"Thoreau thinks he is a great fellow, & I think so, too.\" She says, \"I saw with my own eyes, his nobility & manners,\" &c. She thoroughly understands and approves yr Children of Adam poems, too! Sees their noble purpose.She doesn't need you so much as I did, though, for she has always been a liberated spirit. Her father & grandfather were deists.I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the heart of shams & humbugs. Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital of some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.Just begun to rain. The wooded hills & farmstead slopes give grand spreads of dull=glowing brown; not bright but rich=subdued. Have you had any new cider yet. I \"hant.\"affec.W. S. Kennedy. Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 30 October 1889"
