    "text": "offered for the Sunday Editionabout Walt WhitmanDr Bucke's BookTo the Editor of the SunThe following answer of mine to an article in the Nation of July 26 having been refused publication by that paper, it is sent to you, not in any controversial spirit, but because the facts I give are of current interest, and should be kept well before the American public, especially the New York portion of it. Washington Sept: 1883I suggest that you send it to the N. Y. Sun for their Sunday edition—with the preceding note—Dana I think is more or less friendly— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, [19 September 1883]"
