I have a suggestion to make which will be much more satisfactory, in reference to what you suggest, than what you propose, and will either see you or give you the information before the publication of the number containing it, which will be the 20th of this month.Very likely next week I will be over to see you, or if Mr. Traubel will take the trouble to call in I will explain it to him.Yours TrulyJ.M.
