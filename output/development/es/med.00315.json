    "text": ". . . As to me, I lead rather a dull life here. I wish you were nearer, that we might be together frequently. I do not associate much with the department clerks, yet many appear to be good fellows enough. The contest between Congress and the President is quite exciting. I go up to the Capitol and listen to the speeches and arguments. Sometimes I feel as if one side had the best of it and then the other. Well, my dear comrade, I believe I have told you all the newsâ€”of Eicholtz, the German sergeant with the bad compound fracture, of Frazee and Dr. Smith. Walt Whitman to Anson Ryder, Jr., 16 May 1866"
