VAN NESS HOUSEBurlington, Vt.25, Nov 1884BroBrother Walt.Han is improving although very nervous: I suggested a dress: common, cheap calico one ready made which cannot be procured here: She has two or three cut: one late last spring: others years ago: She is unfortunate, proceeds so far with one, then puts it aside: no service to her now—She managed to wash an old one a few days ago: put it on: She has a craze for painting old woollen table covers, for effect in her small parlor: procured some vermillion for her and gave her a brush: mixed the paint: she covered her arms and hands with it: body of her dress, and some on the skirt: daubs chair backs, and things generalygenerally: I must humor her: her mind must have occupation: I put down her winter carpet on Sun. She is much pleased: retoned her oil cloth: shall black and put up her stove: then I shall run two coal fires constantly. Weather pleasant at times—then furious, blustering—freezing hard.C. L.
