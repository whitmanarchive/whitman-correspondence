OSGOOD & CO., Publishers. 211 TREMONT STREET.Boston,May 12 1881.Dear W WhitmanYour letter of May 8 reached here during my absence.Please send on the copy as soon as you can and we will make careful estimate as to its size, style etc. and give you our views. So far as I understand it, this proposed new edition will supersede all other previously published volumesâ€”am I correct? And please tell me if the plates of the original \"Leaves of Grass\" as published by Thayer and Eldredge[Eldridge] so many years ago are still in existence.I am sorry I was absent from Boston during your visit: I should have been glad to renew the acquaintance I had with you in the old Pfaff days.Yours trulyJames R. OsgoodWalt Whitman EsqMay 12 '81 James R. Osgood to Walt Whitman, 12 May 1881"
