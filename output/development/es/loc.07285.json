    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,21 Dec 1888Your card of 19 came this evening. Yes, I have had all the letters you mention as having written including the circular letter written on scotch title-page of \"Nov. Boughs.\" They have all an intense (sometimes most painfull) interest to me—but whether cheering or the reverse my interest in them and you never flags and I think never will while I am above ground—and if there is self-consciousness beyond the grave (as I trust there is) I expect to take far more interest in L. of G. there (and in all belonging to it) than I ever did or do here. We shall see—at least we will not give up the ship untill we have to.You must be gaining—\"sitting up 4½ hours & getting a little appetite\" that sounds mighty well—I hope to see you in pretty fair shape yet when I go East. By the way, no word from Willy Gurd for over a week now—think he will surely be here tomorrow (saturday) night, at latest—he does not seem to get on at all and this ever-lasting putting off and waiting is most wearisome—but it must come to an end by & by. I never tire of looking at and looking over the big book—it is grandLove to youR M Buckesee notes Dec 24 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 21 December 1888"
