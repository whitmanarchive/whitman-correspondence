The lectures in each week will be eleven; they will be given morning and evening, except Saturday evenings, on the six secular days (in the morning at 9 o'clock, and in the evening at 7.30) at the Hillside Chapel, near the Orchard House.The terms will be $3 for each of the five weeks; but each regular student will be required to pay at least $10 for the term, which will permit him to attend during three weeks. The fees for all the courses will be $15. Board may be obtained in the village at from $6 to $12 a week,—so that students may estimate their necessary expenses for the whole term at $50. Single tickets at 50 cents each, will be ssued[issued] for the convenience of visitors, and these may be bought at the shop of H. L. Whitcomb, in Concord, after July 1, 1881, in packages of twelve for $4.50, of six for $2.50, and of three for $1.25. It is expected that the applications for course tickets will exceed the number which can be issued. Any one to whom this circular is sent can now engage tickets by making application, and sending with the application $5 as a guaranty. For those who make this deposit, tickets will be reserved till the first day of July, 1881, and can then be obtained by payment of the balance due. Course tickets at $15 will entitle the holders to reserved seats, and $10 tickets will entitle to a choice of seats after the course ticket holders have been assigned seats.All students should be registered on or before July 1, 1881, at the office of the Secretary, in Concord. No preliminary examinations are required, and no limitation of age, sex or residence in Concord will be prescribed; but it is recommended that persons under eighteen years should not present themselves as students, and that those who take all the courses should reside in the town during the term.

Students coming and going daily during the term, may reach Concord from Boston by the Fitchburg Railroad, or the Middlesex Central; from Lowell, Andover, etc., by the Lowell and Framingham Railroad; from Southern Middlesex and Worcester Counties by the same road.
