    "text": "Dear friendI've been \"vacating\", &c, &c,—down the harbor loafing. So your letter enclosing \"phiz\" that came some days ago was not attended to. Thanks for the presentment! A right fine looking fellow—but if he could cross the Rocky Mountains or go on a whaling voyage & get a touch of worldliness into him, he'd be all the better. You mustn't enjoy nature too much, but roll in the dirt & tear your britches. Ask your sister if this isn't so!You must have had a sweltering time in Phila—or Camden—this last month—We have been fairly done brown some days.It is 6 o.c. Sat. P.M. I'm tired & fidgety to get out of doors. Have been clearing up my studio, so I can feel a little decent on Sunday.Did I write you I had moved?—my shiping[shipping] apartments, I mean. I'm staying in one part of my studio for a few weeks. So direct all your letters here. 12 Coast St. Room 11—I send you a paper with report of Concord lecture.If this letter goes tonight so you can get it Monday, I must go down towndowntown with it, when I get .So goodbye. Have a good vacation—standing on your head & drinking better milk!!!!!Yours everMorse Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, [9 August 1879]"
