    "text": "328 Mickle StreetCamden New JerseyNov. 19 '86Dear friendIf you feel like it write me soon as convenient after rec'ing this, as it is quite a while since I have heard from you, & I am getting anxious. Nothing very different with me—I go out by my own volition not at all, as my power of walking &c. is quite gone. I only get from one room to another in the house, with effort & very slowly—I drive out fair mid-days—Sleep tolerably—appetite good—digestion so-so—I write (prose pieces) from time to time yet—have one ab't \"Burns\" in N. A. Review for November—(they pay quite well, & Redpath is very good to me)—Have a paper \"My Book & I\" in Lippincott's for Jan. next—will send it you in printed slip—Shall probably get ready my little concluding book \"November Boughs\" this winter or next spring—I enclose Dr Bucke's last, just rec'd—the Heine extract it is possible I rec'd from you, but think not—I found it very interesting. Best Love as always—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 19 November 1886"
