    "text": "BurlingtonJune 1867Walter WhitmanYour letters etc, to your sister are received—and have been duly handed to her—When I peruse her mother's letters to you, and note the infirmity of the hand, I experience considerable indignation at a daughter, who comparatively well, and having ample time and convenience, so far deliberately continues to neglect her obligation to the same, and in fact exhibiting no emotion.But it is only a matter of a time, (or pecuniary considerations how much longer I shall tolerate the personal indignities I recieve[receive].To state the latest: this morning (Sunday) I got up and prepared my own breakfast as usual (and after having went over my garden (until 10 o'clock, I quietly took a chair and sat down to enjoy a perusal of the New York Times. Han occupied another window, in her most negligent manner, peeping through the blinds at church goers; and because I did not look up at every remark and chafed some at the interrogation (which should have ceased) I was attacked with the usual personalities. I threw down the paper indignantly, and seizing my boots and coat retired to the kitchen, and shut the door, to escape further provocation and to prepare to leave the house.But I was pursued there, and could not escape without forcing my way; but I came out of the encounter with the back of my right hand so badly lacerated by her nails, that I am compelled to bandage it. And this is from your gentle seeming, simple seeming sister, who is so plausible and ductile before strangers—I procured her a book from the library, last evening, for her Sunday's reading (a novel) and managed all for her comfort as well as I could.She wound up her most miserable outrageous behaviourbehavior by mean inferences toward a poor child of a girl, who now lies allmostalmost at the point of death and whose has been declining for months—And whose brothers, 3 good, kind hearted men have helped me often (with material aid) in my struggles in this place.I sent a flower to her, the other day, of a kind she had craved when she was in health, and a pupil under my care—And this was referred to—But it is a mean subterfuge, and Han lies—knowingly—She knows how this family has befriended—But Han has no gratitude within herself—and never had any sympathy for me.I never urged her to marry yet I have ever treated her in purest principle. I have nursed her in sickness, made every thing as agreeable and convenient as possible for her household work—taken half a woman's work upon myself. I have struggled within myself and solely. She is too mean. She is unjust—a liar, slovenly at times, without a parallel, for a woman without children. She is for herself, and herself only.I meet with much respect from the citizens of this place, and increasing encouragement—I shall exhibit my hand to a person, with whom she once lived. It will scarcely be credited, the persistent, vulgar and provoking meanness I have so long endured.C. L. Heyde Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, June 1867"
