    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,24 Dec 1889Yours of 18, 20, 21 enclosing letters from Rhys and Burroughs came to hand this afternoon and was welcomed as usual. I rather envy Rhys meeting Henry Harland—H.H. is a man I have considerable admiration of and I shd like well to meet him. I am well pleased that you like your present muse so well and hope he will stick to you and to the massage business which is the great thing for you. Eldridge (I suppose your old publisher of 1860—29 years ago!) must be a pretty old fellow to be getting married? But they say \"there is no fool like an old fool!\" He probably knows his own business best, any how! Is the \"Harleigh Cemetery\" which you mention that one which we used to pass driving out to the Staffords? If so it must be a pleasant place—well laid out and planted by now.Well Xmas is round again! I can hardly believe it. There is no time of the year I like to get over so well as Xmas and New Years—thank goodness this week and next will fix them! I have some writing to do if I could only get at it but there is so much turning up all the time (all requiring to be looked after) that I almost despair of doing anything. Should the meter turn out O.K. I wonder if a poor devil would have more time or less? Well we must scratch along best we can while we are here. I wonder how it will be on our next stage? Shall we still have to toil and moil, work and fight as here? or will the Lord give us a rest?Love to you dear WaltR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 December 1889"
