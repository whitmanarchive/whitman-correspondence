Father has been to the city to day[today] and came home sick with the head-ache, so sick he had to go to bead[bed], the rest of the family are all well I believe I am getting fat myself you won't know me hardly when you see me, evry one[everyone] who sees me tells me that I look so much better and what is more I feel better than I have since I left the farm. Walt I want to see you badly, I don't know weather[whether] I will get to come down Saturday or no, but if I don't get down Saturday I will come down Saturday week, for certain. I was down to see H. Stafford to day[today], he wants to get in J Seca's office for the winter if he can and if H he does it will be good for me, he is well and, at present working on the farm. H.G. is down yet, he will be down for several days by the way he talks him and our folks get along well. Mother thinks him tip top, and it makes her mad if I say anything against him she toled[told] me the other day if I did not want to sleep with him I could go somewhare[somewhere] else for she was not going to keep a bed for me by myself. You will please excuse bad writing and other mistakes for the store is full of men blowing and looking at me and I have to get along the best way I can I will have to stop writing now so good bye for here is G. Tomlinson and I will have to stopEver your tru[true] and loving friendH Stafford Harry Stafford to Walt Whitman, 24 October 1877"
