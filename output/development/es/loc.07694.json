    "text": "BelmontJan 2 '88To Walt Whitman:Dear Friend:—A letter rec'd from Fredk W. Wilson of Glasgow, encouraging me to go on & get subscribers for my \"Walt Whitman,\"— saying that I may announce his name as publisher, & that he will receive subscriptions, & announce that work in his lists.This afternoon I came home early & wrote off a rough draft of a circular for above purpose.When Rhys comes he & I will talk it over.Wd you be willing (I hardly dare to ask it) to send me for two yr book of addresses (sent by Express at my cost)— so I cd send out the circulars? Or shd I have to come on & copy them out of it in yr study?I read to-day yr beautiful little poem in The Century. (I keep up my bibliogr. record always (on the \"Whitman\")]I made a trip to the art museum recently to see Gen. C. G. Loring, the Director, about the bust. Will report later. Baxter has gone to Arizona, & left bust in my care. With heartiest love & greetings & Happy New Years I am as ever yr faithful son, & loverWm S. KennedyMy idea is to charge $5. Or a guinnea for the vol. & print it in good style.Subscribers' names be sent to me and to Wilson, and to Ernest Rhys c/o Walter Scott. (if I cd arrange with Rhys) William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman 2 January 1888"
