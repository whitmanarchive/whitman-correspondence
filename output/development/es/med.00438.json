Jersey.May 7, '75Robert Carter,Dear Sir,Thinking that possibly I might be itemised or briefly biographised in the Cyclopaedia I thought I would send you, (or to Mr. Dana,) the accompanying sketch—some authentic statistics, (as I find I am beginning to be noted, & they make sad work of it sometimes.) Leaving of course the whole thing in your hands, I should like you to get the statistics, the fact-basis, right—(& should you think proper can be further consulted here, or proof sent, &c.)—My book Leaves of Grass as now printed, is in its permanent form—My other Vol. of equal size Two Rivulets, (i.e. of Real and Ideal) will comprise all my other writings, Prose & Verse, & is now being put into type. I am still prostrated with Cerebral & liver affection, but work occasionally. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Robert Carter, 7 May 1875"
