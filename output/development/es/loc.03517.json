    "text": "Highland FallsOrange CoCountyNew York StateSept 5, 75My dear Walt WhitmanJoaquin Miller '75I have been wandering up and down the house and waiting to hear from Lord Houghton so as to get you two together here on the banks of the Hudson, but he has gone on West the other way. He will return this way so soon as he has done the West when I hope to catch him and then if we do not get down to see you you are to try and get up here if possible: Yet it may be that Houghton will not get back till too late for me here. In that case we will try and get together in New York City. I am off to old free Boston on Biz & pleasure and as usual know not when I shall get back: but let me hear from you here for I am very anxious indeed to hear of your health. Do keep up my dear fellow there is lots in the tomorrows for you and I want you to live to see the Great Sunrise. Now you must answer me and send me the proof sheets. By that time I shall have returned and will know more about what I shall do the next month Yours ever Joaquin Miller Joaquin Miller to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1875"
