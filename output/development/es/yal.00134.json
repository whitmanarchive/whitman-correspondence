    "text": "Brooklyn,Nov. 17th, 1868.Walt Whitman Esq.Dear Sir:Father directs me to send to you $1.00 to pay for the Expressage on the watch sent to day[today], the young man who sent it did not understand that it was to be prepaid.Since the Election has passed over, we Brooklynites have no other excitement of that kind till another Election but I suppose in Washington, sightseers are looking for the 4th of March to witness the inauguration of Grant. On which occasion as on all past inauguration days, Washington will I suppose present a lively appearance and if possible I am going after Consulting you & the folks, to witness it. But I suppose that is too far off to speak of now.Regards from folks,Yours very respectfully & TrulyAlfred Wise.Since the Correction of the watch it has run very well, the fault was with a rubbing of the hands against the dial or glass. Hope it will be satisfactory now! Alfred Wise to Walt Whitman, 17 November 1868"
