    "text": "WashingtonFebruary 2, 1872.Dear Cyril Flower,You may think yourself neglected—perhaps forgotten—by your American friend. But not forgotten, believe me. Twenty times during the last year have I promised myself to write you.I am still here at Washington—every thing much the same in my condition as when you made your brief visit here.—I continue well in health & good spirits—& as usual spend much more of my leisure in the open air, than reading, studying, or in-doors at all.I am very soon going on to New York to bring out a new edition of my poems—same as the copy you have, only in one Vol.—shall remain there until about 7th of April—(my address there will be, 107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U.S. America)—Then to return again here (where my address will be Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C. &c.)Your two letters from England duly reached me at the times, & were very welcome.Tennyson has twice written to me—& good friendly letters. He invites me to visit him.I shall mail to you in a few days my latest piece, in a magazine.And now dear Cyril Flower I send you my love—& hope you may not think hard of me for not writing before.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Cyril Flower, 2 February 1872"
