    "text": "Sunday Evening Nov.November'81Dearest BrotherYour Book came last night, I was just delighted I prize it greatly. I shall always keep this one—every single one of the others are gone, the last one you sent Charlie also & he lent them to his friends, and thats[that's] the last of them,—. I said last night that this one does not go out of this house under any consideration as long as I live.Dont you think its got up finely,—I do.It will be sucessful[successful], many speak of it, here. We looked it over all the evening, Charlie taking it, then I. he read aloud (appreciatively) the Song of Myself. I wanted to read the Ox Tamer and others I liked. There is something so touching or affecting in the words, or title, Sobbing of the Bells, (you know you sent to Boston Globe), we were so taken with & glad to get read &c the rest of the poem. Charlie sits here reading your book, he says this book is electrick[electric]. You cant immagine[imagine] Walt how many speak of you to me. I believe every body under the sun knows of you even persons that live far back in the Country. the other day a Lady friend Mrs Barney called that lives back among the Richmond hills away from any village among other things she spoke of a full length picture of you having been painted for a German Club out West, all have something to say of you that is pleasant for me to hear.Some want to see me Walt Whitmans[Whitman's], sister I have not begun to put on airs yet, but I dont[don't] know but I shall soonI was pleased with Mr Luce a Wisconsin Editor that called some months since, he has sent us several of his papers, most all speak of you, I dont[don't] know that you would care for it, but I will send you the first one.Mrs Abbott (an old very intelligent friend that we had not seen for twelve years, used to live here) called yesterday, she wanted your new book should purchase it here if she could, or wait till she arrived in Boston,—I said I would tell you that she wanted you very much to visit her at their farm among the mountains spoke of many things she would do for you if you would come I told her you had promised to come here some time.Walt I am ashamed I did not write last Spring when you sent me that money. You understand how much I do appreciate it,—. For a day or two I could only think how good you was.—And then I never in all my life had money that done me so much good. I have some of it yet. I saved to finish out a dress I wanted for this Winter, this dress will be all that I shall need. I dont[don't] know whatever I should do without you Walt, in many ways always some pleasant supprisesurprise, a paper or magazine letter something or other, all so pleasant to get. Life would be dull without you.That West Hill letter. I think perhaps I know more of those places you describe than the rest of the family, so to me it was more than interrestinginteresting something to keep. Charlie wrote a pleasant letter to Dr Bucke Canada got a kind letter in reply, spoke of you & he taking dinner together in New York, but the best was that you was pretty well Your Nov 1st letter too said you was well as usual, I am so glad, after all the work and worry you must have had. But sometimes we take long walks in the country, we went to day, a mile or so.Charlie has been sketching some this summer out Williston 18 or 20 miles from here we drove out there two weeks ago, the country was beautiful I liked the ride ever so much.he has sent his Williston picture West, he thinks it sold, he will know soon. He sold one there previous for $75, has just now sold a small one $16.—he has some prospects. We have ups & downs, like every body. He sold more years ago, than late years. I think his pictures much better now, people here follow the fashion, buy foreign picturesI am well, I feel better than I did last summer, I worry less if things go crossways.—dear dear brother I hope to live long enough to see you again, I want you to come here more than I can sayWhat a lovely time you must have had in Boston, Walt, socially I mean. your long letter was delightful to get, told me so much your dinner at Emersons and all the rest. I remember I thought you was good to think of me. How many good friends you have, it was all just splendedsplendidI like Dr Bucke, I feel flattered to be ever so little like Mrs BuckeThe Burlington Free Press says you are going to Europe this fall. there is no truth in it, is there. I noticed your long poem, Song of the Banner at Daybreak, in Free Press, a while ago.With me dear Bother every thing goes much the same, new neighbors about us, with one exception Gen Henry, I liked the old ones bestI run in Mrs Griswolds, one of our neighbor's a good dead[deal], she very often speaks of you.if you should build that little house Walt you used to speak of, I shant forget that old invitation I am sorry its so late I cant write to Lou, I wanted to, so she would write to me ever so much love to you dear Walt & George and Lou, and Eddy. I very very often think of himgood nightHan Hannah Whitman Heyde to Walt Whitman, November 1881"
