    "text": "Camden AmericaOct 22 Evn'g[1887]1888?Dear Herbert GilchristYours of the 10th came to-day & is welcome. Every thing goes on much the same here. Quite biting wintry cold to-day after a long stormy spell. I am ab't the same as when you were here—& am sitting by the window in the big chair. Mrs. D is well. We have been feasting on some nice stewed quinces and quince jelly—a triumph of Mrs. D's cookery—we wish you were here to have some—the very color goes beyond all description. I have no doubt the portrait fully justifies all encomiums there, and goes beyond them. —In a good light & in a frame it must indeed appear well—having neither here, & intentionally hung where it would be tested to the severest—Success to the painter of it—& to it (the nobly carnal & ShaksperianShakespearean work)—I have rec'd a nice letter from Herbert Horne—have heard from Morgan Brown, who is well & remains in N Y state—the Smiths are here, & come to see me—Morse is here—has been here every day this week—Mrs. Stafford was here Wednesday, is well, as are all the family—But it is growing too dark to write—Sunday forenoon early—Oct 23—The sun is shining bright—I have had my breakfast (pann'd oysters toast & coffee) & in half an hour I shall start in my light wagon & Nettie for Glendale—you ought to be here to accompany me—the air is full of sheen & oxygen with a pleasant coolness—write soon again. Give my best regards to Ernest Rhys—a synopsis of his \"New Poetry\" lecture has been published here in the \"Critic\"—Well I must be off—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, 22 Oct 1887"
