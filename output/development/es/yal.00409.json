    "text": "Sunday afternoon Feb. 9. 4 o'clockDearest mother,I suppose you have rec'd word from Jeff that poor Mat was sinking, & you might expect to hear of her death at any moment—that she was a very great sufferer when he wrote. I got his letter dated Feb. 5th yesterday—he said he was writing to you same time—He wrote very serious but calm—Mother, I will not write much to-day—I feel so bad about Mat—I am still improving—but slowly though I realize some improvement every day—my head is easier to-day—Walt— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 9 February [1873]"
