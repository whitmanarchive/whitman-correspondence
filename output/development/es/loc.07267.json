    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIO.London, Ont.,9 Nov 1888Your welcome letter conveying the good news that you are \"feeling better still\" is just to hand. You will have got mine before now telling you I had heard from Wm Gurd & that all was O.K., there was a line yesterday from him to Matilda Gurd but nothing special in it. All is right but move slower than we figured on. I am real glad you seem pleased with Ed W. I knew he would suit you or I would not have sent him so far—he was with me here a long time and I know him well—he is just what he looks a good, simple minded, quiet, honest country boy—just the kind you like. (A note just came from Wm Gurd—all well but not yet able to fix a date for me to go East). Yes I got the Phila \"Times\" 27 Oct. only a middling notice—it is suprising to me how little the average reviewer sees—not one of them seem to have the lest idea what you have been driving at this last 35 years—guess it will come all right in the end. Rolleston has sent me a copy of his Epictetus (Camelot Series)—it is exactly what I wanted I have been looking it over and am delighted with it. Have not yet written to thank him, shall very soon. I guess you are going to make more of a recovery than any of the doctors suspected—they did not allow enough for that wonderfull physique of yours—I wish Pardee & O'Connor were making as good a flight—have heard nothing from either of them for some days.R M BuckeSee notes Nov. 13, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1888"
