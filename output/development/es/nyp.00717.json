    "text": "CamdenOct. 10 '89Yr's of 9th just come;—Whittier's poetry stands for morality (not its ensemble or in any true philosophic or Hegelian sense but)—as filter'd through the positive Puritanical & Quaker filters—is very valuable as a genuine utterance & very fine one—with many capital local & yankee & genre bits—all unmistakably hued with zealous partizan anti-slavery coloring. Then all the genre contributions are precious—all help. Whittier is rather a grand figure—pretty lean & ascetic—no Greek—also not composite & universal enough, (don't wish to be, don't try to be) for ideal Americanism—Ideal Americanism would probably take the Greek spirit & law for all the globe, all history, all rank, the 19/20ths called evil just as well as the 1/20th called good (or moral)—The sense of Mannahatta means the place around which the hurried (or feverish) waters are continually coming or whence they are going—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Sloane Kennedy, 10 October 1889"
