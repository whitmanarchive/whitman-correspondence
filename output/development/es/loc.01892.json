    "text": "Bowling GreenFebryFebruary 24th 1867My Dear FriendI was thinking to daytoday whether I had answered your last letter or not but I am going to write you anyhowThe most news at present is about the high water of which we have plenty & to spare even to the big folks at Washington if they need anyThe weather is warm and spring is fairly advanced people are plowing & wheat looks first rate although I am not interested in agriculture I am glad to see things thriving. I have been engaged in the oil business the last year but I find it a losing game and now I am out of employment and floating around & it is hard to tell when I shall turn up & whether it will be upside down or right side up If I had known in time I might possibly have got the nomination for Governor of this state but ex Gov. Helm has beat me. That you know would have been better than lying around idle. Now I must look for something else for a living. I might steal if I knew enough but I have not even the first rudiments of the profession and then it leads to unpleasant things when one gets caught at it I think of going to Nashville this week and can see if I can get work there something from blacking boots down to sweeping crossings I think if Gov Brownlow knew me he would not hesitate to give me a good berth in Tennessee but being of a modest disposition of course I cannot call his attention to my many meritsNow you must not think I am egotistical at all for I am not I am only telling you what most every one knows as knows anything about me It's Sunday evening I'm sitting alone sad & lonely, not a dog to love no one to talk with Time hangs heavily and yet they say time flees quicklyAh it may be I have seen the time when minutes were hours and days but that is gone yes its[it's] near two years since those scenes were past And May God in his mercy deliver us from the curse of war where so many meet their death or are thrown back upon the world a poor miserable cripple a burden to themselves and no benefit to country or friendsI remain affectionatelyyour friendAnson Rider JunrJuniorAnson RiderBowling GreenKyKentucky Feb. 24, '67AnsAnswered March 15, '67 Anson Ryder, Jr., to Walt Whitman, 24 February 1867"
