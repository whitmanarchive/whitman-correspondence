    "text": "PascackJan 12 /74Mr. WhitmanMy Dear SirI received your letter on the 8th, & was very glad to hear from you. I wrote to you, about 18 months ago; I wrote twice, but, as I did not get an answer, I concluded that you had not received them. The I saw in the paper that you were out in Canada, taking your vacation, so I did not write again, not knowing where to direct. I am sorry to hear that you have been sick, but glad to hear that you are getting well again. You asked about my Grand-Mother, she is alive, but, I cannot say well. She has had the Asthma pretty bad, but is not so much troubled by it now. She has the dropsy also. She has not been in bed for nearly a month, & is entirely deprived of the use of her legs.The rest of us are enjoying pretty good health. I have 3 Brothers, Garrie, Georg[George] , & Richard, & one sister, Mary Garrie years old Geo. 10, Mary 7, Dick 13 & Walt 15. Grand-Mother 87. I go to school every day, to the public school. I attended an Academy last winter, but, my teacher went away, so I stopped going thereâ€”We are having a very mild winter, the ground having been bare for a week or two, & no frost in the ground. Uncle George was up here last fall to see Grand Mother, but has not been here since. You wrote me a very short letter, so it would not look well for me to write a long one. I hope you will come up & see Grand Mother & the rest of us as soon as you get abler. We have been repairing the house & have plenty of roomI thank you very much for all you have sent me. I would send you my picture but I want you to come and see me myself.& very much oblidgedYour loving friendWalt.Walter Whitman StormsP.S. Please excuse the writing as I am a very poor writer.Walter W. StormsJan.January 12, 1874 Walter Whitman Storms to Walt Whitman, 12 January 1874"
