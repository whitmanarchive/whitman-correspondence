    "text": "Brooklyn,Jan 8th 1864Dear Walt,The enclosed $5 is from Mr James P. Kirkwood and is the money spoken of in my letter from Copake. The other $1 is from John D. Martin. I mailed you some 3 or 4 Unions to-day directed to the care of major Hapgood as usualAt home everything is going along abtabout as usual, all abtabout the same.A few days ago there came to the house for you the proof sheets of a small book which the author (no name given) wants you to read and give an opinion on  the Circular you find within. The stuff itself is disgusting, the whole of it going to prove that the nigger is better than the white which the fool says over and over again—do you want it sent on to you.affectionately Jeff. Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 8 January 1864"
