    "text": "Jan 31, 1888Richmond.Dear Walt;The month Ends today—I have been here five weeks. How time fugits! I begin to feel restless to begin another seige of work. But mother is plotting ways to keep me here. I should like to stay with her. She has so much to say, & remembers everything of our family life so clearly. And then, she is lonesome. My sister has gone home. My brother is busy in the shop; & the children in school. I hate to leave her with her uncertain step, & to the necessity of sitting alone to brood over the past. She dont exactly see why I can not do my work here. I explain; she understands for the moment; & then returns to the charge next day or two. Still, finally, she accepts the inevitable, and as the old hymn says—\"Puts a cheerful courage on–.\"I am modeling a small bust of her. I tell her she has eyebrows like yours; cheeks like Shillales; and a double wallop under chin like Dr. Holmes. Her eyes have sort of grown together at the sides, so only a round black spot appears. I shall bring on my bust of her when I come. My sister has a great amount of executive ability, and though moral & liberal in all religious matters, almost to the verge of non-believing, she has the bump of discipline & order big enough to serve the German Empire. Mother & the rest of us are inclined to be lax in all such matters. So you see what's the matter when she (sister) is here. But, More's the matter now she's gone, and I assume charge. My brother's wife died some years ago, leaving 3 children. The boy, Henry, 16 years old, spends much of his time since I have been here, \"drawing Walter Whitman.\" I often look in upon you silently, & see you and the room: The sitting room with Mrs. Davis, the cat & dog; robin & bantams. And out beyond, the \"hens and things\"—minus one thing! And so, how is Aunt Mary. Somehow with her croneing and her stealthy, flat footed tread, I can't avoid seeing her among the immortals— \"her back yard when I was a housekeeper and my cellar floor, was always clean enough to eat your dinner on.\" Yes yes; how well she'd keep these golden stairs & pavements of opal & pearl in Paradise! Tell her when she comes around that I enquire about her, & wish her good health & happy days for many years yet—And Mrs. Mapes, & little Johnie, is it? I presume they, (& Johnie's sister) still drop in & sometimes \"take a bite.\" And the other lady & her children—is it Mrs Cady ? No; I never quite got her name.And of course Mrs D. keeps everything in apple pie order. Ah! the blessed old—. Long may it wave!— Long may you wave it!I suppose friend Harned puts in an appearance often. He is quite a remarkable man, I think. As the old puritan preacher Robinson (was it?) said of the \"Bible, \"I believe more light will break out of it when we are free.\" \"or words to that effect. So when H. gets free of his many encumbering, political, judicial (I don't mean just that—can I say lawicial?), calls & duties, as I think he may one day, and finds his way into the serener atmosphere & more congenial line of thought. I expect more & more of the real light within him will break out of him. He has a vast deal of good insights, and seems to select the good things you have done with more unerring vision than anyone I have met.The Smiths are I venture good friends, but I have yet to discern that they know the \"track of the old varmount.\"And Tom Donaldson—a surprising sort of a man—saying so many good things—with insights that don't seem to belong to him (physically viewed.)Well. I am about sending you the Hicks. I shall mail to you to-morrow the engravings & also a little sketch in oil on a box carr that I made from an old photo of a steel engraving brought me by a Mr.Hines who heard Elias preach when he was 10 years old. He says my copy is quite as good as the original. I dont think so myself, tho' it aproximates. You understand I have made two busts of Hicks—large & small. The large one is liked best—the one I send— I want it in time for the Fidelity boys to use in case you lecture for them. And then I would like it on exhibition at the Friends bookstore. Mr. ston's brother has enquired and can arrange that part. In case anyone should like a copy. I should to use this one for getting others cast—replace it with new one.Mr. Schultz, an old Hicksite likes the big one much. He was 16 when Elias came here in 28, & remembers his stopingstopping overnight at his father's. He says he thinks he may find some old letters Hicks wrote about that time. He knows that there were some & he once read them. \"Elias was a great man. A wonderful preacher—why, one Sunday before he finished his sermon tears were coursing down all our cheeks, young & old. His doctrine was the simplest & most effective—all sided, far reaching: the doctrine of the inner voice, this will guide every one who listens to it & follows its teaching, into all truth & goodness.\"As soon as I can I shall see all the old friends hereabouts, & glean such memoranda as they may have for your consideration. The wonder to all is when I meet these saintly old fellows why they are Hicksites: one would suppose they would take a hint from him & stand by their own inner lights. Instead they try to tell me the way Elias expounded the Scriptures. Strange too he should expound scriptures when the Spirit & he were closely intimate. But—Do you hear anything of the bust that went to England? Seems to me they are a long while getting it on exhibition.I hear good reports about the one in B from friends who have been in to see it. But no word as to its being offered to the library.Regards to Mrs. D—And to all \"whomever they are\"Keep \"so, so,\" \"fair to middlin\" anyway, & as much better as may be.Truly,Morse Sidney H. Morse to Walt Whitman, 31 January 1888"
