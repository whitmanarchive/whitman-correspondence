    "text": "431 Stevens st. cor West.1874 or '574?Camden, N. J.Oct.October 13. Dear Pete,I want some things taken out of my trunk, & put in a bundle & sent here by express. I have written to-day to Mr. Eldridge & sent him the key. I have asked him to go into Milburn's between 3½ and 4 this afternoon, & meet you—or if not convenient for you, this afternoon, to-morrow, or next will do just as well, as I am in no hurry——You both go up in my room & get them—I want My old gray suit, coat vest &, (I think there are two pair of pants) My old black overcoat that is laid away in the trunk Black felt hat—(the smallest lightest one) The old buckskin gloves I think some big sheets of very stout wrapping paper, & plenty of some stout cord will do—the directions must be very plain, & in two places—If not convenient to go to day, go to-morrow afternoon, or next.I don't want the freight paid, as I will pay it on delivery here. I enclose a dollar, as there may be some expense—(some little fixings.) Pete, I rec'dreceived your letter this morning, & it was very welcome, as always. I rec'dreceived the Sunday Herald too. I am having a good spell so far to-day—(if it would only continue)—The bundle will come well enough, as it is a short straight route, if you only do it up so they wont[won't] get loose, & put on plain directions. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 13 October [1873]"
