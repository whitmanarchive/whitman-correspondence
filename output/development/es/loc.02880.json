    "text": "50 Marquis RdCamden Sq.Dec. 30, 1874I see, my dearest Friend, I must not look for those dashes under the words I thought were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes. I see how the dark clouds linger. Full of pain & indignation. I read the paragraph—but fuller still of yearning tenderness & trust and hope. I believe my dear love that what you need to help on your recovery is a woman's tender cherishing love and care and that in that warm genial atmosphere the spring of life will be quickened once more and flow full and strong through all its channels as of old, gradually, not quickly, even so. I dare say: but with plenty of patience; with utmost intelligent care of all conditions favourable to health, of diet, of abundant oxygen in the rooms you inhabit, of as much outdoor life as possible, of happy cheerful companionship & all the homely everyday domestic joys which are so healthful in their influences. America is doing what nations in all times have done towards that which is profoundly new & great, that which discredits their old ideals and offers them strange fruits & flowers from another world than that they have been content to dwell in all their lives. But for all that, I do not believe the precious seed is lying dormant even now—everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured & yields a noble growth. Since it is America that has produced you nourished your soul and body, she is silently unnoticed producing men & women who will justify you, who will understand the meaning of all and respond with a love that will quicken & exalt humanity as Christ's influence once did. Still it is inscrutable to me that the heart of America is not now passionately drawn toward the great heart that beats & glows in these Poems—that Drum Taps, at any rate are not as dear to her as the memory of her dead heroes sons brothers husbands. It must be that they really do not reach the hands of the American people at large—that the professedly literary cultivated class asking for nothing better than the pretty sing song sentimentalities which \"join them in their nonsense,\" or else slavishly prostrating their judgments before the models of the past (so perfect for their day, so wholly inadequate for ours) raise their voices so loud in news papers & magazines as to prevent or everywhere check the circulation Jan. 1. The New Year has come in bleakly & keenly—to the inner as well as to the outer sense, with the papers full of the details of the dark fate of the emigrant ship & of the terrible railway accidents. Percy was not able to join us at Xmas (through business,) but I am expecting him tonight. My mother bears up against the cold wonderfully—& even continues to go out in her chair—so Bee's letters are very bright & cheerful—she & indeed all my children enjoy the cold much provided they have plenty of outdoor exercise—above all skating, which they are now enjoying. I too like it, but am so haunted by the thought of the increased misery it brings to our hundreds of thousands of ill fed ill clothed ill housed.—I trust the family circle round you & your nieces at St. Louis, & all near & dear to you are well, and that you have felt the warm grasp of many loving friends this wintry cloudy time my dearest—and that there may breathe out of these poor words a warm bright glow of love and hope & unrestricted trust in the future. A. Gilchrist. Anne Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 30 December 1874 - 1 January 1875"
