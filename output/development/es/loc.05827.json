    "text": "Newport,Aug. 28th, '84.Walt Whitman, Esq.Dear Sir— I have tried in vain to obtain a good portrait of my father for you and am reduced to this last extremity—I must send you a book (which you need not read) containing poor copies of the good portraits that are in some secure, forgotten place among my traps—stored in garret or cellar of my new house where all things are at sixes and sevens. The one as Richard is from a copper plate, taken in England about 1820; the frontispiece is from a daguerreotype taken in Albany 1848—the original is excellent; Posthumusposthumous is from an engraving—taken very early in his career at Covent Garden—which I never saw. I am sorry that I can find none better than these poor reproductions. They give his face before and after his nose was broken, but are badly printed. I trust they will be of service to you. Very truly yours,Edwin Booth. Edwin Booth to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1884"
