The books came all right: I enclose check for them—Phil. Bagenal writes me from London that he has lost your picture by an accident to his house—fire, I presume; & he wants another copy, with your autograph addressed to him. (You remember that I introduced Bagenal to you; he wrote article about you in The Gentleman's Magazine; & he was an old friend of Standish O'Grady, &c. His name is O. H. Bagenal. He is now, by the way, doing well: assistant editor of the St. James Gazette, & private Sec.Secretary of the Earl of Dunraven—When sending the photo. for him, I wish you would send one to me also with your autograph, & one to Dr. Kelly. It will gratify him exceedingly. I enclose the price of the photographs. Good bye. Love to you—John Boyle O'ReillyWalt Whitman John Boyle O'Reilly to Walt Whitman, 5 March 1885"
