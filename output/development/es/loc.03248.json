    "text": "Bath, Pa.,Oct. 11—1889Mr. Walt Whitman,Dear Sir—Last spring I wrote to you informing you that the pupils of the public schools of this place, contemplated planting a tree and naming it in honor of you. But as I did not receive an answer from you, and thinking that my letter miscarried, I concluded to write again, and name the tree of their planting of the next \"Arbor Day\"—Oct. 18\" 1889, in honor of you. I would be pleased to receive a letter from you giving the pupils some encouragement in this grand work of tree-planting—I will read it to them on \"Arbor Day\" which we celebrate one week from today—Hoping to hear from you—I am—Very truly yours—A K McIlhaneyPrincipal of Schools— Asa K. McIlhaney to Walt Whitman, 11 October 1889"
