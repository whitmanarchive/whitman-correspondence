    "text": "54, Manchester Rd BoltonLancashire, England11 August 1891 My dearest Friend, My birthday today. 38. A time rousing many memories, solemn thoughts, & forward reaching anticipations. Most of all, thoughts of my dear mother—\"buried & gone, yet buried not, gone not from me.\" How strongly I have felt that today! I feel somehow that there is indeed obscure & deep communion between us, not to be put in words, yet vital & real. \"Of all earth, life, love to me the best\"—I pledge her dear memory—sacred & precious to me evermore—with you—the supreme lover, my dearest friend, exemplar, & benefactor—as with one who also loves his mother's memory above all else. May God in due time reunite us there, in love deeper & more stainless than of old. How life deepens with advancing years! Miraculous & wonderful beyond all speech, pierced through & through with shafts of light as from heaven itself—a deep & mystic love revealing & unfolding itself more & more. \"Praise the Lord for his goodness!\"—That old time ejaculation of psalmist David is true in every generation—& may be ours today in even greater measure. Deep gratitude from my heart to you—dearest of all friends—for all the light & joy & blessing you have bestowed on me during the last twelve months. You little know all you have done for me! But you have my dearest love evermore. Not only directly, but perhaps even more indirectly, you have deepened the Channels of my life, & filled it with courage & joy. Old friendships you have deepened, & new & blessed ones have come to me through you. I have had touching proofs of this today. From a full heart I pray God to bless my friends, & you their chief. This morning I received a letter—short, sweet, & delicate, from our dear friend Johnston enclosing a bank note for £20 sent to me by \"the College\"—to start me to you. (I cannot come yet, but they mean that I shall come when I can.) Along with it a letter from Johnston in his own behalf warm & friendly, & an illustrated copy of his \"Notes\"—similar to the one he sent to you. Letters, too, from other friends—swelling my heart with emotions almost painful—my dear old friend Fred Wild for instance— & Wentworth Dixon & others. Greenhalgh sent me a book, too, with a note in which he says—\"I am indebted to you for more than I can say. You have—unconsioucly to yourself—answered questions of eternal importance to me.\" Letters, too, from children—two very sweet & loving from Dixon's little girls. \"I'm a proud man the day\"—and I tell you about it, dear friend & master, because I owe so much of it to you. God bless you & reward you. Some of the friends should have come to Anderton to tea with me—but business & other engagements intervened. Johnston however came, and as he had to return soon to his surgery, I came to Bolton again with him, & and write this while he is professionally engaged. Very soon I shall have to start off for the last train home. We were very sorry to see in tonight's paper that you have had a spell of terrible heat in the States—96° at Philadelphia. We are very much concerned on your account. We shall await reports anxiously. My life becomes more & more intertwined with yours. God grant that in the future it may grow worthier, & that I may be enabled to devote such energies & powers as are left me more & more to your cause. I cannot write any more now.—But today— even more than usual—my heart goes out to you with love,& blessing & deepest gratitude & honour. God bless you J.W. WallaceJ.W.W. James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 11 August 1891"
