There is nothing new or special—I am well, & only hope your cold is better—I sometimes think a bad cold is about as aggravating as any thing one can have—I saw Grant to-day on the avenue walking by himself—(I always salute him, & he does the same to me.)Friday forenoon ½ past 11I have been hard at work all the forenoon—it is a cloudy day here, threatening rain—Mama dear, I don't seem to think of any thing to write about this morning—Love to you—& to George & Lou if they are there.Walt.I send you a couple of Washington papers. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [28–29 December 1871?]"
