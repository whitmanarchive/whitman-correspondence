    "text": "Brooklyn, N. Y.May 9th 1863Dear WaltAlthough I know Mr Lane intends to write you to-day and send you a little money yet I thought I would jot you a note. My main object is to ask you if you can possibly hear anything of Lane's nephew (or boy as he calls him) as he has always been with him and Lane loves him like a son)  He belongs to the 20th Conn. and was in the 12th Army Corps under Gen Birney  The letter of his Company I forget but think it was K. Lane is quite cast down about him, mostly from not hearing from him at all. The boys name is \"Horace G. Tarr.\" Dear Walt, if you should by any chance or inquiry come across him or any news from him wont you please write Lane for I feel real sorry to see him so cast down. I see by some of the papers that quite a number of the 20th Conn. are at Washington in hospitalI feel thankful indeed that George did not have to go through the dangers of this battle although we know not what is in store for him where he is. I do so hope he will be spared to us and that he will come home without ever being injired[injured].Everything is moving the same as usual at home  of course we all feel pretty well down-hearted at the news but then we try to look on it in the most favorable light. God only knows what will be the next. I had certainly made up my mind that we should meet with partial success certainly, but it seems otherwise I suppose you are overcrowded with work just now  I cannot see Walt how you can stand it. I am sure that I could never get used to all the scenes of pain and horror that you have to witness  Tis well though that you can do so, for I know that you are doing a great deal of good.I suppose you do not have much time to write home  We do not hear from you but seldom now. I suppose however that as long as we dont[don't] hear, everything is going as usual with you. We have not heard from either Han or George since I last wrote you  I am getting along first rate just now, make quite a little money and every thing goes well  Mother and Mat and Sis and all are well and send love. Write me WaltAffectionatley[Affectionately] Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 9 May 1863"
