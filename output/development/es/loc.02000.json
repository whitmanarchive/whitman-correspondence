    "text": "SyracuseJan 17/67Mr W. WhitmanI do not know but Ben told you that I was in the Lunatic Asylum during the time that himself John & Charley were recieving[receiving] hard knocks for Uncle Sam & his dimes. Well, I do not regret the 15 months that I spent there in two installments.And what a sad lesson I learned there of young America.A line in Leaves of Grass led me to think that you was the very man to get him out of the Scrape, or at least to show him his danger, of which he seemed quite ignorant. In the Asylum I saw \"living bodys\" that had been so badly defiled by forcing semon[semen] thro[thru] the hand as to retain but little of the human.More than half the pacients[patients] in the institutions, are there from this cause, And half of the other half from dodging the noblist[noblest] work of man, because of the expense of raising children, and other imaginary troblis[troubles], or as I once heard a young Baptist deacon say—\"I won't have my pretty wife all tore to pieces having young-ones. Mad as they are in the Asylum, this is greater madness. Could not the coming young American be induced to do this noblest work manfully & womanly if benevolent liberals were to form themselves unto a Society for the purpose of taking naked infants from their mothers bring them up naked, and marry them at the age of about eight years bringing all Sciënce & all human power to their right mating or pairing. Walt my dear friend, there is no investment that will pay like this. Do you See it? If not there is only God & I that sees it.If you do I know what youd[you'd] do. I will not ask you to reply to this, tho' nothing could afford me more pleasure. But I have no right to take what, but for me, would fall to the Soldier boysHenry Wilsonfather of B H Wilson 185 daysP.S. In looking over if find I have rather neglected female young America in my Asylum remarks; Altho' she has no semon[semen] she suffers just as much by quite as prevalent habits as her Brother.H. WP.S.And I do not mean to say that all our young who practice it, they are of all ages in the Asylum up too[to] eighty years; But I think the habit must have been formed in youth.HW Henry Wilson to Walt Whitman, 17 January 1867"
