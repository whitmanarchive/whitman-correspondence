    "text": "Supreme Court LibraryMelbourne1/9/90My dear MasterYour letter has made more vivid still the thrills of gratitude your former one gave us, and if personal attachment is part of the true poet's need, you assuredly have reward. I thank you sincerely for you kindness in forwarding the papers and criticisms, they help so much to give us clearer ideas of you and to see our Walt from other points of view. How we would have liked to have been present at that birthday \"party\" when Ingersoll (here to all of us once, to some of us still. It would do his heart good, much praised as he is & much reviled too at times to hear some of his Australian admirers \"sticking up\" for him, their paladin of sham-slayers.) eulogized you as the papers say. We are anxiously watching the papers to see the drift of his speech. While out in the cathedral-like gloom of an Australian \"bush\", the sameness of the green of the gum leaves only broken at times with the gold of the wattle bloom, the silence only varied by the eloquent warbling of our mocking bird (the lyre bird) or the faint, imbodied, tinkle of the shy bell-bird, or the screech, as of lost souls, of the white cockatoos, I have often, with or without my mates, thought some of Ingersoll's sculptured sentences worthy of being uttered in those sacred glades, and if so on other subjects, how much more so would we think so when treating of you who have made those great gum trees array themselves in such new meanings for us. Our amygdaline (Eucalyptus Amygdalina) once was your redwood's rival, now each, towering over its native forest wafts comrade-greetings to the other, joining in free-fashion \"hands across the sea.\" Those who have felt the awful meaning of our \"bush\", & our desert with its mirages and its rivers swallowed up in sand, and have been self-conscious of that \"forming, intestinal agitation\" in our town-life, have whirred with flywheels, and mingled with miners in drives & on mulloch heaps, have been \"droving\" sheep to the Plains of Promise or the weird \"Never Never\" land, and have wandered from stationto station with \"sundowner\" or hawker, have given a hand to the wharf-laborer bumping and helped him or resisted him in his \"strikes\" for justice or his violence (we have a great strike on here now, the greatest that has ever taken place here: the whole community are involved. In spite of logic and political economy, my whole sympathies are with the workmen. It shows what fellowship can do, when it unites the \"rouseabout\" on the Tropic of Capricorn with the \"sails\" on an Invercargill trader, and stimulates the London \"docker\" to send his subscriptions & his sympathy), have been among children at school, among business people and professional, and scholars, those who have experienced such, are those who are alone competent here, to pronounce against you, and I have never met one such, who has been able to do so: most such, who read at all, find in you their natural poet. Jim agrees with me in this, & says furthermore that every action he does and every set of circumstances he finds himself in, call up some line of yours. Certainly, to me at least, you are a commentary on, and a unifier of the disjointed (to me previously) history of the world. I can best illustrate Ada's experience of you by saying that to her you appeared as a vast mist, which however gradually developed a nucleus, and that again a nucleolus, which last contained all worth containing in the world. Fred's opinion is best symbolised by the rush of the iron to the magnet without knowing why, exactly. You would like his way of liking you, I think. Eve is an uncompromising evemy of shams, and if I may use the expression a slave to Liberty, and as she finds the same in you (as indeed everyone finds everything he wants in you), you are her inspired Book. To all of us indeed you are our \"guide, philosopher & friend.\" I hope you won't think I am trying to flatter, I can't help telling you what we think of you, to anyone else it might be flattery, but it is no high-falutin, nothing but the honest downright truth when I say that you are the greatest who has ever lived, to us all. The tension of an ecstasy, such as a Mohammedan would feel, if privileged to write to & to receive letters from his Prophet, is on me while I write and therefore I can't write as I would wish to—I can hardly think it is not a dream that I am writing to Walt Whitman. Take our love, we have little more to give you, we can only try to spread to others the same great book you have given to us.We have great difficulty in following the movements of \"Your Touchstone,\" but I think you will see him before he will get your greetings to him here. He was busy with John Burns and others in London, the last I heard of him. I am very sorry that Dr. Bucke's book has gone astray: we are prosecuting every enquiry we can in Australia, & so I hope we shall get it all right.After a long \"try,\" we have managed to get \"Leaves of Grass\" into our Public Library (a magnificent insitution \"November Boughs\" is already there): this will do it good I think for the reviewers & critics (your midwives) will be able to get it, and the general reader too.We will do our best to try & get an order or two for you and think we can do it. It seems a pity that you should be getting no benefit of the numerous copies sold here.I am trying to get an essay read before the Australian Church Library Society, I spoke for you there two or three years ago and managed to rouse a good deal of interest at the time in \"Leaves of Grass.\" We are rather a quiet lot and haven't a great deal of influence, but as it spreads, you shall spread too, I warrant you.I have a whole lot of questions to ask you about your poems but deem it better not to, you must be grown up to and are all the better appreciated when that is the case.We had an important event at our place on the 13th ult.—our first little one. We are going to call him Eric Whitman. His mother and he are quite well and she looks so happy.We all send our love and sincerely hope that you are as comfortable as your sad misfortunes will allow you. It is so sad to think that your services to human beings and to nature should have brought such return from both as yours have. The joy with which we receive your letters is flecked with great pangs for your sufferings. And you hear it all like the hero you are. Again, with loveI remain, my dear, dear master,he whom you have called \"comrade\"Bernard O'Dowd Bernard O'Dowd to Walt Whitman, 9 January 1890"
