    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,15 Nov. 1890Your letter of 12th came to hand yesterday—Shall we soon have a chance of seeing the \"Annex\"—\"Good bye My Fancy\"? This then I suppose is to be the end of the glorious Leaves? Well they are pretty complete—I hardly know what could be added with advantage. Next thing will be to incorporate the two annexes into the body of the book so as to make of it what it is—a unit.Have you seen Dr. Thomas yet? has he order'd glasses for you and have you got them? I am anxious to know when you get and use your new glasses and whether they do not make you more comfortable. As for that infernal belly-ache—lasting so long I hardly know what to say about itSurely you must need some medicine and you could not go far wrong to take say six grains of calomel following it in about 8 hours with a good drink of Friedrichshall—unless you are a great deal better I advise you either to do this or send for a doctor—there is no use suffering more than can be helped.I enclose a letter just came from Wallace—want you to return it, the paper he speaks of has not yet come to hand—shall I send it to you when it does come?We have had some days of magnificent indian summer weather—today is dark & cloudy but pleasant stillI hope for some more indian summer before the cold weather sets inLove to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 15 November 1890"
