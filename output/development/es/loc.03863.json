May possibly not feel well enough to come. No special news in my affairs—things much the same old way—Joe has stopt by the window a few minutes. I hear from Herbert & his picture. Also Dr B. Harry was here 4 or 5 days ago. Backward spring here—W W Walt Whitman to George and Susan Stafford, 26 April 1888"
