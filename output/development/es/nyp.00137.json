    "text": "Dear WaltI scribble a few words to you that you may know I received your letter and that I delivered the enclosed one to Gray (not knowing where to find Bloom) on Saturday night. Rather, I left it for him, at his house. I read your letter yesterday (Sunday) at Freds. A Doctor Phillips of the army, a great friend of Charlie Russells, arrived last night and called upon me. We meet at Freds to day at two O.C[lock] and I suppose we will have a big time. I saw Ben Knower walking on Fifth Avenue yesterday escorting his pretty sister. Freitsh sends you his compliments, respects Etc. Etc. Fred and Bloom are both in excellent condition. Fred is now on Wool's staff and is just back from a tour of inspection among the forts down east, including Portland, Portsmouth, Boston, Newport, New London Etc. Etc., firing off all the guns to test their effectiveness Etc. But to appreciate the history of this tour of inspection you should hear it from Fred your self. It is very funnyâ€” When last I saw Bloom, ten days or so ago he was just getting over a catarrah of the . Poor Bloom, he didn't smoke, nor drink, and I presume he was very miserable. As I write a pugilistic duo, in the alley beyond me, have just ended an \"affaire d'honneur.\" The smaller of two wicked, naughty boys, is weeping and wiping a bloody nose on the ragged sleeve of his jacket. The victorious youth is about to throw a small quantity of mud at the conquered one, and that he may not soil his fingers therewith he has picked up a piece of barrell[barrel] hoop upon the end of which he has scraped up the quantum suf. He does not throw with great precision for the conquered person after dodging the first shower from the victors improvised catapult, runs rapidly into his mothers room in the tenement house opposite and finds therein a shelter from the foe. I shall write a long letter one of these fine days Walt and will give you all the news of interest that I can glean.Until then, may all be secure with you, Walt and believe me,Truly Yours Charles S. Kingsley to Walt Whitman, 21 March 1863"
