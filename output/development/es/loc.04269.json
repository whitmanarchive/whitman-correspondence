Am known extensively over our State—as a lecturer before \"Teachers Associations,\" and can arrange for you to give ten readings of your poems, in ten of our largest cities (you, East, would call them towns) at $50 for night—total $500.00—your expenses need not be more than $100, to and from your home here—netting you $400 for a fortnights work. You will confer the greatest favor on your many Western friends by accepting. If the Winter be too severe; could you come in the Spring—say, May? Trusting to hear favorably from you—I am—Sincerely yoursMarion ThrasherWill furnish you the highest references.Proposal for Western Course of Readings Dec.
