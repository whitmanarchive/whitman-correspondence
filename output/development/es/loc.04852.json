    "text": "GleesonWhite Christchurch. HautsEngland.Mar 4. 1889 My dear Sir. The editor of the Girl's own Paper a magazine, circulating about a quarter of a million copies, has asked me to supplement, a series of articles on \"Some Poets Oversea, by a chapter on Walt Whitman. This paper goes to the homes and hearts of the outside public, and I wondered if I dared to ask you which of all your noble messages, you would like specially brought to their notice.In a late work on the lighter forms, known as Ballades, Rondeaus &, the Athenaeum, in a review by mr Theo. Watts, after many columns of kindly notice advised me to turn to your works as antidote—not dreaming perhaps—that in years of study of the petty pretty trifling of the debonair school. Your poems with Omar Khayyaim[Khayyam] were the strong tonic's that kept energy for the enervating work. Yes I who now am asked to speak of you have only Love to guide me, for in very truth, no more incapable mouse ever grieved at the meshes of a lion's net, than I. Yet fresh from new perusal of Leaves of Grass I felt emboldened—to ask this of you—in hope that thereby. I might undertake the immense responsibility with a certainty of at least one correct representation of your gospel. This, & this alone must be my excuse for adding another needless letter to your overburdened table. But, we who love you over here, & the band is growing and earnest are especially keen of late, that no word should reach you, but of estimation & reverence. Faith fully yours Gleeson Whitesee notes Nov. 2 1890 Gleeson White to Walt Whitman, 4 March 1889"
