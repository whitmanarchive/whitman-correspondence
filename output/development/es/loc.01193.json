    "text": "The Wakefield Earth–Closet Co.Advertising Department,Asa K. Butts, Manager,New York,Sept 291876Dear sirYours of the 25th came duly. I hope there will be an effort made by the editors to push C. F. S. to the extremety[extremety] of the law.That he obtained your goods & under false pretenses is perfectly certain to any . I had placed confidence in Him notwithstanding warnings from some friends who didn't like his looks & even up to last Nov. or Dec. I put confidence in him & did every possible thing to help him. In one of those months for example (I can't remember to a day) I offered to pay at least $100 in payment of your claim in cash if he would let me have some property which he had no earthly use for viz some books which had once been in my private library a $150 bookcase which had been in my library 5 or 6 years before I thought of going into book business. He had much more & than he could use without it. In fact had some lying away entirely unused—I urged that it was his interest to pay you entire & secure your new book there , &c &c To make a long story short I used every inducement to make him pay the debts but he either shuffled, evaded or refused to do any thing. I got one of the claims under his solemn promise to give me $25 towards it on a certain day in . He utterly refused to let me have any money on even books which were under exemption laws that I elected to call them to. Since then I have not spoken to him on . One of the creditors is now prosecuting him & paying lawyers fees. His defense is a lie.I wish I could see you to give you all the points. However owing to a of the contract you have an advantage over the other creditors. In one place he binds himself to pay you $200.00 (just what was due Dec 1st '74) In another place he binds himself to carry out all my contracts with you among other authors &c. This last is quite unconditional . The first with other debts were to be paid in four perportions[proportions] as the goods were sold. Now do you know some able lawyer here in whom you have confidence who would make fees in accordance with the times & my (& your) purposes? If so let me see him give him the points & pay enough to begin operations. I will work, as I have done for 3 or 4 years, day & might & sunday, to get justice out of this fellow for myself & my editors. Your case is in the best shape of any of them & it is an outrage that you should not have been paid promptly as he most solemnly & repeatedly promised me you should be. He represented that he had several sources from which to obtain money each of which was quite beyond any contingency—(if you have no better acquaintance here) perhaps the attorney of the suit (Donely & ) above would do. I never knew him till 5 or 6 weeks since but am very well impressed. He is a man of some note, about your age & quite moderate so far in his charges. Perhaps you can otherwise learn of his reliability. The name is H. F. Pultry, 67 William's ststreet However select any fair man & I'll pay the gelt to test the thing whether he can be made to pay up if it is not too much—I have been too hard at work in hoping to pay other debts & support my large family to attend to this before. Now I wish to go into the book business again & I wish to get through with C. F. S. & all the debts he left unpaid. If I can do this without I'll be glad—But I weary you—I don't wish to wait for you to come to N. Y. I want proceedings begun at once. Please let me hear promptly & obligeyoursAsa K Butts Asa K. Butts to Walt Whitman, 29 September 1876"
