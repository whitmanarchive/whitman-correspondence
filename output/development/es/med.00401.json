Direct Walt Whitman, Attorney Gen's Office, Treasury Building, Washington, D. C.—Please keep the remaining 50 copies till I send some order about them.You have overlooked one thing. When I called upon you 2d January, we found a discrepancy in the two lists of sheets on hand—yours had it that Sheet B, 2d consisted of only 225 sheets—while my list had it that Sheet B 2d consisted of 325 sheets—I wish you to carefully count sheet B 2d & inform me how many there are—as it will decide how many of the deficient signatures of \"Drum-Taps\" etc., I will require to finish up the edition. Please acknowledge the reception of this, with check.(check for $31:50 enclosed) Walt Whitman to Anderson & Archer, 19 February 1868"
