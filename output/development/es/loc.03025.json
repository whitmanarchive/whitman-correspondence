    "text": "July 9th '89Well-beloved friend:—Thy card rec'd & welcomed. I too have rec'd wht I tho't rather cheery letters fr. Mrs. O'C. although mentioning her meagre funds. I have offered & agreed to return her $5.00—one of Wm's subscriptions, thinking one of my books wd be enough for her. We have invited her to come out & see us when she passes thro' Boston & may be able to advise & help her. Hope so. The wife of such a Philip Sidney of a man as O'C. demands chivalrous treatment if we wd emulate the virtues of him, so I think & shall act. Am feeling worse in health this summer & spring than is usual w. me.Sl. Kennedy. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 9 July 1889"
