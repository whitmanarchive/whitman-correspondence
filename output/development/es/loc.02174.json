    "text": "12. Well Road. HampsteadLondon, England.9th November 1886.My dear Walt:I posted you six copies of the last circular this afternoon; I think that John Fraser has printed them beautifully, and I told him so. I have received ten shillings from one Richard Colles (A friend of Dowden) which I enclose herewith;— \"You will kindly consider it annual & I hope not only to increase the sum but have great pleasure of sending it for many years.\" This I quote from his letter, enclosing the sum. Colles, then goes on to say something appreciative of my dear mother's Essays; wchwhich pleased and gratified me much. You will be pleased to hear that I have got over my worries in connection with the contract for my Book: Thomas Fisher Unwin signed the agreement last week; and he is now making arrangement with Roberts of Boston to Publish the Book there. Do you know anything of Roberts?I am so sorry that I have finished my Labour of Love, the doing of her Biography has been the greatest imaginable comfort and solace to me,—in a sense it has given me another year of her companionship. To create a small literary monument to my mother & this such an one should be clothed in pretty dress has been my first consideration— & cudos necessarily plays but a fractional part in it: as is always the case— I should be glad to hear form you soon—as soon as you get this. Give my love & best remembrances to them all at Glendale when next you drive down: and tell me a little about yourself —your drives and friends. I am immersed in proofs, correcting at the rate of a hundred pages a week. I have just finished reading Julian Hawthorne's interviews with Lowell, that wchwhich the \"Pall Mall\" series is interested. I have been wondering what you would think of it? If there is anyone you would like me to send circulars to, name him or her, or if you would like to have anymore I will send some more. I believe Rossetti holds still a small amount in trust. With best love and remembrances to my dear old loving Walt Herbert H. Gilchrist. Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 9 November 1886"
