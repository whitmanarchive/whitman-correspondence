Boughs\" has got to 66th page—Have you rec'd the copy from London Eng. copy of \"Democratic Vistas\"? (a pretty vol)—Osler was here last evn'g—goes off for a very few days (somewhere to sea shore)—I have sufficient frequent bowel movements—had a very slim day all yesterday —a little easier to-day—but slow, slow—my head gone—no grip—shall be glad enough with \"Nov. Boughs\" done printed with no discredit—wish it was all done—Love—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 29 June 1888"
