    "text": "10 Spencer Hill. WimbledonLondon.March 8thDear WaltAfter a time of much anxiety about you the papers gave better accounts & we may hope that your last word of promise & encouragment has not yet been spoken to men. I got from Traubel the L. of G. of 1892â€”a noble volume & just such a one as I have wished to possess. My friend Standish O'Grady asks me to address a letter to you. Take, with his, my words of sympathy in your late heavy trial, & of unalterable homage & love. You have given such faith & courage to so many souls that I doubt not your own ride high over all surges of pain & physical dissolution. And I pray that strength & cheer may reach you from those deepest sources which you have opened up for others & set flowing eternally. Goodbye dear Walt, may God bless and keep you in any and every lot that may be yours. Truly your friendT. W. Rolleston Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 8 March [1892]"
