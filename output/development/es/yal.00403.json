I wrote you Sunday which I suppose you rec'd—I may not write again for two or three days—WaltThe doctor has just been here—says I am getting along first rate—will probably be out, and about as well as usual in a week—It is a heavy snow storm here to-day—I have many callers, but they are not admitted—as I don't care to see them—I write this sitting on the side of the bed, after 4—Don't be frightened should you may-be see or hear of any thing in the papers—you know they killed me off once before—it is just sunset—the sun is shining out bright at last— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, [27 January 1873]"
