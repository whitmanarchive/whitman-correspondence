    "text": "Burlington.Oct.October 10 1877Brother WalterI would advise you to write to Han somewhat of an advising letter; what her prospects might be with her brother George: she has recieved[received] very kind letters from his wife, inviting her to visit them.The trouble I have with her is past endurance: She invades my room, with such offensive demeanoar[demeanor] at times, that I am forced to quit my painting and take to the street: and then she assumes jealousy, and during my absence ransacks my papers, trunks and portfolios for scraps of poetry, composition of a date that have past my memory, and these she brings forward and reads to me, and berates me with, applying them to some one individual or other, at the present time, whichever comes into her head; like one possessed by a very devil. I am driven from my bed at midnight, and to the outside, in the piazza, where I sometimes sit, for hours. I cannot submit to it any longer. She smells my coat, when I come home, my gloves, my handkerchief and declares that I have been abed somewhere: Of course I can go to the hotel, and it would occasion no surprise; The neighbours have become so familiar with GenlGeneral Henry, that they will have no communication or intercourse, with her. Half my time is passed in gardening, and portions the rest waiting upon her, from the grocery. A evening she goes out, in the rain and darkness and returns at bed time, with scandal stories, of sexual demoralisation—whoring truly, and she does not take the smallest interest or thought of how I am to mantain[maintain] myself, Keep this shelter over her and the sheriff from fore-closing—she shows nothing but the most uncompromising vagaries—I have lived like a dog—and can prove it. She allway[always] did have some mean provoking uncalled for scandalous reflection.I am sorry to be compelled to give such a lamentable story. It would not appear well in print. She is identified with yourself I shall do the best I can for her. I cannot afford to hire a studio away from the house—I have no support here scarcely—,I am seriously thinking of returning to my former profession, in New York, but such circumstances as I have narrated could only so greatly discourage me. I enclose some papers that she has just raked up, to give you a fair idea of my grievances and her vagaries.CL Heyde Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 10 October 1877"
