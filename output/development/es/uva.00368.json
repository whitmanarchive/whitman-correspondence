Jersey,May 21.John & Ursula BurroughsDear friends,Thank you for the kind reminder that room & breakfast plate are ready— I shall be coming along—will send you word when— I have hardly any thing to tell about my improvement in health—it is certain I do not get really worse—& yet lameness & pretty bad headspells—added to which lately a great deal of pain & oppression in left side—keep me back. John, I sympathise with you in that jolly bother among the bees & the ground, & birds, nag, &c. Such homely ties—& to come in real contact— & have to do with them— The piece I thought might amuse you in the Galaxy is \"Our Neighborhood\" by Lady Blanche Murphy. John, I enclose a slip about Carlyle, the latest news—seems to be authentic— So long, dear friends,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John & Ursula Burroughs, 21 May [1874]"
