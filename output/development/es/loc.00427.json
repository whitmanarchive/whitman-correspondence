    "text": "BrooklynOct 22nd 1863Dear Walt,This morning I mail with this a letter to you from Mother and also a letter to George from Mother. I suppose Mother has told you fully abtabout Andrew. My own opinion is that he will not recover, that he cannot last long. However I think that it is owning more to the circumstances that surround him than to his disease. There is no use trying to disguise the matter, Andrew is very unfortunately situated in regard to his home. His wife, I guess is not one of the doing kind, and posessed[possessed] with rather an ugly high temper. His disease of course makes Andrew fretful and discouraged, and instead of soothing and nursing him Nancy does the reverse. As to his disease I really think that had I the same disease that I could recover from it. However I dont[don't] know. I sincerely wish that you would come hom[home] for a short time anyway. I think that you could do Andrew a great deal of good  In the letter that Mother received yesterday from you, you speak abtabout my having been reduced in pay. I am sorry Mother wrote you abtabout it for it only worries you without doing any good, and another thing it is not like you think in regard to cutting down my wages. I was working for the two boards of Commissioners, one at $40 and the other at $50 per month, and I have got all the work for one board finished (the one at $40) [and?] as the Sal. of the office I hold for the Permanent board (that of Map clerk at $50) is put down in their annual appropriation at $50 why of course I have to get along with it for the present. It is not the meanness or anything of that kind of anybody and they would pay me more if they could and will probably in a short time. I shall get some appointment again from the old board I have no doubt, and soon too. As to the worry part, I never think of that  A man with a wife like I have got cant worry even if he wanted to. Give yourself no thought abtabout my worring[warring]. Something that I have got entirely past. I have every reason to think that the Commissioners (both boards) think well of me, and I know that Mr Lane will ever do everything in his power for me, and I undoubtedly in a short time shall be getting more.In regard to the Pacific R. R. I am real obliged to you. I learned this morning that our friend J. W. Adams was appointed chief and I've no doubt but I could get a place at once on it, yet I think that in the end I will make more by staying where I am but its rather pleasant to have that to fall back on. I wish you would write me  Ruggles sends his regards.Jeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 22 October 1863"
