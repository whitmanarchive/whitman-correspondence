    "text": "Kirkwood N JMonday evn'gevening Feb 18Dear JackI am down here for a few days—Came down last Saturday fore-noon—am with folks I love, & that love me—have had a real good old-fashion'd time, first-rate for me—It is a farm, every thing plain & plenty, & blazing wood fires—in the eating line, lots of chickens, eggs, fresh pork &c: (they kill a hog every two weeks)—You ought to be here with me a day or so—(likely one day would be enough for you, as there is no city excitement or fashions—no sogering—no balls or theatres—but quite lots of gals, & some real nice ones)—I take an old man's liberty of kissing them all, (especially the handsome ones) when I go around where they are—as I have been coming down here off & on for nearly two years & have got acquainted—I go out walking a good deal down a lane & by a beautiful pond & creek I am very fond of—spend two or three hours there first-rate, even this weather, all by myself—I am quite happy here for me—the weather was very fine for two days, but is a little cooler to-daytoday—I can't walk far you know, but I go stumping about & enjoy it—yesterday they took me out on a long ride—went through the piney woods, which I always like—Jack, I thought you might like to get a line from me, from here—Every thing is so different from Market st or Chestnut or Penn st—but there is no difference in your loving old friend & comradeWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to John R. Johnston, Jr., 18 February 1878"
