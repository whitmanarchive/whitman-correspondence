    "text": "Dear Uncle Walt:Lew tells me he has just finished writing to you, and I take the opportunity of sending a few lines in his letter, as a slight token of my affectionate regard for you. I am sorry to hear you have been ill; but hope that by this time you have fully recovered; and that we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you in Washington, where you are so much missed by your intimate friends and the soldiers in hospitals.I am at present rather unwell;—with a billious[bilious] attack—but hope to be up again in a day or two.There was a salute of 100 guns fired here at noon today, in honor of the news from Atlanta, which creates quite a Jubilee.There is now quite a shower of rain falling, and Lew and Bartlett are having quite a time down stairs, while I am up here in our room, alternately throwing up bile, and writing to you. Very interesting, is it not? (I mean the bile - ing affair.)If you have time, please write me sometimes, as I will always be very happy even to receive a few lines from you.Very respectfully yours Joseph Harris to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1864"
