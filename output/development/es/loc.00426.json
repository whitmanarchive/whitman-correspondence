    "text": "BrooklynOct 15th 1863Dear Walt,Mother received a letter from you yesterday  I got one the day before. Mother did not let me see her letter but Mat says that she understands that you say that you think about coming home. I hope dear Walt, that you will come and that soon  I think if you should come just now you might be able to do Andrew considerable good  He is in a very bad way and I really fear, under the present circumstances that he will not last long. Dear Walt I wish that I could do something more for Andrew, but I have to work all the time, almost day and night and another thing I think he would be guided more by your advice than any one elses[else's]  That damed[damned] infernal robber the doctor that he has been with (Andrew has paid him $95 and been getting worse all the time) told Andrew yesterday that he must not come there again till he brought him $45 more. Only think of it. The infernal son of a bitch. I would like to hang him for a thousand years, ten times a second. I dont[don't] care anything about it for the good that I think that he could do Andrew but that he Andrew thinks that perhaps if he could pay him $45 he could do something for him. The very fact that the scoundrel wants the money in advance is enough  Dear Walt do come home if only for a short time  And unless you come quite soon you certainly will never see Andrew alive. Will you write me at once if you can come.Mother Mat and Sis are all suffering from bad colds, Mother particularly I think is failing rapidly. I do so wish that I could see you and have a good talk abtabout family affairs  I am in an awful hurry or would write more. To day I have to go through the whole line of conduitJeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 15 October 1863"
