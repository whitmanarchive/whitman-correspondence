    "text": "1873 Nov.431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N.J.Friday, 28th—2 p.m.Dear Son Pete,Here I sit again by the heater in the parlor, writing my weekly letter—I have just had my dinner, some cold turkey & glass of Missouri wine &c.—had been out to the P.O. some five or six squares distant—but have to take my time—Am still getting along very satisfactorily (for I am now satisfied with things not being very bad with me)—& my strength is undoubtedly better, which, I hope will in time bring improvement in my walking, & in my head, &c &c——The letter you spoke of about Penn. av. in the paper was not by me—In the Graphic of Tuesday last, Nov.November 25, they print a portrait of my beautiful phiz. & a criticism on my books, one of the best & friendliest I have seen yet—if you can get one in Wash.Washington you will like it—if not you may see it at Graphic office, in WashWashington—I have not rec'd any.—Also Monday's, Nov.November 24, Graphic prints my letter about the Capitol—Your letter came Tuesday—As I said before, you seem to have done what was unavoidable in the Rives muss—but I have a horror of bar room fracases & fights—& I know you have too—As a general thing, I don't think it necessary to resent the insults of drunkards or fools, (unless there is something unavoidable in the case)——Did you get the Scottish Chiefs I sent? Good bye, my dear, loving boy—I am doing quite well—I hope this will find you feeling well in health & jolly in spirits. WaltPete I will probably send the shirts early next week by express Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 28 [November 1873]"
