I have begun my annual report and am more occupied than ever but this should not make me neglect writing to you and shall not again. Am real glad to see that K's piece may soon be out. Guess it will begood—Had a letter from Johnston this moment he says: \"This morning an hour talk with Ingersoll and I got his promise and authority to proceed and get up a lecture entertainment by him for Walt's benefit—in Phila I guess—shall I put you on committee?\" Of course I told him to put me on and if all be well I shall go down to the show and please the Lord we will have a grand time of it.All well here—lovely weather—the \"Western Fair\" opens in London tomorrow—the city will probably be very full this week and next we shall have a cheerful time at the asylum, tooyour friendRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 17 September 1890"
