    "text": "Stonecroft or Squirrel preserve or Cat meadow. Belmont Mon / Oct 3. 80 Dear Old Quaker Friend of the horse-tanning sea kings of Long Island: My thorn first writes me a scrawl saying she had a pleasant call on you. After receiving in (once somewhat melancholy card saying that \"they all came\" in on you, preachers & all, I felt rather sorry I asked her to go. But I'm glad she did. She visits always in Philad. at house of her friend Mrs. Leslie Miller. 'Lel' the Husband runs a city school of design up there near Girard College, or nearer the synagogue on Broad St. Well he used to be a progressive man when young & in Boston, wore slouch hats, long hair & read Whitman. But he has grown contempibly conforming, conventional, since going to Philad, married, & 2 childn. He drew those pictures of yr home for my book; but takes the blackguard view of you. My dame laid him out flat after calling on you. She can do such things, is keen as steel. She writes me he will never mention you again to her. He told me once (he is realy good fellow at heart) that he actually saw you in a livery stable, several times!!! I wanted to ask him if that was not the place for an artistling to be occasionally, too, & and if Rosa Bonheur & Meissonier wd n't be apt to be seen a great deal in liver stables.When a poor librarian 'tother day thrust that gigantic snob R.G. White's pitiful perody[parody] of L of G. in my face & thot he had floord me, he said he ahd heard that Edwin Arnold had been calling on you & tried again to like L. of G. &— couldn't—aw!please excuse clipping of Transcripts. I have to do it for my writings now. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 3 October 1889"
