    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,24 Oct 1888I have heard from Wm Gurd. All goes well in N.Y. except that our lawyer has been sick, he is better and the work of taking out the patents will go on now with all convenient speed. Cannot tell yet positively when I shall go East but rather expect sometime next week. There is no doubt Dr Osler thinks you are doing well or he would be over oftener, if he thought you failing or very ill he would not neglect you I am sure. He is an exceptionablyexceptionally able man and we must admit (whatever we may think or feel) that he knows as much about your condition as any one does (including yourself). I do not hear good accounts of your present nurse (Musgrove) and I have just written to Horace about a young man whom I can freely recommend who is willing to go from here and take the place. His name is Edward Wilkins, I know you would like him, he is a real good, nicelooking young fellow, I have known him some years—he is as good as he looks. I expect to hear from Horace at once on this business—I hope you will approve of the change, I am sure you will be pleased with it when made.AffectionatelyRMBuckeSee notes Oct 26, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 October 1888"
