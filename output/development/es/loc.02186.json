    "text": "12 Well RoadHampstead.September 5th 1885.Dear Walt Your letter of August 1st to hand, it was printed in the Athenaeum of Aug 22nd and in Daily News of 24th. A week ago William Rossetti sent off to you ￡21.2.0 and ￡1. sent by Aldrich; this latter is in the form of an American Bank draft, wh Aldrich said should be forwarded to you in that form; I do not know in what form Rossetti has mailed you the ￡21.2.0. This then is an instalment[installment] of the money accruing from the scheme. We have got John Fraser to print a circular reprinting Athenaeum paragraph with a list of names and your letter in facsimile, expect copies Monday morning. Will send a copy to you. William Rossetti and your friends generally were very pleased and glad to get your letter (William Rossetti remarking that it was a very nice letter.) I am very glad dear Walt that you have one good stout friendly Jersey woman in Mary Davis. I trust that you will soon resume your rides over to Philadelphia on the boat. I have just returned from the country, hence a little delay in getting off this note. With best loveHerbert H Gilchrist. P.S. William Rossetti sent you the ￡21.2.0. through the post office. Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 5 September 1885"
