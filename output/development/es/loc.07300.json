    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,12 May 1889It is a perfect Spring day. Bright and not too warm. I have been out about the garden and grounds nearly all day a good part of the day your old friend Norman Mackenzie was with me (he is spending the Sunday here—is on his way home from Toronto—been there for his \"2d intermediate\" law examination—which he passed—he has now studied law 3 years and has 2 more to study). Norman and I had a good deal to talk about you Norman says he remembers you and all you did and said (when he knew you in '80—he being then 12 years old) as well as if it was only a week ago. He remarked that there must be something extraordinary about you to cause you to be remembered in this persistent manner. He is a very fine boy and greatly liked.Your card of 9th came to hand yesterday—I hope you will send me word (as you get it) about O'C., poor fellow I fear he is very sick. I hope he is not suffering much. We must make up our minds to lose him, I do trust however he will not have much pain or suffering to bear. I hope you have been out in your chair. If you could only get out once or twice a day for a short time surely it would be a wonderful relief to you from the dreadful monotony of your life the last eleven months. Be sure and let me know how you get on with the chair.Always your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 12 May 1889"
