    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON, ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,24 July 1888We had a terrible rainstorm here yesterday. Nearly as bad as our flood of 5 years ago this same month (July, 83). No great harm done however and this morning the air is clearer and brighter and fresher than ever. I got your card of 21st yesterday also a few more pp. of proofs (have the proofs now to p. 96). Surely you are a little on the mend—do you not think so? I do wish however you wdwould mend a little faster—it is slow and dull work for you I fear. We are well here, Mrs. B. &c &c still away (as I told you a few days ago) the little children at home very merry. All goes quietly at the Asylum. Not quite such hard work the last few days, am glad to have a little pause.Your friendRM BuckeSee notes July 26, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 24 July 1888"
