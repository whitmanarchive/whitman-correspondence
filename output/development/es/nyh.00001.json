    "text": "WashingtonJuly 27 1863Mr and Mrs HaskellYour son Erastus Haskell, of Co K 141st New York, is now lying sick with typhoid fever here in hospital.I have been with him quite a good deal, from day to day, was with him yesterday & indeed almost every day, & feel much interested in the young man. He has been very sick, & seems to be so now, as I should judge, but the doctor says he will recover. I had a talk with the doctor yesterday, & he says so still. But Erastus seems to me very sick, & I thought I would write to you. He had some one write to you about two weeks ago, but has received no answer.Erastus does not talk much, so I do not understand much about his affairs. I am merely a friend. The address of Erastus isWard E, Armory Square Hospital | Washington D Cshould you wish to write to him direct.Walt Whitmancare Major Hapgood, paymaster | U S A cor 15th & F st | Washington | D CUpon second thought I enclose you an envelope to send your letter to Erastusâ€”put a stamp on it, & write soon. I suppose you know he has been sick a great deal since he has been in the service. Walt Whitman to Mr. and Mrs. Samuel B. Haskell, 27 July 1863"
