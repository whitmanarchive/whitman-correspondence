    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUMFOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,19 Dec 1888EveningYour letter of 16th & 17 just to hand, also the parcel (Revue Independante, Critic, & Palermo papers). The Critic don't seem to have much in it, the Italian papers I am sorry to say I cannot read (but glad to have them all the same for my collection), in the \"R. Ind.\" there is just 8 pp. translation (Faces, Locomotive in Winter, A World below the brine) no comment at all, translation not good (translator did not fully understand the english text). It is funny he did not claim to translate from the English but from the \"American.\" The bundle is all welcome. As to your letter, dear Walt, I cannot say how it grieves me that you have had to suffer so much, nor how rejoiced I am that you can say you are \"decidedly better\"—I pray earnestly that you may keep on the mend now and have at least a good respite and rest; I wish I could get away to see you and stay a little with you—but you have good doctors and I am glad to think, a good nurse. You have also a wonderful constitution and I have great hopes you will make a good rally yet and be with us for many a good day and talk. I had a line from O'Connor (sending me on your letter) he said he had been bad but \"am now better\" which I was glad enough to hear. Willy Gurd not here yet—untill he comes I have no idea when I can get away East about the meter business, and even after he comes I shall probably know very little more about it for awhile for he seems to have no ideas of time at all and his days are weeks and his months years.We are having a mean winter so far, mud (soft & sometimes frozen in to spikes and lumps) dirty snow, bad wheeling, no sleighing—but we all keep well. Love to you as alwaysR M Buckesee notes Dec 21, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 19 December 1888"
