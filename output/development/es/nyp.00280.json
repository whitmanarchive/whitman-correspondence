    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington, Thursday noon April 16, 1868.Dearest mother,Well, it is a dark cloudy day, & raining hard—the darkies were to have a great celebration here to-day, in honor of emancipation—they turn out here in real good style, on such occasions—but it is too wet for them to-day—Mr. Stanbery is quite ill, as you see by the papers—The Impeachment trial still goes on—I went up, that day, but it was very crowded, & the air was so bad, I left, & went off & had a real good tramp, way up Georgetown, along the banks of the river—it is beautiful along there, of a fine day—So you see I am still able to get around.There is nothing new in the office—the same old story—I have rec'd a number of papers from England with notices of my book, there—mostly friendly & favorable—more so than any here—Mother, I am very sorry you have those pains in your face & head—I shouldn't wonder if it was neuralgia—that is a violent inflammation of the nerves of the face & head—Mrs. Mix used to have it very bad—O, I forgot I believe to tell you Mrs. Mix is living yet—she had a very bad spell, but got over it—Mother, I have just got your letter of 14th—& was glad to get it—I havn't seen William Velsor for some time—will tell him when I see him—Mother, I send a couple of papers same time with this—they are not much, but will do just for a change—poor old Uncle John—he is failing then at last—I suppose George is well, & having good times—I see him every day as I have his picture tacked up on the door of my desk in front—Good bye, dearest mother, & take good care of yourself, & dont work too hard.Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 16 April 1868"
