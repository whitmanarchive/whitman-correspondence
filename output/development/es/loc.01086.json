    "text": "1617 Chestnut StPhiladelphiaJune 10th 85Walt WhitmanDear Sir,I have just picked out of my \"pocket Coleridge\" your letter of a year ago, published in the papers and which I cut out when I was living in New York. I looked it up the other day to see if your birthday was the 30th of May, for I would please myself with the idea that when the ephemera of the ruthless old camp life was gone out of present view—when we are no longer \"crowd the mournery\" of this generation, and they are all \"gone and done joined\" with their dead—I should be glad to realize the substitution for the forgotten, the name of that one which alone would deserve the national festival & sacrifice—the immemorial feast of the bards—the May Morris—Baal-Tinne as our commemoration of the Poet of the Leaves of Grass. Today, on receiving a request from the West for a copy of your poems, I looked up the letter to get your address. It seems to me also that the manner of the request might please you, so I sent a sheet from the letter. It indicates the edition you \"intend to stand by—with some indication also that there are those who will stand with you, in the most sanctified recesses of our best households—without \"expurgation.\" I have my self the same thin green covered quarto, your own edition—which you gave me personally not long after its first appearance. I came to meet you by request of a very manly friend, Sinclair Toussey, at his news stand (the great American News Co of today) then behind the Herald office in Nassau street, where my old master Bennett founded the independent press on the head of an empty barrel. I met you with momentary embarrassment and incredulity—but a few moments My sister learnt to read and understand you about as soon as I did and it has been a sort of propaganda with both of us to give away all the copies of your books we could get, to those whom we thought would appreciate their priceless worth, as the gospel of pure and sober joy serene. You will not remember me by name, although I enjoyed your friendly consideration— before the war—I have pound vast volumes of type matter on the people of these states since, and led them and their leaders about like bee-swarms with noise of cowbells or other clatter. I want a little repose and came here to the Friendly City. Some go to Europe, but these states are good enough for me—especially the \"friendly city.\" I have what is called success; made a good swath of greenback fodder to leave to my two children. Have ten or fifteen years of better work in me yet with good health & clearer brain & spirits than ever. I send you $10.00 for the copy to send west, of your poems—and my photograph too if you recollect me.Carolan O'Brien Bryant Carolan O'Brien Bryant to Walt Whitman, 10 June 1885"
