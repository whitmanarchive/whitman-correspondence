    "text": "May 9, 1889.1015 O St. N. W.Dear Walt,The sad end is come. William passed peacefully to rest at 2 A. M. this day. He failed very much the last week, & more on Sunday, & from that day on.It is sad because he so wanted to get well, & to the last thought he was going to recover.But he lies now the image of perfect rest & peace, & more beautiful than I ever saw him, & looks as he did when I knew him first so long ago, & the late loss of flesh in the face has brought back the very look of youth.Will you kindly inform Dr. Bucke? I can not write him yet.I am indeed alone, both children, my father & mother, all four of my brothers are gone. What a group to welcome me when I shall join them!Last Sunday was the anniversary of our darling Jeannie's passing on, & I almost thought William would go that very day.As everâ€”Nelly O'Connor. Ellen M. O'Connor to Walt Whitman, 9 May 1889"
