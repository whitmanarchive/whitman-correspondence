Mother and Father are sorry they did not get to see you. I was born the first year of the war so I dont know very much about in your book is about the first book I have read about the war. having quite a temperance agitation in our Neighborhood there was 250 signed the Pledge but I cannot tell how long they will keep it I hope our present Goverenor[Governor] will be our next President. if the Democrats get up a muss I am ready to sholder[shoulder] my musket I have read some of your book since I got it and it very interesting. I wrote some time ago to Aunt Jennie not knowing her address I first put it in care of John Johnston Street I did not number. I am very busy now I go to day school 5 days of a week at a Bookkeeping school in one week so I havent time to write. I am ing what to say to make a letter but I dont think I make it.
