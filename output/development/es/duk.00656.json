Y.Sept. 24.My dear friend,I am here a while on leave—am in good health as usual—have been engaged in electrotyping a new edition of my book in better form—You sent me word a year or more ago of some Boston publisher, or bookseller, who was willing (or perhaps wished) to sell my book—Who was it?—I should like to have some such man there—to sell the book on commission, & be agent, depositor, &c—He will be under no expense, of course & will only receive the books from me on sale—I wish to put his name in an advertisement list of agents—Please answer forthwith—direct to me here.Yours as everWalt WhitmanNo objection to a couple of such Boston bookselling places—as agencies. Love to the son, dear boy. Walt Whitman to John T. Trowbridge, 24 September [1870]"
