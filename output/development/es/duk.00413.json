Walt.Han just recieved your letter, with kind enclosure of 1 dollar for herself. Success of your book abroad gives great satisfaction. She is not very strong, but does her best, and very much. I am embarressed[embarrassed] at times greatly to procure necessaries for house—coal etc—Weather has been very unusually cold—is warmer now— Mrs Tyler made us a visit—saw your card/postal, and was surprised at the vigor of your handwriting. I thought Mr Bucke might purchase a picture of Canada Chute, could he see one, for his enthusiasm and enduring regard for you (to help us) but I did not write—one grows desperate under difficulties you know, and my apprehension about our home and home has made me despondent. I now carry a painting out, and get what I can for it—bad business regarding prices.C. L. Heyde Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 2 March 1889"
