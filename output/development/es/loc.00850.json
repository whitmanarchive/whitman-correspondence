    "text": "Olive N.Y.June 28th[1864]Dear Walt,It was my purpose to write to you while home, but ill health prevented me from fulfilling half my plans. I am much better now but by no means well. The Comptroller has given me another week of grace in which time I hope to get well. I have just recd a letter from Benton saying I must come and see him and bring you with me. This is why I am writing. Can you not come. If you are in N.Y. surely you can. Benton would be delighted; so should I. I shall leave go to Benton next Saturday and stay till Wednesday. If you could not come till Monday or Tuesday even, do so. From N.Y. you will take the Harlem R.R. to Amenia, Dutches Co. Benton lives about a mile from there and keeps the Leedsville P.O. If you should write direct to Leedsville N.Y. With much loveI am yours trulyJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 28 June 1864"
