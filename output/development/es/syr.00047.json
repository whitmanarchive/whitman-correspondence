    "text": "[London, Ont.,]30 March [188]9Yours of 27th to hand this morning by mornings mail. So it took from 8 P.M. 27th to 10 A.M. 30th (2 days & 14 hours) to travel from Phila to the asylum, much to long—the postal service is not at all what it should be on this continent—not half what it is in England [/] (I do not know how it is on the Continent of Europe). [—] Yours of 28 also to hand by this afternoon mail (it seems to have done better, I judge it made the trip in just about two days—letters never come in less time than that—they ought to come in a little over a day. I have seen nothing about Tennyson's illness, too bad such men must grow old and die—he is a grad fellow, ought to be immortal (will be, I hope). I get the O'C. cards and glad to get them. O'C. seems rallying finely again and if the fits would only keep off he might have a long pretty good spell—but I fear much they will not keep off for long—seems as if they had come to stay. Am greatly pleased to see that you are going in strong on the massage. [/] I hope for the best results from it. I send you my list of misprints—guess you have them all already—have found no new ones lately—not looking for any—no time. The \"Saturday\" came from O'C. yesterday, read it and was much amused. These polished [mutilation] litterateurs are as blind (half of them) as if they had been born without eyes. Then when others see something they cry out \"nonsense, you only think you see something [/] it is all a delusion there is nothing at all there to see!\" I have written to McK. as follows: \"Please let Mr W. have any copies he wants of my W. W. in sheet or otherwise free of copy right\"Au revoir and Love to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 30 March [188]9"
