    "text": "Inns of Court Hotel,London,W. C.,Tuesday Oct. 3d 1871Dear Walt, I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will bring me to my senses, for I am quite stunned at the first glance of London. I have just come from St.Saint Pauls[Paul's] & feel very strange. I don't know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. St.Saint Pauls[Paul's] was too much for me & my brain actually reels[reels]. I have never seen architecture before. It made me drunkI have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it now. I saw for the first time what power & imagination could be put in form & design—I felt for a moment what great genius was in this field. But I had to retreat after sitting down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel as if I should go no where else while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was not prepared for it & I though[thought] my companions the Treasury clerks would drive me mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them & sit down. Hereafter I must go alone everywhere. My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these things all at once. I would give anything if you was here. I see now that you belong here—these things are akin to your spirit. You would see your own in St.Saint Pauls[Paul's], but it took my breath away. It was more than I could bear & I will have to gird up my loins & try it many times. Outside it has the beauty & grandeur of rocks and crags and ledges. It is nature & art fused into one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It is like a Rembrandt picture so strong & deep is the light & shade. It is more to see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little account, but now I get a glimpse of the real article I am overwhelmed. I had designed to go on the continent, but I shall not stir out of London till I have vanquished some part of it at least. If I loose[lose] my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight. I only wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but shall try to find Conway to morrow. I write you this dear Walt to help recover myself. I know it contains nothing you might expect to hear from me in London, but I have got into Niagara without knowing it & you must bear with me. I will give facts & details next time. Go & see Ursula. With much love,John BurroughsOct 4—I went to day to see Conway but he was not in—so I went back to StSaintPauls[Paul's] to see if I really made a fool of myself yesterday. I did not feel as before & perhaps never shall again, yet it is truly grand & there is no mistake. It is like the grandest organ music put into formP. S. I hope you & O'Connor will really make an effort to come over here. You need not mention it but I know it is not settled at all who will come. This you can rely upon, but there will be no more bonds sent till November. John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 3–4 October 1871"
