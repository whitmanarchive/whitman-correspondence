    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. April 29, 1867Dear brother Jeff,I heard by William O'Connor of the St. Louis proposition—& as far as I could judge by his account—& since by your letter & Mother's—it seems to me best to accept the offer, & go, by all means—It is a great work—a noble position—& will give you a good big field.Jeff, I wish to hear about the family arrangements—whether Mother & Martha &c are going to stay there this summer, or not—(I hope they are.)There is nothing special with me, to write about. In the office, all goes on as usual. I still board at 472 M st. Love to Mat & the little girls. Remember me to Mr. Lane & Davis—So good bye for this time, Jeffy, dear brother. Walt. Walt Whitman to Thomas Jefferson Whitman, 29 April 1867"
