    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,21 Oct. 1888I am reading Cooper's \"Leatherstocking Tales\" over again—have not looked at them for at least 25 years—did not think they were so genuine and good as I find them now to be. We had no clergiman[clergyman] this morning and I have just come in from officiating—reading prayers, bible, sermon &c. Since coming from chapel I have spent half an hour (as I often do) running over \"November Boughs\" \"The Voice of the Rain,\" for instance, one of the most exquisite parables in the English, or any other language. \"Robert Burns,\" I think, a marvellous piece of criticism. \"Last of the War Cases\" one of your most touching pieces, and so on turning the leaves and thinking and dreaming.I thought that by this time I should have been able to say something definite about my jaunt east, but I cannot. Wm Gurd has been in N.Y. since Tuesday morning. but so far I have heard no word from him—I fear something is wrong but cannot think what it is—probably it is nothing serious and when I do hear in a few days more the hitch may have been then got over. I still hope I may leave here say about two weeks from tomorrow (it may possibly be sooner) but I cannot tell whether I shall go direct to Philadelphia or to N.Y. first.Our wet weather still continues, it has rained nearly every day since Sept. 26—the last few days snow with the rain so that the ground has been white at times I look for a fine long \"Indian Summer\" after all this wet, raw, and cold weather.The \"Complete Works\" takes time, a lot of time, but that is all right—take time—enough of it, and have it right—it is worth taking pains about—it will be a standard book for many a day—to many and many it will be a sacred, an altogether priceless volume—a bible of the bibles—a resumé of them all.RMBSee notes Oct 23, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 21 October 1888"
