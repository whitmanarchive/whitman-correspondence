'90 Bro Walt Studio, now, over the kitchen, head of stairS, Octr 8.—Miserable, cold, damp weather— Han about the same: has made a couple of visits, near us, to old acquaintances, who congratulated her, on coming out. Hard times, however. The 5 dollars you sent, put us until yesterday, recieved dollars from Lou—I added 5 cents, all I had, and had a ton of coal sent up; and fixed for winter, wood for the Kitchen stoves, expires in about 2 days, where shall we get a couple of dollars then, to replenish.? You write that you wish Han was near you, she would like it— Charlie Charles L. Heyde to Walt Whitman, 8 October, 1890"
