    "text": "14 Milborne Grove,Brompton W.London, England.Oct. 12.My dear friend,I regret to say that our hopes of getting out the complete and arranged edition of your Poems with O'Connor's Introduction is at present remote. Just as I was beginning to consult about the matter I found that John Camden Hotten had already contracted with W. M. Rossetti to prepare and edit a volume of selections from your Poems. I found that Hotten is not yet ready to bring out the whole work as we would wish. My first feeling at hearing of this arrangement was one of regret. On thinking the whole matter over however I came to think that such an arrangement as that was not without some advantages. In the first place its[it's] a thing which cannot be prevented. Americans have not granted the English any protection for their works or choice about bringing them out, and in the absence of a just law on the subject no one can claim property in his work over here. I may say in passing, however, that in reply to a letter from me to Mr. Hotten he told me that he meant to share with you the pecuniary profits of the venture, and spoke in an honorable tone.Now the advantages I see in the plan of having Rossetti edit the selected volume are these: I believe that it is the best means of paving the way for a public demand for the entire work. The English people are the very ones to desire that which is reserved. Until there is such a popular demand no publisher can be found to print the poems which are now quite extensive. In the next place it is far better, in my opinion and that of your real friends here, that the introduction of you to the general public will come much more gracefully from an English literary man than from any American. No introduction could easily surpass in simple breadth that which O'Connor has written; and some day it must appear; but his reputation here is confined to the few who have read his noble pamphlet, and, which is still more important, it can never have so much effect here for an American to praise American work. It says more for your work that has kindled enthusiasm in the mind of one of another nation, and one whose good judgments cannot be ascribed to personal friendship more than to national pride. These facts together with the assured social and literary position of Rossetti make him of all persons of my acquaintance the fittest I could name to undertake the work. It at once secures the position of your work. The criticism which he wrote in the Chronicle will show you the spirit in which his work will be done, and I know that he is putting a great deal of very careful work upon his introductory essay. I have passed an evening with him. He tells me that his plan will be to divide up the Poems according to their subjects; e.g. \"Poems of Democracy,\" \"Personal Poems,\" \"Poems of Friendship,\" etc. He does not intend to alter any of the Poems he publishes. His volume will I should judge include about one half you have written. There will be footnotes explaining \"phebe–bird\" and other things not known in England so far as he can.Now for some questions he wishes me to ask you: What is Calamus? I could not tell him, satisfactorily, either the exact thing you meant or its metaphorical meaning to you. Again, Rossetti admires very much indeed your introduction to the first edition of the \"Leaves of Grass,\" and wishes to publish it; but he is deterred by a few words. He wishes to know whether you will not send him a word instead of \"father–stuff\" (p. 7, 17th line from bottom) and if on p. 10, bottom lines, you will allow him to alter \"venereal sores or discolorations,\" \"onanist\" and \"any depravity of young men.\" These are the only words he anywhere wishes to modify. The essay is a great one & would have a great effect; but if you do not permit the alterations he will not print it—as he goes on the honorable principle that he has not the right to change an author's language.Now, my dear friend, I hope that on reflection you and O'Connor will think as I do (who am on the ground) that on the whole we had best feel good naturedly toward this plan of Hotten's and Rossetti's. We are not here up to the point yet, but are rising, & this book will help us I am quite sure. The other day the Saturday Review which once ridiculed Leaves of Grass began a review of some American's poems by saying that nothing related to America had appeared in its literature with the simple exception of Walt Whitman's works. The word had its effect. And now goodbye.Let me hear from you as soon as you can, andbelieve me ever cordially your friend.M. D. Conway Moncure D. Conway to Walt Whitman, 12 October 1867"
