    "text": "London, Ont.,26 June 1890I have your card of 23d What's to hinder you writing a little piece from time to time even if you do not publish as written?All the weather prophets here told us we were to have a cool summer to make up for the warm or rather mild winter but so far we are having an extra sultry one. I have seldom seen such a prolonged hot spell in June as we have had lately. And it continues still—nights as well as days are hot.We all keep fairly well however—the grounds are beautiful and the farm and garden looking well. Lots of strawberries these times.W.J. Gurd has finished the model, hope to see him back here within three or four weeks.No news. best wishes to you. So Long!RM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 26 June 1890"
