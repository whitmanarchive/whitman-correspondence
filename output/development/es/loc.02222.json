    "text": "Editorial Department The Century MagazineUnion Square New YorkJune 7, '83.My dear Mr. Whitman:I do not know whether you saw a little paragraph in a recent number of the Critic—in the Lounger's department. I have not seen Dr. Bucke's book, but I was told that he had done me the honor of quoting some verses of mine. I was asked whether those verses were written for the book, or about yourself, and I said \"No—they were published in the magazine some time ago and were suggested by another writer.\" I am very sorry that paragraph appeared as it did, or at all, as it might look as if I were not a friend and admirer of the subject of the book.Are you coming North this summer? I wish you would come and see me at Marion, on Buzzard's Bay in Mass.Massachusetts If you will give me the slightest encouragement I will try to get Burroughs there to meet you. Splendid pine woods—good fishing and boating—a quiet little whaling village. Think well of it and let me know by return mailVery sincerely yoursR.W. Gilder.Walt Whitman Esq. Richard Watson Gilder to Walt Whitman, 7 June 1883"
