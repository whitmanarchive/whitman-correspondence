    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Tuesday, April 30, 1867Dearest mother,I received your letter—also one from Jeffy. I wrote to Jeffy yesterday—I suppose it is for the best that he should go to St. Louis —as it seems to be a great position—I was much pleased to hear that it was Mr. Kirkwood who was the designing Engineer—& also that Davis is to go to St. Louis on the works—Well, mother, about domestic matters—I hardly know what to say at present—Jeff did not say in his letter what was proposed, or how he & Mat thought of doing—I can tell better after I hear—But, Mother, you must not worry about it—it will be arranged some way—There is nothing new in my affairs—I have a little more work these days than usual, but get along first rate—am satisfied with the boarding-house as well as could be expected. Love to you & all, dear mother. I write this at my desk—spring is quite advanced here—it is a damp, misty, cloudy forenoon—but pleasant—I can send you whatever money you need, dear mother, any time—or can come on for a few days—try to take things coolly.Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 30 April 1867"
