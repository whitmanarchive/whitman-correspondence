    "text": "[London, Ont.,]8 Nov [188]9It is after tea (7 P.M.), I am over in my office—gas lit, blinds drawn down, quite snug. Received today \"Le Temps\" and your letter enclosing Kennedy's note all welcome. Do not be uneasy about Mrs Costelloe, she is young and strong and will rally—will probably be better than ever in a year from now and will know enough to keep well next time. If I saw the least prospect of her not recovering I should feel it a terrible calamity—but I do not—she will get well all right—do not be uneasy about that. All well here and all going right. No further word from Willy Gurd but I look for him here within the next 2 or 3 weeks without fail. I note what Kennedy says about the publication of the book (his \"W.W.\") as soon as I get a few hundred that I can spar[e] (and I look for that time to come ve[ry] [so]on now) it is my intention to ad[van]ce the funds required for I am [?] [a]nxious to have K's book pu[blished] and so made safe—put on [?] for good. [mutilation] I have ma[n]y other schemes to go into when the needfull is forthcoming—I am not in a hurry (there is no hurry) if I live I shall see some of them through yet—Who fights for the truth has strong backers—I am not uneasy—we shall certainly come out O.K. in the endBest love to you dear WaltR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 8 November 1889"
