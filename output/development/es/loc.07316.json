    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,20 Sept 1889Your card of 18th reached me at 4 this P.M. The \"Liberty\" with Horace's O'C. piece came at 10 this morning—they are both welcome—With us too it is getting like fall—a fire has looked and felt comfortable the last 3 days. No word lately from Willy Gurd, do not look for him here for some weeks yet. My annual report is on again, shall make it short this year (between you & me—I am not saying any thing about this but thinking of it a good deal—I rather hope this may be my last—if we are not entirely deceived about the meter I shall have other—pleasanter and more profitable—work to do in the immediate future). I note what you say about not feeling very well, Ifear you do not—still, on the whole, you are sticking it out well and have even gained quite a bit in the last 9 months—I have great hopes that you may have some comfort in your life yet—and beyond—beyond? yes, we shall have good times yet—the old times were good but the new times shall be better.I wish I could see you—hope I shall before a very great while—meantime that last photo' is almost equal to the real article itselfLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 20 September 1889"
