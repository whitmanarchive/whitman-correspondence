    "text": "54 Manchester Road,BoltonEngland.Jan 17th 1891.My Dear Old Friend,The American mail this morning brought me three most welcome letters—one from Herbert Gilchrist, one from your dear niece Jessie Whitman, & best of all another kind postcard from you, for which I thank you very heartily—From it I was rejoiced to learn that you were (on Jan 5th) apparently so much better in health—\"comfortable with me still writing a little for publication\"—and in such good spirits.I sincerely trust that this improvement will continue& that there may be no recurrence of your troubles.I shewed[showed] your p.c. to Thos Sharrock in the Police Court where I had to appear as a medical witness this morning & where T S—who is one of \"the Boys\"—is Clerk to the Magistrates Clerk & immediately afterwards I took it to J.W.W.'s office. He shewed[showed] me a long & interesting letter he had just recd from Dr Bucke in which the Dr said that he had dislocated his left shoulder but was getting on all right with it. He also shewed[showed] me the letter he is sending you by this mail, in which he pays a deservedly high tribute to our mutual & much-loved friend Fred WildIn a letter to me Fred says that he takes our gift of L of G as a token & a further Link of Love between us. He also says:—\"I have sent my warmest love to W.W. by Wallace. Do you also remember me. I pray I may become worthy of being one of his friends & lovers.\" This desire of Fred's I gladly forward to you for a more loyal & true hearted friend than he man never had.I am glad you like \"The Review of Reviews\", which J.W.W. have[has] agreed to send you conjointly every month if you will kindly accept of it. The Jan. no. goes by this mail.I also send you a copy—written by Wentworth Dixon—of another good letter I have this week received from J.A. Symonds, which I think will interest youHerbert Gilchrist says (on Jan 5th) that he \"hoped to see you in a couple of weeks\" & I trust you had a good time togetherJ.W.W. has received the paper you sent (Once a Week I think it is[)] & thanks you for itOur second \"glum\" treat comes off tonight—The frost, wh. seemed to be going when I last wrote has returned in all its severity & we have had more snow.This has been a glorious day here—hard frost, & snow with brilliant sunshine & blue sky. J.W.W. & F.W. intended going for a delightful walk in Rivington & much do I regret that my professional duties have prevented my accompanying them.Again expressing the hope that you are keeping better & with kindest regards to all your houselhold & best love to yourself—Yours affectionatelyJ Johnston Dr. John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 17 January 1891"
