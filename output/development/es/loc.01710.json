Vinnie Ream, Vinnie Ream (1847–1914) made a bust from life of Abraham Lincoln, who agreed to sit weekly for the young sculptor. After his assassination she was commissioned to do a statue for the rotunda in the Capitol. When the work was unveiled in 1871, there was some criticism of the first woman to execute such a commission. Reproductions of her sculpture, as well as a portrait by George Caleb Bingham and a bust by Clark MIlls, appear in Antiques (November 1976), 1016–1018.
