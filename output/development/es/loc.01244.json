    "text": "MillthorpeW Chesterfield17 May '90Dear WaltHow quickly the year comes round!—and I haven't sent a word to you I believe since last May. It is too bad. I got the newspaper however with account of your lecture—and I hear there is a poem of yours reprinted in the Review of Reviews which I haven't seen yet. Bucke writes occasionally + gives me news of you.The two Ford sisters and Wm Thompson + R. D. Roberts + myself saw our usual little remembrances, dear Walt—enclosed first of exchange for $203.65 on the Tradesmens' National Bank, Phila—(£42)—with much love + good wishes to you, always the same. Roberts have lately married and sends \"warmest + good wishes + greetings from us both\". The eldest Miss Ford (Bessie) has been very ill for some months (internal complaint) but is getting better now—sits out under the trees. Isabella has written a little novel in Murray's Magazine wh. is quite a success. I am going over to see them in a few days.How do you manage, Walt, about getting out now? Do you get out much in your chair, or are you kept in a good deal. It does make such a difference if one can be out. Have you seen Havelock Ellis' new book on The New Spirit. There is a fine essay on W. W. and the book is intonating all this—but no doubt he has sent it you.We go on much the same here—the social question grows daily + seems likely to absorb all other interests. A new hope in the breasts of the millions of Europe's toiling masses—a new light in their eyes.I have taken up the sandal trade, and make quite elegant leather sandals at 10/6 a pair. Will you have a pair??Send us a line on receipt of this + believe us ever yr. loving friendsEd. Carpenter +c Edward Carpenter to Walt Whitman, 17 May 1890"
