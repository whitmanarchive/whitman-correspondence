    "text": "Nashville Tennessee March 6th '64 Dear MotherWe arrived here last night, and will leave for Knoxville in the course of an hour or two. I am very well indeed and we have had a very pleasant trip out this far. We staid in Louisville Ky. 4 days, boarding at a first rate Hotel, and I am trying to eat enough to last me for a week or two after I get to the front. I found my trunk up at Fort Schuyler all right the morning I left home. Everything seems to be quiet just now in this Department  we are ordered to proceed to Knoxville by way of Chatanooga. I have not written to Walt since I left home but I shall write as soon as we get to our destination. Mother when you write  direct to Knoxville and when you write to Walt tell him to not wait to get a letter from me, but to let me hear from him immediately.How are you all at home  the baby you know was not well when I left, but I hope she is all right before now,  When you write to Han tell her I shall write to her Soon, and if you hear from her tell me all about her in your next letter. I must stop now as it is about time for me to get ready to start. Kind regards to allGeorge W. Whitman George Washington Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 6 March 1864"
