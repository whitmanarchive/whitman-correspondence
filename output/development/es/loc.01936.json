    "text": "CHARLES P. SOMERBY,BOOKSELLERS, PUBLISHER AND IMPORTER OFRadical, Scientific, Positivistic and Oriental Literature,No. 139 EIGHTH STREET,(Few Doors East of Broadway.)New York,Oct. 4, 1875Walt Whitman.Dear Sir:Inclosed find P.O. Order for $10. Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require, and find it utterly impossible to get it. This X is taken from my rent money, and makes us much short on rent. The utter stagnation in the business world, coupled with eight failures of those owing us, and many of the books that were supposed to be sold for cost by my predecessor being returned, explains the situation. Had we not confidently expected trade to be good in September, we should not have made the same calculations we have. We had hoped that you would accept our offer to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our indebtedness to you. Please allow us to do so now, if not too late. Mr. S. is a practical printer and proofreader, and can follow faithfully any instructions you may give. Let us hear from you on this matter, please, at once, if not too late. Each day, we look for a change in the state of trade. We will remit you more at the earliest possible moment. Our mortification at our inability to send more is beyond expression, and we wish we could see you to explain the exact situation.Yours sincerely,Chas.Charles P. Somerby Charles P. Somerby to Walt Whitman, 4 October 1875"
