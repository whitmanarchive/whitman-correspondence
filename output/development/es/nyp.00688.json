He is rather blue—the boy Julian is his great comfort—the \"domestic skies\" (as he terms it) are not fair and happy—I hear from Kennedy—Rhys is there with him & they take to each other muchly—I am invited (by letter from Cortland Palmer, rec'd to day) to go to R's lect: before the Century Club, NY Feb 7, & say a word at conclusion—But of course cannot go—I have rec'd a nice letter from Whittier, thanking me, &c. I hear from Dr Bucke regularly & often—he is true as steel—Has been very bleak & cold here but better & sunny to day—I am quite unwell, but keep up & around & eat my meals in moderation—(an old fellow who comes here said to me as I was eating my supper \"No extremes any way—but eternal vigilance in eating & drinking is the only thing for a sick man or an old coon.\")I want to print a little 15 or 20 page Annex to L of G—Also a sketch of Elias Hicks—but don't know when—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D.
