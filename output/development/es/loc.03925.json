Tho'Though I have nothing new to say particular—I am comfortable & ab'tabout the same generally in health, (but slowly going down hill I suppose.) Ed was here an hour or so last evening, & we were glad to have him. Wish you would come & spend the day here—wish George would come & you & he have dinner here with us—Can't you fix a day soon? Mrs. Davis would be glad too—As I write the little bird is singing gayly in his cage—first rate cheer & company for me, for I am here mostly alone—sun shining to day here, but cold enough outside frozen hard—\"O why past there bleach'dbleached these locks, old Time yet left my heart so young\"? Love to you & George, Harry & all—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Susan Stafford, 18 January [1887]"
