I hope well  Is George busy still on the pipe question  We are having very hot weather for the last few days—On Thursday next Hattie and Jessie depart for Iowa or Wisconsin for a month or two—Jess and Hat have grown quite up and begin to look like young ladies—they keep to school pretty close and study well—Let me hear form you when you can—if matters change here I shall make you a visit for awhile—I should endeavor to get a job in Baltimore as I see they are getting ready to build works there—Love to all—not forgetting EdJeff Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 5 July 1875"
