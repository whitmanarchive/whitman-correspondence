    "text": "Walter StormsApril 26—75PascackApr.April 20 1875My dear Friend, Mr. WhitmanI received your letter by Monday evenings[evening's] mail.I did not expect to hear from you so soon after writing nevertheless, I was just as glad to hear from you, I wrote in my last letter that we know nothing about uncle George. well, shortly after I had written to you we received a letter from him. this was on Friday night, and on the preceeding Saturday I went to N.Y.New York (the first time I had even been there alone). I croosed[crossed] over on 23rd St.Street Ferry, walked to 9th Ave.Avenue and took the cars to W.West 43rd St.Street where I found uncle George at No.Number 35, so, if you will do him, as well as me, the favor of writing to him, you will please both of us, direct to No.Number 35 W.West 43 St.Street I suppose you know Arthur Henry. well, he is keeping the place near the 5th Ave.Avenue Stage Stables, and there is where George's staying. since Papa saw him, he has had very sore feet and legs, so bad that he could not have worked, even if he had had it. they were considerable better when I was there. I got there about 10 o'clock, and took dinner with him, then we went down to Fulton Ferry, with Asik Speer, a 5th Ave.Avenue driver, and a good friend of Uncle George. I guess you dont know Speer, he belongs in Paterson.well, we went to Fulton Ferry, and I was to take boat from Peck's ship to go and out on L. I.Long Island but, the boat was not running, so I crossed from James's ship to Hunter's and look the cars from to Great Neck. I have a cousin living there whom I went to visit. I left Uncle George at James' Ship. I suppose you have read all about the new P.O. in N.Y.New York It is a splendid building and is nearly finished. The Astor house has sold out its old Furniture and everything, and the building itself is undergoing repair the inside and front are all taken out, and it is to be fined up splendid. The East River bridge does not seem to be getting on very fast I believe the pairs are not quite finished. I suppose you have heard that several of convicts have escaped from Blackwells, and Boss Tweed is to be released. Dan Bryant died, a week ago last Saturday.The weather here, is remarkably cold for the time of year, it freezes hard every night. April 16th, there fell 11 inches of snow and people rode with the sleigh, there are no gardens made yet, but I have plants in my hot bed big enough to be transplanted. Papa wrenched his back last Thursday, and has been laid up ever since.I am not much of a young man yet, I am 17 years old, all but a few days, but very small for my age I would not be taken for more than 13I go to school every day, answer soonYours,W. W.Walter Whitman Stormswe got a letter from Uncle George last night—he had no work, and his limbs were not very well Walter Whitman Storms to Walt Whitman, 20 April 1875"
