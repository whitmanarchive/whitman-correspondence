    "text": "West Park N.Y.Jany 13, 1888Dear Walt:Quite a long letter you wrote me: many thanks for it, & for all the items of news it contained. I am glad Abagail[Abigail] called to see you. I urged her to do so weeks ago. I am very sorry you do not get out anymore. Your[You're] right not to surrender in that way without a struggle.I keep pretty well, except a very bad cold lately, but the winter has been a vacant unprofitable one to me so far. My domestic skies are not pleasant & I seem depressed & restless most of the time. I am interested in that Ernest Rhysâ€”wish you had told me more about him. I should like to meet him if I know where he was to be seen. I saw an abstract of a lecture of his on the New Poetry, some months ago, that contained an admirable statement about your poetry. I will go & hear him lecture if he speaks in N.Y.Two of the poems you enclosed were new to me. I liked them much. Your one to Whittier was very happy. A steady snow fall here to-day, the river a white plain. I dislike the winters more & more & shall not try to spend another in this solitude. Indeed I am thinking strongly of selling my place. I am sick of the whole business of housekeeping. If it was not for Julian I should not hesitate a moment. J. goes to school & is a bright happy boy, very eager for knowledge, & with a quick intelligence. He alone makes life tolerable to me.With the old old loveJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 13 January 1888"
