    "text": "March 11Yours of 7th from N.Y. rec'dreceived last night. I will scratch off some suggestions:In composing the letter, let it be brief, and don't mention the subject—or, if you do, just say indefinitely that it is about Abraham Lincoln (which you may do, if you think proper)—I would like Gilder's name on the letter—The suggestion (Gilder's) about 8 or 10 names only—good ones only—should be carried out. About the Hall I leave to your selection (not the very biggest ones, however, would seem to me best)—I would like Whitelaw Reid's name to cap the list—Couldn't the World man, Schuyler (if he is there yet?) come next?Elliott F. Shepard the lawyer, might be a good name.Take [J. H.] Johnston into your councils, in any business and pecuniary arrangements—he is very 'cute and I consider him a true friend of mine.I am particular about the names. Let [Joel] Benton have my letters, take as much as possible my point of view, and he might write to me here.Walt WhitmanPrivateI care little—or rather nothing at all—about Bayard Taylor's or G. W. Curtis's names on the letter. Don't want them. If they get on, let them be, of course—but don't you make any point about getting them. I suppose you understand me.Of course the letters I write you are for perusal by all my friends—Gilder, Swinton, Benton, &c.—but if I write private, it is for you alone. Walt Whitman to John Burroughs, 11 March [1878]"
