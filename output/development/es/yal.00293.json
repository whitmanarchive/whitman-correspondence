    "text": "Boston,Sept 22, 1883Dear Walt:In New York on Thursday I saw Marvin and was glad to hear from you through him.—He said you had not seen the Nation review of Dr BuckesBucke's book and had expressed a desire to do so. So having a copy I cut it out and enclose it. You will see it makes some outrageously false statements about you at which your friends were naturally indignant, but I am surprised that William was green enough to suppose that he could get any reply printed in that organ of the Philistines; and he probably made it so severe as to preclude its publication any way even supposing them to have been suddenly smitten with a conscience. A very improbable supposition.—You have heard that I have finally received the \"grand bounce\" from an ungrateful government. The fact is I have been rather badly treated by an uncircumsized dog from Kentucky, but such a thing was bound to happen sooner or later, and better now than later.I am still in the prime of life, have health, some means and many friends, and if under these circumstances I did not cheerfully accept the situation I should be unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass, with its philosophy of hope and the morning.—I enclose you my professional card. If after a fair trial I do not succeed in earning a living in this way I shall probably drift back into my old trade of Publishing.I hope you are as comfortable as usual, and enjoying as much of life as you describe in some of the later notes in Specimen Days.—I should be delighted to hear from you, and believe me everFaithfully YoursCharley.from C W Eldridge | Boston Sept '83 Charles W. Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 22 September 1883"
