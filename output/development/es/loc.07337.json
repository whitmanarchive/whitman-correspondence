I enclose the note. I do not understand all of it fully but this much is clear that for about $25. a week (which it seems to me we could easily afford) you could be accommodated and provided with every thing—of course before taking any step we would find out every thing and I would visit Johns Hopkins myself—I will write again tomorrow when I get Osler's further letter promised in this oneR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 29 January 1890"
