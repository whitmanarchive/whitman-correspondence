    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon Ontario12 Dec 1890I have your post card of 8th and your good long letter of 8th & 9th. The latter enclosing Mrs Costelloes letter of 28th ult. All heartily welcome and would have been acknowledged before but I was away in Detroit all yest'd'y. We are having today almost a blizzard. The roads were almost bare of snow last ev'g and now its deep-deep. And we are all rejoicing for sleighing is the correct thing here this time of year and if we do not have it we feel badly used. I have the Courier (6th) with long piece abt. tomb—thanks—I was real glad to get it. I have had no paper with picture (you mention sending one—did not come) or was it the mausoleum pciture you spoke about as being \"poor—bad\", I guessit was for it is a poor affair. I have the Critic (29 Nov)—I like the notion of the vol. Your own pieces—Sarrazin, Rolleston, Ingersoll—it will make a most interesting little book. Nothing could be better.Yes, dear Walt, be sure and send me a copy of paper with notice of Jefferson's death—I want much to see it and have it. I shall also like much to have a copy of the talk at Reissers, do not forget to send it me. Abt. Johnston & the $10. Beers gave Johnston $10. on the train (day of lecture) for ticket or tickets—J. showed the $10. bill to Ingersoll & self but I never heard any more about it or that J. paid it over to you or any one else. I explained all this to Horace—he understands it all—speak to him about it. I was very glad to get the letter from Mrs. Costelloe (which you forwarded me)—I never lose interest in the Smiths or Costelloes and always want to hear all I can of and from themWith best loveRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 12 December 1890"
