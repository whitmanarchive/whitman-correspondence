    "text": "United States Internal Revenue,San Francisco,October 8, 1889.Dear Walt,Your postal card was duly received.—I got all your papers and very glad of them. Especially the Boston Transcripts, Critics, Liberty &c—I am glad to see the notices of William that appear occasionally, but they give a very faint idea of the man to those who knew him best—If I had power of literary expression I would try to write something—If you had your health and strength I know you could give just the right touches which would preserve the portrait of an uncommonly gifted mind—John Burroughs might do it but he lacks sympathy I think with certain fiery and vivid types of which Wm. was a bright exemplar.—But perhaps it is just as well. \"The silent organ loudest chants the masters requiem\"—I am going up and down this fair land and watching the vintage \"from which streams of brandy do flow. By which I only mean that they are gathering and pressing grapes in all the vineyards—1000 acre vineyards not uncommon with five tons of grapes to the acre—and from the new wine brandy is largely distilled, we are in the height of brandy making season with which the internal revenue department is largely concerned—Saw your interview with Edwin Arnold and much touched by it.—The applause of other nations, if not your own, begins to be heard in your declining years. May every comfort and blessing gather around you as your steps grow slow brother beloved.—I hope to see you next year.Yours affectionatelyCharles W. Eldridge. Charles Eldridge to Walt Whitman, 8 October 1889"
