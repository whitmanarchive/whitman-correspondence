My opinion that the book is a success (in the most important requisites) is to-day more decided than ever—largely thanks to you. Dr B has been in N. Y. for a month—has been twice here to see me. Did you see my article in Critic of Nov. 24? I have lately sent a little 20 line poem to Harpers—accepted immediately & paid for ($50!)—I am well as usual—write often—W WI sent your letter to Dr. B—he always wants to hear from you— Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 3 December [1883]"
