    "text": "BelmontJune 16, 87W.W.:—of 13 req. I shall at once get over to Baxter. Think & in fact am sure —that O Reilly is no more — owner of the fund than Baxter or I. But he might well be. All he has is the paper of promises & ten dollars or so in cash. Baxter has abtabout $200 or over in cash. I will advise him to collect and send on the whole amount as soon as he possibly can. It wdwould be a good idea perhaps for him to send on now what he has on. I am sure we shall all be quite satisfied with yryour plans, for my part I am pleased that you are going to the matter & take it with yryour own hands for how vital a matter it is to you. There is only one drawback with me, however, and it is that my excuse for writing you is gone. had cunningly arranged that my contribution be my expenses to Camden & board bills be there helping you get domicilled. I was going actually hammer & saw if necessary. I built my own study out in Ohio where a lady used to own As you will not be unwilling to see me though you don't write me to ever come. I thought you might be bored with so many visitors as you probably are. By the way, please for invitation to the Gilchrist see here. I feel very sorry & about yryour health. You had better write me Baxter, as he is chef in the cottage abtabout Thanks for telling me abtabout him. As always yrs affec WS KennedyPS. I have a shrewd guess that you intend to sell or rent yryour present house, & build or buy the new one on the Long Island shore, But I shan't impart my surmise to any one else. How happy I shall be to come & see you when you are in the new house! Egad, think of that, man,—the new house, I mean. Mrs F. has just sent on some plans for a building. They don't seem to know that you are a house builder. 328 Mickle street—Camden New JerseyJune 18Dear SB—I just send Kennedy's letter & write on it what suggests to me impromptu—Yes I am making calculation on a conveniently plann'dplanned & built house & garden, of my own (cheap & democratic) either in the woods or in sight of the sea, where I can haul in & breathe a sane atmosphere & be secure like either for the summers or all the time yet vouchsafed to me. I think it would be best to get all the money-fund in Mrs. F's O'Reilly's K's & your hands (& any others if any others there be) putting it in a draught payable to my order & send it to me here—I feel as if I could suit m wants & tastes better probably deciding & directing the practicality of the whole thing myself—(I am sure you will all understand it.) Show this to Mrs. F and O'R—I wish them to know too how appreciatingly & gratefully I feel abtabout their help—& that I appoint you to fully act as my representative & (if need be) receiver in the matter. As I write I am sitting here by the open window—Birds singing & fine weather—but hot— Herbert Gilchrist of England is here painting a portrait of me to take to E—God bless you & all— Walt Whitman William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 16 June 1887"
