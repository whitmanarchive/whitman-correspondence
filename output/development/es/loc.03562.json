    "text": "Sedalia, Mo.ThursdayFeby 13 1890Dear Walt WhitmanDuring my travels so far away from home; I have often thought of you and especially so when crossing the same territory that you at one time traversed.But you would scarcely know it now, in fact while now in the centre of the U.S. I enjoy the same elegant meals & comforts that would surround me in your city & how happy would I be could I now instead of writing you, just walk as once before into your grand presence & explain the interesting parts of mylate travels together with the immense success I am on all hands meeting withYou I feel will be happy to learn of my success and which is added to occasionally (as while here) with an $800.00 order, I continue west to Denver & Leadville and upon my return during the summer I ask again the pleasure of seeing you when I shall remember you with some thing from the great west in happy memory of your kind attention to me through Mr Wm Ingram who I write occasionally & who kindly answers me & assures me of your good healthAfter my long confinement which in my case & very many others was a gross injustice upon free men I enjoy the varied & grand sight now ever so much and while Beer & music is yet one of my standards & enjoyed by all the West We dont have to go to Prison three years for enjoying thence out here nor should we either in Philada[.] \"That Dog Stokley\"I could laugh while they were hanging the scoundrel while to you & Mr Ingam I return my true & sincere loveâ€”Your Friend ForeverGeo Rush jr George Rush Jr. to Walt Whitman, 13 February 1890"
