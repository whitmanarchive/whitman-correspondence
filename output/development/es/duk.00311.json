    "text": "BrooklynMarch 19th /64Dear Walt,The enclosed letter from George I should have sent you before but have been so busy that I have neglected it  There is nothing particularly new at home with the exception that Mother is not well. She has been very unwell for the last few days. She has a very steady and severe pain, she thinks a gathering or enlargement, in the right side of her chest. For a day or two she was almost helpless. Night before last Mat made her a poultice of elm and it seems to have done her good. I can not get her to allow herself to be taken care of or to take care of herself. She has been very foolish in house cleaning, she has done more work—whitewashing and cleaning—than any man ought to have done. Yet all the talking that Mat and I could do was no avail. I am really fearful that she has permanently hurt herself. If she does not get better by tomorrow I shall have the doctor to see her  Its very provoking to have Mother kill herself so persistently. She is much worse I think than she used to be. She has an idea that she cannot afford to have anything hired. Im[I'm] in hopes that you will make and carry out the idea of coming to New York. I cannot imagine what it is that ails mother. I hope nothing seriousIn regard to the house I belive[believe] its settled that we all stay as we are. I sent for Brown to come up and see me the other evening. He said that if he had to pay more rent he would have to move. That he should like to stay but that he would move rather than pay more  I thought the matter all over—I did not want to take the whole house—I did not want to move—it would not make but a difference of abt[about] a $ per month so I told Brown he could stay and I would bear the increased rent. As it now stands it is as follows  Mother pays $85 per year, I pay $147 per year and Brown $168 per year. I took out an agreement for Mothers and my names at $19 33 per monthDid you get my letter enclosing $5 from Mr Lane. Why do you not write me? is there any reason? I was in hopes that I would hear from you sometime ago.I wrote you to write me a letter to show Mr Worthen of New York. I think we could get some money through him.Mattie and the babies are quite well. The children are both growing finely  If Mother does not get better in a few days I will write you againYours trulyThos J. Whitman Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 19 March 1864"
