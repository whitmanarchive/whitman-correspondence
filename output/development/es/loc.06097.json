Mr Barnett—Mrs. Gilchrist's address is 12 Well Road, Hampstead—You might take this letter, & read her as the latest—As I finish, Mrs. D[avis] brings in (presents from friends) a dish of grapes, & a great bunch of radiant yellow flowers mingled with \"snow on the mountain\"— Walt Whitman to Mary Whitall Smith, 8 September 1885"
