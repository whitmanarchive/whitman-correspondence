In the long \"times gone by\" you may remember me with some other lads who used to sit in your room in Myrtle ave & hear you tell stories & help you drink coffee. There was Joe Heyer, Bill Devoe, your brother Jeff, & others. I remember well the first time I ever saw President Lincoln. You & I stood talking on G St. (I think it was) near Secretary Chase's residence Washington. You said to me \"There goes Uncle Abe, I shall never forget impression it made on me at the time. I saw an article in the Sunday Eagle giving an account of an interview with you at your home in Camden which interested me very much. Joe Heyer loaned me the paper to read it & by the by Joe works for us & we often in speaking of old times, mention the days & times we passed with our old friend Walt Whitman. I am collecting Photos of distinguished Americans & would be glad to get one of yours, if it can be got. Joe has an Engraving of you which he prizes highly. If there is any published will you let me know. I suppose your time is occupied but I should dearly love to hear form you & believe me to beYour old friendSam G. Stanley Samuel G. Stanley to Walt Whitman, 13 July 1886"
