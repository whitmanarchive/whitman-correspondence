    "text": "Coombe EdgeBlue Ridge SummitPennaJuly 30 1886.My dear Mr Whitman, I send you Alys' circular letter and will you please mail it to Miss Nicholson after you have read it. Alys must be having a delightful time, besides going through a most interesting experience. I am spending my summer among the Blue Ridge mountains in a place that belongs jointly to my mother and my aunt Mrs Pearsall Smith. The country is beautiful, and it is always quite cool. I don't know whether you remember a young man whom you met at my Uncles several times Tom Worthington by name. Alys he and I came over to see you once last winter. Both he and I want you to know that we are engaged to be married. I still intend to continue my course at Bryn Mawr College which will be three years longer and then I shall most likely be married. My brother Bond, who is engaged to Miss Edith Carpenter one of Mariechen's Smith College friends expects to be married on the 13th of October, and he and Edith intend to live in Millville New Jersey. I hope, Mr. Whitman that you have not been sick this summer, but I have been afraid that these last few hot days have been hard for you; if you ever have time I wish you would let me know how you are, but this I shan't expect you to do, because I know how over run you are with letters, so I shall have to wait till I come to Philadelphia next October and find out for my self. Tom Worthington is spending the summer with us and he wishes to be remembered to you, he is just at this moment writing a letter to the Nation on the labor question which has been on his mind for some time. Hoping again that you are better I am, very sincerely your friendMary Grace Thomas.Blue Ridge SummitFranklin CoPa. Mary Grace Thomas to Walt Whitman, 30 July 1886"
