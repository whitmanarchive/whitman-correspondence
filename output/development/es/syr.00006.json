    "text": "LondonOct 30, 1871, Dear Walt,I send you by this mail the \"Dark Blue\" containing the second part of Noel's article. I think the illustration horrid. It makes you look like a sick monkey. I wonder Hennessy could draw such a charicature[caricature]. From what Conway said I inferred he had seen it and approved of it. I shall tell him what I think about it. I do not think the article amounts to shucks either. Rossetti said Noel was very much engrossed with politics, and it is evident he is engrossed with something else than poetry to write such a mess! Of course the article helps, but after Dowdens[Dowden's] noble paper it seems ineffectual enough, though Conway seemed to think it the more feeling of the two.â€”I have not seen Conway or Rossetti since I came back from Paris. I shall see Rossetti again but I do not seem to care much about Conway. I doubt if I could ever fraternize with him. He does not impress me as an eminently sincere and loveable person. It may be very cruel for me to say so, but he seems to me like a kind of literary broker, ever on his make, though I have no complaints to make of his treatment of me & it may be if I knew him better I should like him more. Rossetti I am drawn toward, and though my first impression of him was that he was a high flown literary cockney, yet I soon saw that it was of no merit and that he was a genuine good fellow. He praises Prof. Dowden whom he has met and says I will like him. I intend to go to Ireland if possible, though it looks doubtful & now as Assistant Secretary Richardson has impressed me into his service here & proposes to retain me & my party a week or two later that we had contemplated staying. I am at work in the office or Branch of the Treasury Dept here with 4 or 5 other clerks and the beautiful October days are slipping by and I am not tramping about Stratford or up the mountains of Wales or into Ireland as I had promised myself I should be. I have seen enough of cities & streets & art and pictures & museums to stand me all the rest of my days, and am in a hurry to set my face westward. I spent about a week in Paris & got enough of it. I presume I was a little surprised when I went from here, so that I did not relish Paris as I should have done had I came to it fresh. It is certainly a very beautiful city and very clean & tasteful. The ruins are in excellent taste & are the best behaved ruins I ever saw, and the Parisians are the best measured people I ever saw. I think the waiters in the Hotels could give lessons to princes. They bring you fried eggs on a perfumed napkin, and the napkin on beautiful tissue paper & the whole on a china plate (my paper has got mixed up) and one hardly knows whether to face to & eat or to lift up his hands in admiration. Yet from all that I was not deeply impressed with Paris. The aspect of the streets is very monotenous[monotonous]. See one block & you have seen it all. It all seems to have been built the same day & planned by the same architect & the stone were unmistakably all dug from the same quarry. Hence it is not picturesque or quaint or homely like London or grand either: it is brilliant & correct. I was much disappointed in the French soldiers; they are certainly a very inferior looking lot of men; small & dirty & indifferent. I find this is the impression of all Americans I have talked with who have seen them. I believe there are but two more parties coming over with bonds. I hope you & William will be among them. I wrote quite a long letter to William which I hope he received. I have seen Carlyle as I told him and liked him very much. I am sure you would like him & that he would like you. But I must close, dear Walt, hoping to be in W.Washington ahead of the snow birds.Your friendJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 30 October 1871"
