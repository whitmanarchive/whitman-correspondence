    "text": "Anderton, nr Chorley.Lancashire, England6. February. 1891.My dear Walt Whitman,I was extremely pleased, last evening, to receive the copy of Ingersoll's lecture you were kind enough to send me, & I thank you for it with all my heart.I have read it over tonight for the first time.—I was hardly prepossessed in its favour. I had previously known but little of Ingersoll. And I learned from Carlyle, long ago, to care little forplatform \"oratory\" as such, & to consider the main question always (as you do) \"What does it amount to?\" And the newspaper reports (necessarily brief & imperfect) did not make it appear to amount to very much.But the full report, as I read it, swept away all prepossession & criticism, & filled me with a great & dilating joy. It is a great & notable utterance—strong, manly brave & free—worthy of its subject, & worthy of a great American orator to an American audience.I feel as though I should like to write to Ingersoll himself to thank him for it. And rejoice, with all my heart, that at last you should have heard so strong a public declaration of the value of your work. Honour to Ingersoll for it! and gratitude & love to him from all your friends here.But my rejoicing is greatly disturbed & overclouded by intelligence received at noon today of your relapse & ill health. Dr. J. sent me a copy of a paragraph in yesterdays \"Daily Graphic\" as follows:—\"A post card received from Walt Whitman says:—'Am having an extra bad spell these days. May blow over; may not.'\"No date is given so that I do not know when it was written. But we shall be very anxious indeed till we hear further. I will write to Traubel by this mail to ask him to send word at once.Dearest & best of friends! Most honoured of benefactors! What can we say to you?—but that our warmest love & sympathy & our hearts' best wishes are with you always.—With best loveYours affectionatelyJ.W. Wallace James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 6 February 1891"
