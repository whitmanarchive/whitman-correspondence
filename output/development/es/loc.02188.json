    "text": "12 Well RoadHampstead.July 21st, 1885.Dear old Walt A wish has suddenly and quite spontaneously sprung up in England amongst your readers to in some part pay off the debt owed every poet & especially to you. I hope that you may see your way to letting this little bud blossom. I shall proceed no further in this until I hear from you: trusting that you will not deprive England of this honour. I could not well write to you before as the scheme was so sudden and spontaneous. I think that you will like Wedmore, he is coming to call upon you in September. Wedmore is about the best critical writer in London and quite the best of his kind. Although precise and neat his mind moves with freedom as a candid mind should. Our friend is somewhat of a butterfly though I have always found a staunch friend in Wedmore, in short I like him. I fear me that you do not take such pleasure in Glendale as you did in Kirkwood I do not hear of your being there much. I am sorry Ruthie has married so young, it means a long hard life probably in the country. Her mother too has no one to help her. My mother's health is but sadly, but it is wonderful what she manages to do, continuing always to think and work for others, herself last. My sister's voice is developing and her art is beginning to be admired. I am in excellent health and spirits. My picture in this year's Royal Academy was a good deal noticed, and has done my reputation good: in fact I am getting on my feet, slowly. I am rather hankering after a studio right down in the city amongst men: From a business point of view it is fatal not be central, and besides I love the Strand, Oh! how you would too, sort of human Delaware river. With best loveHerbert H Gilchrist.THE ANTHENÃ†UM No 3011, July 11, '85 A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by occasional contributions to magazines. Mr. Herbert H. Gilchrist, 12, Well Road, Hampstead, acts as honorary and corresponding secretary to this scheme; Mr. Rossetti, 5, Endsleigh Gardens, Euston Square, as treasurer. Herbert Gilchrist to Walt Whitman, 21 July 1885"
