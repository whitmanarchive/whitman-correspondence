March 2Dear John, & 'Sula,This will show you that \"the lamp still holds out to burn\"—though I have had a bad two months past—I have had another paralytic stroke, but it passed over, without any thing serious, (it is probable I have had several slight strokes)—but I am feeling, as I write, about the same as is now usual for me—still entertain expectations—If practicable I shall bring out a Vol. the coming summer—I hope to pay you the visit yet—Did you get the paper I sent with a report of Emerson's late lecture on Eloquence—of course interesting, from him, but nothing very stunning, it seemed to me—I see that Conway is coming to America next autumn certain, to see things, travel, lecture, &c——John, [I] send you the last letter from a quondam correspondent & unseen rebel friend of mine, away down in Alabama—He seems to me a good affectionate fellow, a sort of uncut gem—I have had five or six letters from him, all primitive but good—What are you about?—& how are you & 'Sula getting along? Walt WhitmanMy brother & sister well—brother full of business— Walt Whitman to John and Ursula Burroughs, 2 March [1875]"
