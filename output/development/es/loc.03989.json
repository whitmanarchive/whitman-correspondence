Things are about as they were when you was down here, (any more than we have had a fearful storme[storm] of wind and sand). The wind blew so hard last Sunday night, that it almost upset me when I was comeing[coming] home, \"for I was out then, as usual.\" Father and all are well: \"John\" the 'darkey man' is here yet: and George have their fun has been the has been about drinking it to his skin white; it rather gets to him, but he takes it all in good part: he asked Van other day, wheather[whether] the first man on earth was black or white, and Van told him the first man was white, and then John asked him where the black man came from, and Van told hime[him] that a black man was a monkey with his tail cut off, so he gave up talking to him and whent[went] on with Georg[George].There is quite in the music since the wind is \"Age of wish you , I have been going for it for sometime but haven't thought of it before.I have been thinking of the suit of clothsclothes which I am to have like yours: I have had myself all pictured out with a suit of gray, and a white slouch hat on about fifty times, since you spoke of it; the fellows will call me Walt then. I will have to do something great and good in honor of the name. What will it be? have to close, out at Friday Yours trulyHarry StaffordPS. write soon and let know how you are Yours H.S.
