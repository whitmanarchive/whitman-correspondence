I have here to day, & am reading with interest. Herby is well & brown—Shall be up in good time to be with with my dear neices[nieces] & all of you—I wonder if you have the same splendor of days & nights as we here the week past.I suppose you will have Edward Carpenter's letter to Herby by this time & will find it indeed cheery & interesting.Love to allW. W. Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, [4 September 1877]"
