    "text": "BurlingtonTuesday morningMarch 4 My dear BrotherHow are you this morning.—I wish I was where I could come in and see you and do something for you—that has been a trouble to us. that we cantcan't be of the least benefit to you now when you are ill. You dontdon't know anything about how bad and sorry I felt about your illnessYou have been exceedingly kind and thoughtful dear brother to write to me, that first letter was very welcome I was wonderfully glad to get it, a little afraid you was not hardly yet strong enough to write.—Dear Mother too has been kind about writing I expect a line every day I am anxious to hear.I have not heard for eleven days—I do so hope to hear the good news that you are better, and are able to go out a littleI feel glad when itsit's bright pleasant weather I think maybe you will gain faster,—I know my dear brother you have a good deal of patience and that you do not easily get discouraged and that too is in your favour,—You have a good many friends I know, and have every attention, every little thing done for your comfort that can be done, do you not Walt,—Still it would seem better, to us, if some of us was near you.Has George been to see you I suppose he has thoughAnd dear brother Jeffy too I know as soon as he can think of anything he will go to see you. I should like to hear from him and the dear little girlsDo you remember Walt some years ago, what a bad time I had with my back (I think it was neuralgie of the spine) anyway I was well only my back I could not walk three steps for many weeks & could sit up all day, & when I could walk about & even go up & down stairs I was a good deal more than half bent over, & I was bent over so nearly as bad for more than a year,—I only speak of it so you will know how much time will do, my back is now as strong as it ever was in the worldI do so want you to get well Walt, I shall be so happy when you are strong as ever again, and persons tell me you will be, a good many inquire about you.—You know your room here is always ready. I do hope when it warm weather, in June you will come, I remember you liked the mountain air here and I know it will be good for you And I have been thinking if dear Mother too could bear the journey. for it would seem just like home to you then, and I do not think it safe to stay in Washington like you did last summer, & Charlie has a great wish to go away to the Adirondacks & other places, & itsit's a great bother to leave the house alone with me, & I would do every thing in my power for you, dear brotherI dontdon't know why I have not written to you before, I wish I had somethinsomething cheerful to tell you, things are just the same here I only want you to be well again I do like that young fellow that is so kind to you, Peter Doyle, I shall always remember himGood bye my dear brother, I send you a great deal of love, Charlie also sends loveHan Hannah Whitman Heyde to Walt Whitman, 4 March [1873]"
