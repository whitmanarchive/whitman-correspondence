    "text": "O death I cover you over with roses and early liliesBut mostly and more the lilac that blooms the firstCopius I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes.with loaded arms I come, pouring for youFor you and this Coffins all of you O death.Sea–winds blown from East and WestBlown from the Eastern Sea and blown from, the Western Sea, till there on the prairies meeting.These and with these I'll perfume the grave of him I loveO what shall I hang on the chamber wall?:And what shall the pictures be I hang on the walls,To adorn the burial house of him I love,O light and free and tender!O wild and loose to my soul—O wonderous singer. You only I hear, yet this star holds me, (but will soon depart)Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.Sing on dearest brotherwarble your reedy song.Loud human song, with voice of utter–most woe,Limitless out of the dusk out of the ceders[cedars] and pines. This moment yearning and thoughtful I turn back and think of that old man whom I met but once only for a few minutes, His books read and absorbed in part, his life, a part of it read of asking about of men loungers about the ferry houses, looking for a glimpse of his face at the little former house yet never seeing him, wondering eager over the news since first I saw or heard it, now learning to love the man The book and the author. I have two photographs, one in book, the other lately taken, within ten years. I look at the engraving in Leaves of Grass, at the gray in the beard at the features all absorbing and always wondering \"if only he could know\" everything is all light , transparent as light, yet all dark and moody and tearful,I would prize above all earthly things to see you and loaf awhile and ask you so much and so many things.I think what I wonder now if you still are the same lover of God and man unconventionally as is portrayed in Leaves of Grass. I read not long ago in the Century a line \"the vagaries of my life\" This troubled me. is the book and its plan and purpose a vagary. All the teaching of the native inherent immortality of the soul, is this a vagary. The Hebrew Scriptures declare so, the New Testament writings declare so. \"If you love me, keep my commandments.\" If you care for me read my book. I am sorry that the People do not understand, but as yet, the people of the States have not arisen, wait for the fusion of men nationalities and the type shall come forth. I hear much talk of the Lord's coming, but all things center on on this our globe. I cannot understand much of these things, only of my love and affection this I am sure of. May I call my self a pupil—Dear old man you are beloved more than you can know this is the best I have and you have it. I see you there and my hearts love goes out to you to night across seas and continents, now three score years and ten and soon to be yours, if only America would listen and the young men and young women could see that ideal life: To time, this is your book's dedication So long with love Nagasaki, Japan September 20, 90, To Walt WhitmanCamden, New JerseyU.S.A.
