Boughs will be done—will make from 120 to 130 (or possibly 135) pages—(those solid long primer pages eat up the copy at a terribly rate!)—I have not worried at it—& do not—indeed it has probably been more benefit to me than hurt—I have been unspeakably helped by Horace Traubel—& by the best printers I have ever yet had—The Century people have just sent me again my Army Hospitals & Cases proof—I judge it is intended for the October number—bowel movements continue every day or other day—I take no drugs at all—have not moved from my room yet—keep good spirits—young Dr. Mitchell has just come—weather pleasant continued—warmish but I am satisfied—Tom Harned comes every day, often bringing his nice always welcome children—2 pm—y'rs of 22d has come—I have enjoy'd a partial washWalt WhitmanI send you proof pp 97 to 104 inclusive—as I understand you have all preceding— Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 24 July 1888"
