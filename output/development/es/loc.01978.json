I have the cool assumption of immorality for mainly from false to the great trusts in them, while these humbler ones as the dog, and horse, faithful unto death, unselfish and must be cut short in a honest and trues, , and uncomplaining.But this little note was not intended to afflict you with a discussion of the mighty of the which holds us all, big and little its mighty leash, I want to ask you, respected sir, to point me to the volume wherein I can find the excerpt and its is what I desire and if you will kindly help me I shall remain as nowYours gratefullyMarie WallaceGramercy Park HouseNew York Marie Wallace to Walt Whitman, [undated]"
