    "text": "Camdennoon Sept.27 '89 Bright sunny day—quite cool—Ed has just built a fire—I am sitting here as usual in the big chair—suppose you get the Harper's Weekly I sent yesterday with my little poemet \"Bravo Paris Exposition!\" —Nothing very new or notable—bowel action—no medicines, no doctor- visits for a long time—Mrs: O'C[onnor] must be still in Boston, (she went temporarily thence to Nantucket but I guess has return'd)—I guess R P Smith has return'd to 44 Grosvenor Road, London—(I have sent of late by mail to him at Haselmere)—y'rs rec'd—welcomed—have not been out in wheel chair many days—shall probably get out this after- noon— Sept. 28 noon—Sunny & cool continued. Am feeling fairly—John Burroughs is here this forenoon—has been at Ashbury Park (a nice place on the Jersey sea shore) the last week, with his wife & boy—all well—the last two have gone back to Po'keepsie—& John jaunts on here, & to New York to-night, & back to West Park. J is well, & looks well, works in his vineyard & farm, & feels well—Dr Brinton here last evn'g (with Horace)—talked interestingly of Arabia where he has lived lately—of the common people & their ways, looks, & life—the bulk of Arabs— I have grapes quite copiously of late, & eat them—Shall send this off Saturday night— Walt Whitmanletters to-day (28th) f'm Mrs. O'C and Kennedy—all well— Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 27–28 September 1889"
