    "text": "see notes July 29 1888 | also July 30(address)Rugby, England,Jan. 9th, 1883Sir:I have received the copy of \"Specimen Days & Collect\" which you were so kind as to send me, and I hope to have the opportunity soon of saying what I think about it in some English periodical. I have been deeply interested in the book, especially in so far as it supplies the 'embryons' of \"Leaves of Grass\", and I am especially gratified to receive it from yourself.My acquaintance with 'Leaves of Grass' dates from my early university days some ten years ago, when having come across Rossetti's edition of selections I was induced soon after to get a complete edition. Since then I have never neglected them, and often enjoyed the effect of awakening others to perception of its great force and beauty, which being accompanied by so much which (justly or unjustly) excites prejudice, are too often overlooked. As regards the new book, which I have eagerly read, some of it was familiar to me already, e.g. Democratic Vistas—but 'Specimen Days' was entirely new and altogether delightful. I am inclined to think that it will place many readers in a better position to appreciate 'Leaves of Grass', than heretofore.With thanks both for this book and for former benefits received—I remain—Yours faithfully,G. C. Macaulay. G. C. Macaulay to Walt Whitman, 9 January 1883"
