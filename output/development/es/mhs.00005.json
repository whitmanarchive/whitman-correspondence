    "text": "WashingtonSaturday mn'g April 9 '64 Dear brotherI got a letter from Mother this morning, & she sends one to you for me to direct—I will just enclose both—you must write to Mother oftener—before she got this last letter it was too long, & seemed ten times longer than it was—if she don't hear from you in a long while she just gets sick about it—she is getting pretty old, & shows it at last—still I think she is pretty well—Nothing new with me—I wrote you three days ago, to Annapolis, I suppose you got it—Jeff is away a good deal of the time, surveying &c—We are having another rain-storm set in here this morning—Congress is splurging away, doing some good things too—I see Kalbfleisch & Odell here frequently—have you writ to Han? Well, brother, good bye for present—Walt Walt Whitman to George Washington Whitman, 9 April 1864"
