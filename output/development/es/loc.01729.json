    "text": "New YorkJune 17th, 68My dear Walt,Your letter of inquiry and of the good old feeling has this moment reached me. I hasten to reply, and with hearty thanks for your generous favor, report for the second time that the Books, letter, and paper reached me promptly.I replied immediately thanking you as I do now for your kindness. Be assured of the high estimate I place upon your gift, and the glowing thoughts to which you have given utterance.\"Leaves Of Grass\" forever! Your heart can never cease to beat.Immortal friend and benefactor, God bless you. My heart warms towards Mr. Burroughs for his friendly words. I know I should love to meet him.Don't fail my dear friend to call on me when you come to New York. Mrs. Hine thanks you for your remembrance, also the little girl Lucy. I have now two sons, one four, and the youngest not quite a year old. Mrs. H has grown stout like yourself, and now weighs two hundred pounds. She and the children are in the country. \"When Lilacs Last In The Door Yard Bloomed\" pleases me so much that I read it over every day or two with increased interest. My dear old friend I love youâ€”I shall be proud to hear from you at our Annies[Annie's] and quick to reply.Charles HineP.S.My picture, of which I sent you a notice will rest in somnolence during the summer.Charles Charles Hine to Walt Whitman, 17 June 1868"
