    "text": "BelmontSept 15 '89 (Sunday afternoon)Dear Walt:—I never meant my last poor postal to be the answer to yr kind page-letter. And now that I am taking a vacation of six weeks to write the bk I told you of, I must bore you with a letter—just to say how'd'e, + to tell you that my staunch little dame, my brave frau- is going to make a little visiting tour, + will some day make you a little call (second reading: a profusion of \"littles\" in here by mistake!) (in abt' two2 weeks) if agreeable. She is of the cheery-shy kind, + will do you good. But if it shd so happen that you shd not feel like seeing anybody on the day she comes, she wants me to say that she will not feel in the least grudgy—any more than I shall, ever, if I shall happen to knock at yr door on the wrong day.I feel like myself again, now I am out for a vacation—like a man escaped fr. the penitentiary. I inquired at the stores for Liberty, but it is not to be had at any of the news stands in Boston.no satire intended! (second reading of this I will stop in to see \"Ben\" himself next time I go in.—Traubel has not written me for some time. I miss his letters.Hooray! for my freedom! [Here I cut a caper] Now for six weeks of thought.I wrote to F. Wilson yesterday, asking him to either report on MS. or return to me.I feel that I have broadened + deepened my knowledge of human nature amazingly by the past two years of shoulder to shoulder work with the (to me) hitherto unfamiliar class of skilled city mechanics (+ proof-readers). I feel much stronger in digestion + in sinew, + in character; self-reliant: nothing like it: to be able to snap yr fingers at cant, compromise, the sneaks of the profession, + c.Our kitten is lovely: I have propagated, from the slips, ten new choice roses, + they are now 5 inches high. My gloire di Dijon rose has grown 12 feet high in many rigorous shoots.Have you got hold of those D'Artagnan romances of Dumas? I think you wd find them a good anodyne—almost as good as Scott. Manly adventure is the theme—and love. But especially embodied comradeship: it is yr calamus doctrine embodied in a faint + inferior degree (the Gallic nature is not so deep in the affectional nature as the German you know)good by dear friend, + much love fr yrs alwaysW. S. Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 15 September 1889"
