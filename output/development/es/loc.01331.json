And if so, could you spare me one or two for the Magazine which I represent? I am sorry that but a trifle could be offered for them, as the Magazine has been neglected of late, and has only recently come into my hands, to be worked up again by labour & patienceI trust you are as well as you expect to be, and nearly as happy as you hope.Yours faithfullyKenningale Cook.to Walt Whitman Esq. Kenningale Cook to Walt Whitman, 23 April 1877"
