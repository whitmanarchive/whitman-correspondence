Jersey.April 10, 12 MDear Pete,74Nothing very new or different in my condition, or any thing else—have hardly been doing as well since I last wrote, as before—but still hope to pull up.—Rec'd your letter last Monday, & the Herald. Not much of a letter this time, my loving boy—as I dontdon't seem to be able to write much—though, as I sit here, I am not feeling any worse than usual. Ashton has lost his little child; died last Thursday. I have just rec'd two letters from Mrs. O'Connor. How does all go with you? Pete, darling, shan't I send you a little money? Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 10 April [1874]"
