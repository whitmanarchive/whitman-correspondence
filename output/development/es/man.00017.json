    "text": "Tuesday, July 29GlasshouseShinroneKings CountyIrelandDear Mr WhitmanLast year, in June '78. I was the means of introducing your book to a Mrs Alexander, in the North of Ireland. She wrote at that time to you, enclosing a money order for £1-6-0 for one of your books, I think the Two Rivulets. A couple of months afterwards I heard that she had never received any answer, & after some time I wrote to my friend Professor Dowden whom I knew to be in correspondence with you, asking him to mention the circumstance to you when he next wrote. I think he must have forgotten to do this, as I have heard again today that Mrs Alexander has not received the book. Therefore I thought better to write to you myself, as having given her your address, &c. I feel myself in a certain degree responsible. I heard that at the time you should have received her letter you were away from home. I concluded that the letter failed somehow to reach you. And it has also occurred to me that perhaps your last edition is out & you have no more copies to send—or that you may have mislaid the letter & address.So I should be much obliged if you would let me have a line today whether you ever received it, or not, & if your books are obtainable from you still in the usual way.You have forgotten no doubt a letter I wrote you some years ago while an undergraduate in College, thanking you as deeply as I could find words to do for the spiritual health and thought I had found or gained in the Leaves of Grass. I cannot let this occasion pass without renewing my thanks, sending you again my greeting and love. Your book has travelled with me wherever I have gone. I have joined hands with you in it, tried to realize its ideals in my life; and to lead others to do so, often I am glad to say with success. homage like this you must have often received, nevertheless I think you will hardly think very lightly of any one—and this makes me feel encouraged to tell you freely what you have done for me.Yours affty.affectionatelyT. W. H. Rolleston.P.S. If you will kindly send Mrs Alexander the Two Rivulets, & let me know, I will enclose you the money if not received. Her address is Mrs J. AlexanderThe PalaceDerryIreland.TWHR. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, July 29, 1879"
