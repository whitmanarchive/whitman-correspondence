    "text": "good letter—from W S Kennedy85(over)BelmontMassJan 16 84Dear W.W.I send you by this mail my paper—\"The New Ars Poetica\"I want you to read it, &, if you think best, ask McKay to bring it out for us.I have a strong & even strange feeling of the educative and epoch-making nature of your style (poetical); & I am confident that my essay will do great good. I want all the chief American & especially the English poets to have copies. Nothing in the world, I believe, stands so much in the way of the greater sale of yryour \"Leaves\" as the idea among people that your style is ridiculous & unpoetical. The laugh, I find, is always raised by this the first thing. If they cdcould have good authority or rendered reason & proof that the style was true to nature & good in itself, other difficulties wdwould easily melt away.I have examined all literary sources, but have had to work out the subject—in the main, by slow & painful original steps. What do you think of my performance? I wish the libret might even be bound. It ought to sell a small edition. Can you interest some moneyed fellow in it? as ever yrsyoursW. S. Kennedy.Last p.Can't you write me something yourself on the all important subject? Come: that wdwould sell the brochure sure. Write it to me, say, in the form of a letter which I then print by yryour permission. Do you see?Do exert yourself in the matter if you feel able. I believe it wdwould give you a money return. We shd get people to talking at a great rate. Especially if you are quoted as saying something philosophical on the subject; something new, in addition to that in preface & yryour first quarto.K. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 16 January 1885"
