I cannot send the amounts since it was understood that the individual sums should not be made known and some of the largest givers expressly made that stipulation, on the ground that it might be unjust to those who could give but little and yet in proportion gave even more largely than themselves. You will see that some are from outside Boston. Mrs. Van Renssalaer is, I believe, the only representative of New York, but if there had been anybody there to take hold we could have got many, I am confident. Mrs. Van R. is a genuine friend and hearing of the project specially send[sent] me word she wished to subscribe. She was visiting here then.Saw Kennedy yesterday: has been working hard reading proof. Saw Dr. Bartol the other day and he spoke warmly of you.What glorious October weather!Faithfully yours,Sylvester Baxter.Subscribers to Whitman Cottage Fund.J. T. TrowbridgeC. A. BartolWilliam P.
