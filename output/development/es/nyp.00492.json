I continue quite well for me. The British publisher of the \"W W\" is Wilson & McCormick, St Vincent Street, Glasgow—they also issue (under their own imprint) L of G and Specimen Days—the new book somewhat sluggish yet—it will take to fall & winter before the news gets well around—but it is secured & effectual—W W Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 27 June 1883"
