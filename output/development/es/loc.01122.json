    "text": "Middletown N.Y.June 2d 73Dear Walt,I got the Camden paper this morning containing the notice of your mothers death. I had heard through Eldridge a few days ago that all was over with her. I suppose it was not unexpected to you yet for all that the blow must have been a heavy one to all her children and doubly so to yourself. I should like to hear from you the particulars of her last days. I wish I might have seen her again. If you are able to write do drop me a line & tell me about yourself & what your plans are for the summer. I hope you do not think of returning to W. before fall. I go to N. Y. to-morrow for a few days. While there a letter addressed to me care of George Bliss Jr. W. S. Atty, 41 Chambers St. will reach me. If you can come North & spend some time with me I should be delighted. I am going out on L. I. to look at a place for sale, Yaphank on Carmand Ruin. Do you know the country out there?My nephew, Chancy B. is with me for a few days but leaves to-morrow; so does Sulic for Kingston. They both speak affectionately of you & are much concerned on your account.The lilacs are in their prime here, but the season is getting dry.With much love.Ever YoursJohn Burroughs John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 2 June 1873"
