    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden New JerseyU S AmericaDec: 18 '81My dear Rudolf SchmidtYours of Nov: 27 rec'dreceived. Console yourself for suffering f'mfrom rheumatism—for it might be paralysis—I still keep around—am much more comfortable than four years ago, but am very lame & clumsy, (yet red and stout)—Bjornson did not come to see me—America you know is a big country, & he had many places to go to—I think Clemens Petersen is still some where in this country—very likely doing well—the last time I saw him he came up to me (personally looked well) in New York, between two & three years ago, in a crowd, & only a few words—he is a quite well known literary person & if he had died or any thing happened, I should have heard of it—I too mourn the death of Elster—though unknown I had formed a liking for him—I shall forward one of my books to Thorsteinsson—Dr Bucke's book will not be published for some months—perhaps a year—I send you, same mail with this, a copy of my new edition—As I write it is Sunday, just before sunset—& we have had a fine day—indeed a fine mild winter so far—have been in my room all day, writing &c, very comfortable—shall now walk to the post office, & probably sail once or twice across the river, the Delaware here, a mile wide—The London publisher & agent for my new edition is David Bogue, St Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square—I have heard that my book is to be translated into German, by some friends in Dresden—also into Russian by some Russian exiles & a Mr Lee a Russ-English scholar—I have been written to about both propositions & of course have expressed warmest assent—So good bye, my dear friend—& affectionate wishes to you & yours—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 18 December 1881"
