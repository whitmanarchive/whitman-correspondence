I have done nothing & said nothing about the lecture since I wrote you, as hearing from you was the first thing in order. I think we can work the thing up by April. I shall go to N.Y.New York the last of this week & talk the matter up with Gilder & Stedman & others. I know all depends upon how the matter is is put through & we have time enough to go to work in order.I presume I shall go to NY.New York on Thursday: if you want to write to me there, write care of Scribner & Co 743 Broadway.The 14th of April comes on Sunday, Monday night would be our time. All well. Much love to the Gilchrists.As EverJohn Burroughs.John Burroughs | Feb 26 '78 | (abt the lecture) John Burroughs to Walt Whitman, 25 February 1878"
