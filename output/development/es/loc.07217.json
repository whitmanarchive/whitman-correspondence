    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,27 July 1888I was heartily glad to get this morning your note of 25th with its' three encolsures, the notes from Miss Bates, Rhys, and Sadakitchi. I have proofs continuously to p.104 and shall hope to soon get the E.H & Fox pieces. I wish the Hospital piece which the Century has could go in the book too but we should have to wait too long for that I fear? I do wish I could hear that you were gaining strength, you are certainly better mentally and from what I hear you eat better and are better in yourself. There must have been some little extension of the paralisisparalysis to make you helpless in the legs—I still hope however. You have undoubtedly gained some and I do not see why you should not gain more—we must have patience and not give up.Willy Gurd is to be home in a month with his meter done. I may have to go East on that business after he comes and stays here for a rest so I look forward to seeing you again before very long. By that time Osler will be back and we can have some talk—but I do not look for medicine to do much for you except at a pinch—it might tide you overYour loving friendRM BuckeSee notes July 29, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 27 July 1888"
