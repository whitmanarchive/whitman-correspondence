    "text": "New Castle PaJuly 22.My Dear Walt—I got your pleasant letter, and thank you for the attention you paid my note through Mr. Cummins I feared our aggressiveness (perhaps my mulishness) on the 20 percent and other mooted questions had obliterated on your side, our friendship. I am happy in begging your pardon. & I have not seen Townsend since his return over the water, but I had a talk with his beautiful and intelligent wife in PhilaPhiladelphia & she said that not only did Townsend admire you and yours but that he had also weaned her from a prejudice. I do not believe that man exists whom Townsend is more anxious to know intimately than lusty Walt Whitman. You will both be gratified one of these days, for it is your and his Destiny. I wonder if I will lose two \"bully\" friends, when you two come together?Cummins is a whole sound, but erratic, fellow, and a good companion. He regards his friendships warmly. I'm glad you met him.I should like to see Burrough's> book on you, & will pay the price & postage if he will send it to me. However I expect to be in Washington in a couple of weeks & I can secure the essay then. The health of self & family is better than for sometime past—thanks to the pure air of the mountains. I think I never appreciated the country before—its flowers, its trees its rocks & its brooks, to say nothing of the greenness of the grass or the perfumed air. I have looked for the name in the corner of the Lord's pockethandkerchief many times here & I dare not say I have not found it.Write me again before I see you.The Ramsdell family here send[sends] nothing short of love to Walt Whitman.GoodbyeH. J. RamsdellI do not know George Townsend's present address, but care of Tribune will reach himHiram Hiram J. Ramsdell to Walt Whitman, 22 July 1867"
