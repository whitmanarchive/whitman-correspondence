    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,18 Nov 1890Many thanks, dear Walt, for the two bundles of papers received yesterday and to-day—the one containing \"Liberty\" \"N.Y. World\" and cuttings and the other the \"Critic\" of 21 Dec. 89. All welcome but especially the \"World\" with its curious \"obituary\" of Walt Whitman \"the American Dante, Aeschylus or Shakespeare\" printed in '71 and which I had never seen before or even heard of. It is a most valuable item for my collection and will be valued beyond most old newspapers. How is the abdominal pain? wearing away I hope? or have you seen any doctor about it?We are all well here—beautiful weather most of the time—has been a charming day and is now a lovely moonlight nightWith loveRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 18 November 1890"
