    "text": "328 Mickle streetCamden New JerseyOctober 5 1884I knew Reuben Farwell as a first-class soldier (it was in 1863 or '64) of a Michigan Regiment—he was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, Dr Bliss Superintendent—I was with him off & on some months & remember the case perfectly well. He had a very bad foot wound, & I should judge it something that would deteriorate his health & more or less incapacitate him through life afterward—till his death—& even toward that event—which as I understand occurred about a year ago. I strongly recommend the granting a pension to his widow Ann E. Farwell.Very respectfully,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to the Commissioner of Pensions, 5 October 1884"
