    "text": "54 Manchester RoadBoltonLancashire, EnglandNovr 15th 1890.Dear Walt WhitmanAccept of my best thanks for your kind letter with the enclosed slips of your article on \"Old Poets,\" which I received on the 13th inst. the article is one of great interest to me intrinsically; and extrinsically because of the rigorous mentality it evidences.By the same mail I received a letter form John Burroughs in which he says that he \"spent two or three days in Camden, the latter part of Septr\" and found you \"in pretty good condition\" the best for three years he thinks—which is good news for all your friends here. He also says that he has sent your photo (from my negative) \"back to England, to a daughter of Charles Kingsley's, who wanted one & who is a reader and admirer of Whitman.\"By the way I have not heard whether the negative reached you safely or not. If so I hope it may be of use to you.I will send J. B. another photo of you. He considers it a most excellent one. He has an article with North American Review for Oct. on \"faith and credulity\" but I have not read it yet.Ingersoll had an article in the Sept number on \"Tolstoi and the Kreutzer Sonata\".I received a letter form Captain Nowell (from Guccustown) respecting our commission & his visit to you.I conveyed your loving salutation & benediction to J W Wallace and in a letter to me in which he tells me of certain worries & troubles he says that it is \"like a message of comfort from the skies\" to him, & he continues—\"God bless him! Say I & my grateful love accompany him always!\"—I saw him this morning. He is looking pretty well and sends his love to you, as do all the friends whom I have met since receiving yr letter. At our last meeting (at the house of Wentworth Dixon) I read \"The Carpenter\"—at least the most of it—which took me nearly two hours, and much did they all enjoy that splendid story and the charming glimpses it gives of your personality & influence—some of them being \"fetched\" by parts of it; and no wonder, for it is a most moving story and powerfully told. At next meeting (Novr 17th) I shall read your letter & your article to them.We have had some typical English November weather here lately—a good deal of rain and fog—but this has been a truly delightful day of gladsome, benignant sunshine—a welcome \"halcyon days\" before the winter settles upon us. I have just returned from the Bolton Chrysanthemum Show in our Town Hall where I have spent a very pleasant hour promenading, listening to the strains of our grand organ & looking at the really fine display of gorgeously tinted bloom—quite a pleasant break in my professional work.I hope you are keeping better & have quite got rid of the cough I have no cough—& I have had none Warry told me of in his letter.With best love to you & kindest regards to all your householdremainYours affectionatelyJ. JohnstonPS I enclose a newspaper cutting of the latest recorded instance of local bravery.I had a post card from Dr Bucke asking me to get him a copy of the Sunday Chronical which contains the article upon you but I am sorry to say that it cannot now be obtained at the office. We have seen Dr. Bucke's letter in \"The Conservator.\"J J John Johnston to Walt Whitman, 15 November 1890"
