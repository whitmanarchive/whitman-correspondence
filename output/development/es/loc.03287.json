    "text": "see notes July 29 1888 | also Aug 1NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW.(EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT.)(DICTATED TO STENOGRAPHER.)NEW YORK,August 11, 1885.Dear Walt Whitman: I wrote you several days ago asking you to tell me whether $100 was your lowest price. I think I said also that if you charged lower than that price I could sell a great many more articles for you than I could at these rates. I enclose a check for $60, which is payment for the article according to your own estimate of 3,000 words, at the rate of $20 a thousand, which is the very highest rate they pay. I had to decide within ten minutes whether I would accept it or not, as Mr. Ferris, who is in charce[charge] of the syndicate, was just about to start for Mount McGregor. I told him, however, that if you refused to sell the article for less I should consider myself responsible for the balance and expect payment for it either from him or from Mr. Rice. So my dear old friend I have protected your interests to the best of my judgement and if you want me to follow orders and break owners in future let me know and I will do it. The great problem that the universe is asking you this moment is whether I am to regard this check as payment in full or payment on account. I also would like you to answer my letters. I have no interest whatever in the syndicate to which I sold the manuscript. Ever yours trulyJas Redpath James Redpath to Walt Whitman, 11 August 1885"
