    "text": "April 21st, Monday, 1 o'clock afternoon.Mother, I am decidedly improving—feel more like myself the last three days—I walk very clumsily yet, & do not try to get around by walking—but I think I am stronger now, & my prospects are better than any time yet. The doctor has applied electricity again to-day, making the third application—So upon the whole I think I am doing real well—I have rec'd a letter from Priscilla Townsend—She speaks of you, says that Aunt Sally always wants to hear from you—She speaks of Sarah Avery's calling there, & of Mrs. Tripp, & all—nothing very new—I am writing this over at the office—It is pleasant here, but cloudy & coolish—Mother, I suppose you got my letter Saturday last—How is Sister Lou getting along—when you write tell me about her—George I suppose is full of business—Well I believe it is better for a man to have plenty to do, if he is well & active—Well, mamma dear, I have written you quite a rambling letter—Tell me when you want envelopes & I will send them—write whenever you can—I think I shall be able to soon give a good account of my improvement. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 21 April [1873]"
