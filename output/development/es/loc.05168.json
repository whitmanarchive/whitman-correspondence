    "text": "10 Dec. 82Dear WaltI have been through \"Specimen Days and Collect\" pretty thoroughly, it is well printed and I find remarkably few corrections of any kind required—I enclose a list of what I have found. This makes about six times that I have read \"Democratic Vistas\" it is a wonderfullwonderful piece of writing, as fine in some respects as any thing in L. of G. but of course has not the life, fire, inspiration (or whatever you may call it) of such poems as \"Song of Myself\" \"A Song of the Open Road\" and a good many others, however I now take back entirely what I once said to you about \"Democratic Vistas\" to the effect that some other man might have written it. At the present moment I do not believe any other man who ever lived might or could have written it any more than any other man could have written \"Calamus\"—I go to Toronto tomorrow on some government business, shall be gone a few days, I want to hear from you, how you keep, when you are coming here &c &cI am with much loveAffectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 10 December 1882"
