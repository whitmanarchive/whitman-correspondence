    "text": "Insane AsylumLondon OntarioLondon,23 Nov. 1890Your card of 20th came to hand yesterday afternoon—I am glad to hear good accounts of the \"belly-ache\" that it is passing off, may it stick to it and pass off altogether! Two days ago the \"Address\" promised me by Wallace came to hand—this morning I read it slowly and carefully, it is a wonderful revelation, which he gives there and I have been more moved by that ½ hour's reading than I have been by any thing for a long time. I want you to send me Wallace's letter back (please don't forget) and if you wd like to read the \"Address\" I will have a copy made of it for you. I have been reading again and again \"The Sun-Set Breeze\" and am amazed more and more at its depth and subtlety.As always, dear Walt, with loveRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 23 November 1890"
