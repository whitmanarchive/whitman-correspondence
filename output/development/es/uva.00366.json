    "text": "Sunday forenoon May 11Dearest mother,Well, mother dear, I am certainly getting well again—I have made a great improvement the last three days, & my head feels clear & good nearly all the time—& that, the doctor says, will bring my leg all right in a little while—Yesterday was a beautiful day, & I was out a good deal—walked some, a couple of blocks, for the first time—Peter Doyle convoyed me—This morning I have had my breakfast, and have been sitting by my open window looking out—it is very pleasant & warm, but cloudy—we have heavy showers here nights—too much rain indeed—still spring is very fine here, & it looks beautiful from my windows—I am writing this in my room—I am feeling just now well as usual in my general health—part of the time, just as well as ever—but of course I expect a few set–backs before I get well entirely, & supple in my limbs—It is remarkable how much paralysis there is—cases occur here, every few days—& in other cities—There is quite a time here about the burial of Mr. Chase, his body is at the Capitol to–day, & he is buried to–morrow—mother, the paper I send you has a picture of a railroad depot they are building here—it is for the road Peter Doyle works on—You will see a piece in that paper about the Beecher and Tilton scandal—it is very coarse—I think Beecher a great humbug, but I don't believe there is any truth in that piece—(but of course don't know)—I am still having electricity applied—the doctor applied it yesterday—I am certainly getting along better the last few days—feel better—feel more like myself—I shall come & pay you a visit the first part of next month—shall write before I come, the time, &c—Mother, I hope this will find you feeling better—I shall be anxious to hear—write a line or two, Tuesday—As I sit by the window this forenoon looking out, I wish you could take a look at the prospect, it is so fine, the trees & grass so green, and the river & hills in the distance—it does one good to look at it—Mother, I shall feel anxious until I hear from you—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 11 May [1873]"
