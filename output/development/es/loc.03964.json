I know how I have served you on many occasions before. I know that it is my falt[fault] and not yours. Can you forgive me and take me back and love me the same I will try by the grace of God to do better. I cannot give you up, and it makes me feel so bad to think how we have spent the last day or two; and all for my temper. I will have to controolcontrol it or it will send me to the states prison or some other bad place. CantCan't you take me back and love me the same.Your lovinloving but bad temperedHarry.
