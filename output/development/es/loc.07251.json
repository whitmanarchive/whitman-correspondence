    "text": "Superintendent's Office ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,1 Oct. 1888Horace Traubel has sent me (just to hand) \"Herald\" of 23d ult. have been reading the piece on you and like it well. Who is the author? I hope that pain has left you by this time? I have written Osler to ask him about you, how you are, and about that pain, what it means? though I feel pretty sure it does not mean anything serious, some indigestion or a cold—perhaps it is in the abdominal wall and not internal at all—such pains are very common—Myalgia, we call them, or muscular rheumatism. I hope it may soon go any way for it cannot add much to your comfort.We have had six rainy days in succession here and I guess we shall have more of them. Nothing new or special about the meter but I fully expect to be East about it before the month is up, probably soon after the middle of the month.The leaves here are beginning to turn and to fall also—in a very few more weeks we shall be having cold weather again and the first thing we know sleighingGood luck to youYour friendRM BuckeSee notes Oct. 4 1888. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 1 October 1888"
