    "text": "Montenotte, CorkSept. 3, 1872My dear Mr. Whitman,I can hardly understand how I have left your most welcome letter so long unanswered. In Paris two months ago I saw one morning in a newspaper that \"The American Poet, Walt Whitman would shortly visit England\" & there & then I sat down & wrote part of a letter to you, but the weariness of illness (I was ailing a good deal) caused it to remain unended & unsent. Now I have just heard from Mr. Burroughs that there is, or may be, a fair chance of your coming to us, & of your giving readings from your poems. As far as my own opinion goes, I would say that there is a certainty of success, a sufficient success at the least, & perhaps a complete one, in Dublin. Do come. You do not know how welcome you would be to many of us. I need not say that if you would come to our house in Dublin my wife & I would be made abundantly happy, & would remember 1872 as a year good to think of.There are several things for which I owe you thanksâ€”two copies of \"Democratic Vistas\" & newspapers from time to time. Each I assure you has been valued, (though my thanks are tardy), & your letter has been read or heard of by those who would care for its contents.Mr Burroughs tells me that you have been not as well as heretofore since the great summer heat. I trust it is only a slight & temporary yielding of your health. You will be best able to feel yourself whether a run across the Atlantic, & the absorbing of new life & scenery in England & Ireland, would not be just the tonic you require. We at all events are interested in believing this, & think that you are just the communicator of vitality & joy that we require. I mean by this, besides its more direct personal meaning, that such influences as yours are precisely what our poetry in its latent developments needs to make it sane & masculine. And I have not a doubt that your personal presence in England would do much towards bringing the time when the recognition of your power & soundness in art & literature must become general.I have written to Mr Burroughs anything about myself that I thought would interest him, & I will not write the same again to you. Also I have sent him two or three things I have written & if he thinks you would care to see them he will give them to you.I will write to you again before long. I hope you will continue to let me see or hear of such things of yours as otherwise I might miss. \"The Mystic Trumpeter\" I was very glad to have seen. But chiefly I hope to hear that you are coming, & coming to us.My address is as before 50 Wellington Road,Dublin>This has been a year of comparative loss to me as regards physical health, but I am well again now & in other respects it has been a year of gain & progress. But I don't find in the least find[find in the least] that, with progress, I slip aside or away from your poems.I am, dear Mr WhitmanVery sincerely yours,Edward Dowden Edward Dowden to Walt Whitman, 3 September 1872"
