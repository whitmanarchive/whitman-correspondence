    "text": "340 Harrow RoadLondon W—Sept 1stDear Sir,I desire to bring under your notice the Christian Kingdom Society in the hope that you will sympathise with it—It is formed for the purpose of banding together people of different creeds, parties and countries, on the broad lines of loyalty to the Christian spirit. We do not enter into theological or ecclesiastical discussions, and we discourage all foolish disputations. We aim at bringing about those feelings of sympathy and goodwill among all people, for which you are also striving. It would be such a great pleasure to many of us to feel that although separated in many camps and living in many countries, we all belong to one great union—Should you feel that you can honestly accept our basis, it would be a great joy to some of us who have read your writings to have you also in our assocnassociation The idea of a great brotherhood—a kingdom, not confined by rivers, or mountains, or seas, but extending over all the earth, and embracing men of all nationalities, languages, & colors, comes like an inspiration to many—I shall be thankful for a card from you if you are interested in the SocySociety & wish to joinfaithfully yrsyoursAlex H. Smith Alex H. Smith to Walt Whitman, 1 September 1887"
