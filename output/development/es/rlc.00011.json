    "text": "431 Stevens st. Camden, N. Jersey, U.S. AmericaJune 11, '74. My dear Rudolf Schmidt,As you have rec'dreceived my letter of April 25, you know that the copies of Demokratisk–Fremblik and of some six newspapers with criticisms, safely reached me here—& one or two more since—& now, yesterday, Dags Telegrafen—all of which I treasure, & am to have carefully read to me. I am still unwell enough to make me remain here, quite idle, but am encouraged to still keep up the expectation of getting quite well—& indeed am improving, though slowly—I enclose a piece of mine just written for Commencement Poem to a College near Boston city—the College is the headquarters of the Universalists—my piece is to be read by proxy—I enclose you some pieces more on American humor, as you are interested in that subject—& a very amusing & 'cute letter by a lady about the darkeys down South—American humor, (like the old Greek, and now the best Italian, Spanish, French humor) is, in a sense the other side or opposite radiation of pensiveness, & even mystery & hypochondria—I think it more idiosyncratic & untranslatable than any I have mentioned, Greek, Italian, &c—It is entirely different from the English, or English–German—We have been having one of our American hot–weather spells—real hell–blasts—here lately—four, five, six days. But I have stood them very well indeed. To–dayToday as I sit here writing by the open window, there is a sufficiently cool breeze, & it is very agreeable & moderate, though just past noon. When you write mention whether you rec'dreceived Redwood Tree and also Prayer of Columbus, both sent March 4. (The address on the last papers & letters to me is exactly right, & is sure to reach me.) I intend to send Kristian Elster a copy of my poems, & my photograph—how shall I address him? John Burroughs has been to visit me here—he is settled on a little farm of his own on the Hudson river, 60 miles north of New York city. Your photo. sent in the letter of April 4 is before me as I write. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt, 11 June 1874"
