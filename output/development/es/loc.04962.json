    "text": "Anderton, near ChorleyLancashire, England16. Dec. 1890Dear Walt Whitman,Dr Johnston has told you about the \"Surprise Party\" he received on his birthday—the 8th inst!—I, myself, was unable to attend it, + Hulton is away from home at present, but all the rest of the friends were there + had a \"good time.\" One of our friends—W. Dixon—contributed two songs (with choruses) of which I afterwards asked for copies. I received them today + read them at noon for the first time. It occurred to me as I read them that they might possibly afford you a slight momentary amusement, + I will send them on with this. As you will see, they haven't much merit or value but you will note the reference to Dr Johnston's visit to you.One line saying that Dr. J. \"triumphantly has shown us a hair from off your beard!\" requires explanation. In a letter he received from you he saw (and appropriated) a white hair attached to the mucilage of the envelope.I hope that you are better than when you last wrote, and am anxious to hear a better report.The weather here has been very cold and frosty for a week back, and now threatens snow.With love and best wishes always,Yours affectionatelyJ. W. Wallace J.W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 16 December 1890"
