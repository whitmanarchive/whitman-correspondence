    "text": "Copy to go with notes Oct. 5, 188846 Marlborough HillSt. John's WoodLondon N.W.26 Sept. 1888Dear Walt Whitman:I have had it in my mind, concerning Leaves of Grass, to tell you a tale which will perhaps afford you a quiet moment's amusement now while you are preparing Autumn Boughs for us.Many years ago, probably about 1871, when the first enthusiasm for your wonderful book was on me;—the first & last enthusiasm, I should say, for it has endured uninterruptedly,—I was at the home of George Hry. Lewes & \"George Eliot,\" & was enjoying one of those short earnest tête-a-tête's that she found means to accord somehow to each of her room full of visitors.I asked her what she thought of L. of G.; & Lewes, coming up at the moment, remarked in his flippant way, \"Let me see, the author wrote Heel-taps, didn't he?\" Letting this poor jest pass, I pursued the serious talk with G. E.—found she knew hardly anything of L. of G., & urged her to read it. She said she had glanced at it but was impressed that it had \"no message for her soul\". I ventured a respectful demurrer & made way for the next tête-a-tête-ist. A few weeks afterwards, she sent me by young Lewes, who was then an official colleague of mine, a handsome and characteristic message. She had been reading Leaves of Grass; had found that the book had a \"message for her soul\" & thanked me for the part I had taken in pressing on her attention its scope, meaning, and original force. I do not pretend to quote her words except those in inverted commas. The rest were only reported to me by a tolerably inaccurate young man; but the drift was certainly as given above.Now I have often thought she must have made some such acknowledgment to you direct—seldom as she wrote to anyone in those \"Priory\" days. Did she or did she not?Always, dear Walt Whitmanmost sincerely yours,H. Buxton Forman.Forman put on margin above head of letter: \"Excuse the unreadableness of a scrawl written in the only available ¼ hour of the day, on the underground railway, with that most hateful of modern inventions a stylographic pen.\" Harry Buxton Forman to Walt Whitman, 26 September 1888"
