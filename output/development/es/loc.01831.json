    "text": "Attorney General's Office,WashingtonJuly 19, 1867.My dear Hiram Ramsdell:Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of 17th & we have had quite a talk —he seems to be a wide‑awake, candid young man, & makes a good impression upon me. He spoke of you, of his own affairs & fortunes, of Idaho, of Judge Kelly Holbrook, &c. &c.—In respect to Judge Kelly, & his matter, I had already formed my opinion & made out my Report several days ago—The Attorney General is full of anxiety & debate, on the big things that are up, just now, —& has not been able to hear the Report, & decide upon it—but he told me this morning he would try to do so very shortly—If he decides as I have advised him, you & Cummins will have no reason to be dissatisfied.—Dear friend, I rec'dreceived your note when you left here—it was sent on to me at Brooklyn.—I value George Alfred Townsend's appreciation of L. of G.Leaves of Grass It was magnificent. Where is Townsend now?—I hope it may happen one day that I may have him near at hand, that we get to be friends—such is in my mind.—There is nothing new in my affrairs—all goes on as usual in the office. I am well. After a hot spell of a week, during the last of June, we have had the finest kind of weather here the most of this month—Remembrance & love to you, wife & baby too.Farewell,Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Hiram J. Ramsdell, 19 July 1867"
