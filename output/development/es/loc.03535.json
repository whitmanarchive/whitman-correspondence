I have been about sick with a cold on my lungs, since after my days work was done I did not feel like writing.I hope you are enjoying good health this winter. I am going to give up my peuce the first of this. I dont think it avisable for me confine myself to a stone.My health will not admit of it. I RecReceived a letter from Miss Norwone last evening stating that her sister died last fall—I had not heard from her since I left Washington. How I pity her. Often when my mind back to the days that I spent in Armory Square, I can but cry. I often think I see her coming toward me, and the same sad smile on her countenance as in those days. I cannot tell how much I owe you & Miss Hroard for favor while in Hospital at Washington. I lost a very near and dear friend and Brother in the service of the United States and I know how to pity those that meet with similar losses.I cannot write more at present But beleive me sincerely your true Friend although I am far away from you.My Hearts desire is that you may live a long and happy life and when you leave this Earth you may be prepared for a better life—Hoping to hear from you soon I close please write soon—Jesse R.
