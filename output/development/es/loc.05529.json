    "text": "1882June 10th29 Lange StrasseDresdenMy dear WhitmanI learn to day to my great surprise that the Philistines are down on you again about the Children of Adam. What purblind asses! But there's no use in irritating oneself with thinking about it—only somehow every new instance of human folly and cant strikes one as something unexpected and bewildering; as if one hadn't had plenty of occasion to get accustomed to anything or everything in that line. I am sure it will do you more good than harm in the end. I am, sometime soon, to read something on the Leaves of Grass before a German audience, a 'Literary Club,' in Dresden. This will perhaps lead to my finding a collaborateur for the translation—said translation owing to press of other business has not been very rigorously pursued lately, but after this month I shall take off my coat to it again. You received some M.S.? A great event has lately happened in our home. I have become the father of a vigorous boy—our first-born; now some ten days old. \"Ay, madam—it is common\" but nevertheless it seems particular to me, naturally; and is altogether an enlivening and wonderful fact to us.What fearful doings in Ireland lately! I have a recantation to make to you on that subject. I remember once writing to you that Home Rule, or Separation, was in my opinion a chimerical & undesirable scheme for Ireland. Yet then, and always, that was the cause that had my affection & interest—only I saw such obstacles in the way, & foresaw such dangers to liberty if it were realized, that I could not go with it. Now all that has changed itself in my mind. I recognize now the deepseated expression of a national will in the movement. I see that the English can never govern us, & do worst when they mean best. And I see that the conflicts and miseries which I still believe to be inevitable on the fulfilment of the idea, will only be the (necessary) preludes towards a grander liberty and nationality than is at all within our reach now. I always abominated the English, and it is a great relief to me to find that I can support, with the feeling that I am doing right, the cause that I always sympathized with in my heart.—One thing is certain—these wretched outrages will cease instantly when Ireland has a government of her own. And that she will surely have, and I believe before long. If we only had arms we'd have a try when England gets into difficulties about this Egyptian business. (So unspeakably shameful to her, and more so to France). But I expect it will be \"constitutional\" measures for some time yet. Nothing perhaps does us more harm than your dynamite party in America.I hope you are well & strong now, & that you'll be well defended in your own country against this last outrage.Yours alwaysT W Rolleston. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 10 June [1882]"
