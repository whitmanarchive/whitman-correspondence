    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamdenAugust 18Dear friendYours of 2d just rec'dreceived (the one from Scotland came also)—I am pretty well—full as well as when I last saw you in New York—(if any thing perhaps a little plus)—I went down last month to spend a while with the Staffords at their new farm, but I miss'd my main attraction & comfort, the Creek, & did not make a long visit—Mrs S and the rest are as usual, except Debbie, who was not at all hearty—Brother & sister here well—sister seems to be engaged this morning with her new girl, (who seems to be doing marvellous!) in early fall house cleaning—at any rate I noticed every thing tumbled & heaped just now, as I have been down stairs to see what the post man left me—I am sitting up in my room Stevens Street writing this—copious rains all the morning, and last night—(& indeed this is the third day of them)—Hattie and Jessie left for St Louis last Thursday night—Lou and I went over to the West Phil:Philadelphia depot and saw them off—(dear girls, how we miss them)—I am busy a little leisurely writing—think of printing soon a smallish 100 page book of my accumulated memoranda down at the Creek, & across the Ferry, days & nights, under the title ofIdle Days & Nights of a half-Paralyticprose, free gossip mostly, (you saw some specimens in that Jersey letter, last winter in the Phila:Philadelphia Times)—Isn't that sad about the sudden death of our young Mr Sartoris in your country? Something strange too (I hope nothing uncanny will turn out)—Thank you, dear friend, for your letter—(came in just right)—how I should indeed like to see that Cathedral—I dont know which I should go for first, the Cathedral, or that baby—Best love to you—to Bee, Herb, Giddy and all—I write in haste but I am determined you shall have a word at least promptly in response— Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist, 18 August [1879]"
