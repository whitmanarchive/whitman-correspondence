    "text": "Dear WhitmanPlease pardon my intrusion but as I am a great lover of literature especially poetry, I have always taken great interest in you and your poems and other writings and am a great admirer of them,I have often looked for your photograph but have never succeeded in obtaining one and have no definite idea of your features. I have been much disappointed in not securing you photograph and concluded that, perhaps, I could procure one of you Have you a photograph of yourself which you could send me?I enclose you 25Â¢ for photograph if yopu have one which you are willing to send to me.I shall anciously await your reply and hope that you will be so kind as to send a photograph. I have long desired your opinion on several matters in literature but will only ask you one. I have read and studied Mr. Joaquin Miller's poems \"Songe[Songs] of the Sierras\" and have been greatly impressed by them. I am very curious to hear your opinions of him, and his poems. I shall be greatly indebted to you if you will give me an opinion of Mr/ Miller's work If you will be so kind as to answer my critical questions I will thank you very much.Will you if you are not occupied please write me with your own hand a copy of one of your poems?I do not wish to be a nuisance and a bore to you and if you have not plenty of leisure I will not ask for the poem I have poems in the handwriting of Bryant, Longfellow, Holmes and Whittier and with yours if you send it I will complete the series of the greatest American poets. If you do not wish to answer I will not be greatly surprised for I presume you are nearly bored to death by \"autograph friends\" but I write you as a lover of literature and am not to be classed with the \"friends\" in any sense.With best wishes for your health and prosperityI am always your friend and admirerBayard WymanPerry, Ohio Bayard Wyman to Walt Whitman"
