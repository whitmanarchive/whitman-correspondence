    "text": "CamdenSaturday noon July 13 '89 Cloudy (rainy last night)—Still hot—Still eat & sleep fairly— take the tonic—y'r letter ab't Mrs O'C rec'd—doubt whether it w'd suit her—such a plan—am not moved to it favorably—Most things are bad enough with me, but I am blessed thankful they are no worse & that I get along as well as I do—Am getting along better than you suppose—rec'd a letter I enclose it from John Burroughs. His address for twelve days will be Hobart N Y. The printing of Horace's little book is progressing—I am writing nothing—strech'd out on the bed half the time fanning away the flies &c—not down ill but not far from that—some blackberries & a rare egg for my breakfast—Sunset—Have had my supper & relish'd it—send this hence Camden (to Phila) 8 P M July 13—see & itemize to me, when it reaches you—over an hour's rain latter afternoon—I am feeling fairly—sweating—Well we must have a turn in the temperature presently—perhaps to-nightBest regards & love to Mrs. B and all—Walt WhitmanWest Park N.Y. July 12, 89 Dear Walt, I write you briefly this morning before starting on my 2 week vacation to Delaware Co. I rec'd the pocket book copy of L.G. & prize it very highly. It is unique, I was very sorry I could not see you on the day you was 70 years old. All that time I was having one of my streaks of insomnia, & was very wretched for two or three weeks. It has worn off & I am feeling much better.The summer has been a very busy one with me. The young grape vines grow so fast that it keeps me going to tie them up to the stakes. I go about all day with two balls of twine at my side, training the young vines in the way they should go, & tying them in that way.I do hope you keep about, I wish some good masculine angel would come & lift you out of Camden, bag & baggage & set you down here, or or by the sea, or in the mountains A change of air now would greatly add to the length of your days. You ought to know this, & I will not bore you with it. I hear from Horace now & then, always gladly. I have not seen O'Connor's reviews of Donnelly's Reviewers. If you have a copy send it to me at Hobart N.Y. & I will return it. With much love John Burroughs Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 13 July 1889"
