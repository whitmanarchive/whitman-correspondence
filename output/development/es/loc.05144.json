    "text": "'82October 2929 Lange Strasse Dresden'Specimen Days' safely arrived, a really beautiful book externally. Many, many thanks for the gift. I have been looking through it and find much that I had not seen anywhere before. I see you have put in your letter about the Russian translation, to Lee. Did I tell you—(or was it in the letter that went astray?) that Lee has got an appointment in England which will take up all his time except in vacations, for the present at any rate? I haven't heard from him now for months, though I wrote twice. I know he meant to go into Servia and Bosnia early this year & hope he hasn't got into any trouble there—he & a friend had a rather narrow escape for theretheir lives in those parts year before last. He is a great enthusiast for Panslavism, but brigands wouldn't respect that. My translation I hope to get finished by Spring. When it approaches completion I will lecture on it in the Literarischer Verein & see if I cannot induce any of the members of it to join me in preparing it for the press, revising, etc. Or do you know, by correspondence or otherwise, any competent German with whom you could put me in communication? Not yet however; it is best, I think, that I should have it all turned into literal effective German, the sense of leading words penetrated, etc. before we go at it together. It will much facilitate the work.To find one who will really cooperate with energy in giving a faithful presentment of your book will be difficult, for German literature (and art and all mental products) of this day is cramped by formalities and proprieties to an inconceivable extent—far more so than in England. Art in all branches is thought of as a technique—anything like strong individuality is despised—or if it happens to escape that fate is overtaken by a still worse one, in being lauded as if it were a piece of correct conventionalism like everything else. —I have known this with the L of G. This is the tone among those who take the lead in aesthetic matters, but there is a silent mass in the background whom I reckon on.Picture of you with the moth is the most perfect visible type of yryour looks I could imagine.T W Rolleston. Thomas W. H. Rolleston to Walt Whitman, 29 October 1882"
