I take no medicines at all—hardly any alcoholic drink—never beer—eat plain fare—never risk—the trick is to steer between that last mention'd need to keep the wolf away & the benefit of very light food—eating, wh' is decided for an old fellow—I enclose my latest pieces—(have not yet seen the Feb: Century but suppose the poemet is in it)—have just been engaged to write some little bits for Munyon's Illustrated World (monthly Phila)—will send you when printed—$10 each, one paid—So far have escaped the grip, (but I guess I have the am't of it in my physical brain already, & have had two years)—Alys Smith comes regularly, does me good to see her—She is the handsomest, healthiest best balanced young woman in the world known to me—have quite many visitors—sold a big book yesterday—God bless you & yours—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 31 January 1890"
