    "text": "Oskaloosa IowaMay 21—85Dear Sir: Have you any other volume published besides \"Leaves of Grass\" and \"Specimen Days & Collect\"? I have these two, and have been acquainted with your writings for some time, althoalthough but a young man as yet. I will be glad to procure any other volume you may have. I have seen in some public library (I think at Minneapolis and Cincinnati) a volume of biography, althoalthough it seems to me now there were two different ones. I would be pleased also to have a large picture of yourself, if any has ever been published. A cabinet photograph, at any rate. I will remit you whatever these may be worth. I understand you have no publisher now, althoalthough \"David McKay Phila.Philadelphia\" appears on the title page of your books—Awaiting with interest a line from you, I am Your Young Friend & Well-wisherSamuel B. WrightTo Walt Whitman:Camden N.J. Samuel B. Wright to Walt Whitman, 21 May 1885"
