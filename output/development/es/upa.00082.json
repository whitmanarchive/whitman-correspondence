    "text": "328 Mickle streetCamden New Jersey U S AmericaAug. 23 '86Dear HerbertThank you for the remittance of the £2 from Prof. Dowden—(& I deeply thank him also)—Of the Circular—Should you have them to spare, I should like a dozen copies—I have had a pretty good summer, so far—better than last summer—I drove down yesterday (Sunday) to Glendale & staid four or five hours—took dinner there—In general, matters there ab't as usual—Mrs. Stafford up & around, but not near as healthy & strong as I would like to see her—the rest all well—We talked of you—Address Wm D. O'Connor, Life Saving Service, Treasury Department, Washington D. C., U S America——I get letters from Dr. Bucke, who is home in London, Canada—I send enclosed a ¶ for your consideration for the book—I send my best love & thanks to you & Wm Rossetti.Walt WhitmanSome of her most beautiful, characteristic, interesting and copious letters were written to her friend Walt Whitman the American poet. I suggested to Mr. Whitman, the giving of these letters or rather extracts from them, for publication in the present volume. But the poet was not entirely favorable or willing. \"I do not know,\" he says in a late letter to me, \"that I can furnish any good reason, but I feel to keep these sweet utterances exclusively to myself. But I cannot let your book go to press without at least saying—and wishing it put on record—that among the perfect women I have known (and it has been my unspeakably good fortune to have had the very best for mother, sisters and friends) I have known none more perfect in every relation than my dear, dear friend Anne Gilchrist.\"Herbert, I am sorry not to be able to respond to your request for letters or the like —Can't you bring in this ¶ somewhere in the book? Walt Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist, 23 August 1886"
