    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden New JerseyMay 8 '81My dear Mr OsgoodI write in answer to the note on the other side from my dear friend O'Reilly—My plan is to have all my poems, down to date, comprised in one 12 mo: Volume, under the name \"Leaves of Grass\"—I think it will have to be in brevier (or bourgeois) solid—and I want as fine a (plain) specimen in type, paper, ink, binding, &c. as bookmaking can produce,—not for luxury however, but solid wear, use, reading, (to carry in the pocket, valise &c)—a book of about 400 pages to sell at $3—The text will be about the same as hitherto, occasional slight revisions, simplifications in punctuation &c—the main thing a more satisfactory consecutive order—a better ensemble, to suit me—some new pieces, perhaps 30 pages—Fair warning on one point—the old pieces, the sexuality ones, about which the original row was started & kept up so long, are all retained, & must go in the same as ever—Should you, upon this outline, wish to see the copy, I will place it in your hands with pleasure—Walt WhitmanThe Pilot Editorial Rooms.April 26.Dear W. Whitman Hope you got safe home. James R. Osgood want to see the material for your complete book. Can you let him have a look at it, or write him & tell him about it? Always faithfully yoursJohn Boyle O'Reilly Walt Whitman to James R. Osgood, 8 May 1881"
