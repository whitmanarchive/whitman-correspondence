    "text": "1873431 Stevens st. cor West.Camden, N.J.Dec.December 12.Dear boy Pete,I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes—& in such a sudden, cruel way—poor young man—he has had a reckless unsatisfactory life—many deficiencies & very shiftless—all of which I understood perfectly well—but I had an affection for him after all—Have I not heard that he had a wife & child? which, (if so,) he has left—but was parted from quite a while ago——Pete, so your shirts came all safe, & they fit you, do they?—good—The blue shirt (did I write?) is to wear over, loose—it is made large for that purpose—I like the looks of them, the blue shirt collar turned down low with a nice black silk neck handkerchief, tied loose—over a clean white shirt without necktie—I think they are very becoming to young working-men—I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. & Mrs. Nash—when you hear, tell me if they came safe.—I send you some papers to-day——There is nothing new with me, or my condition—My principal malady is about the same, (no worse)—but I have had for three or four days a wretched cold in the head, sore throat, most lost my voice for two days—every thing bad enough—am better rather to-day, begin to speak so I can be understood—shall be all right soon——As I write, it is now between 11 and 12 a.m. Friday—it is very mild, sunshiny forenoon—I am sitting here in the parlor,—looks south, looks down a pleasant street, West street, full view, makes quite a nice view for me to sit & look out—the letter carrier comes around in about an hour from now, & takes my letters to P.O.Post Office—I have become sort of acquainted with most of the carriers, ferry men, car conductors & drivers, &c. &c.—they are very good indeed—help me on & off the cars, here & in Philadelphia—they are nearly all young fellows—it all help[helps] along—Well Pete, dear loving boy, I will bid you good bye for this week. Walt Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 12 December [1873]"
