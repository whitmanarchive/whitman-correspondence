    "text": "WashingtonJune 9, 1865. My dear friend,The Homer has come & is now lying before me. I thank you deeply. I am very well, this summer, & go to the Hospitals daily & nightly—as I find a greater proportion of sad cases than ever—& for some reason or other there are few or no visitors. I enjoy my visits with a sad but profound joy & satisfaction—especially at night, when the light is nearly turned off, & I am soothing some suffering one.I send you, same mail with this, two copies of the little book Drum-Taps. Farewell.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to John Swinton (?), 9 June 1865"
