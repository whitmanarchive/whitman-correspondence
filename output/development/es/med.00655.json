    "text": "May 31, '82.From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly ten years ago, has since remain'dremained, with varying course—seems to have settled quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day—now and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles—live largely in the open air—am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)—keep up my activity and interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day. About two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains entirely unaffected; though physically I am a half-paralytic; and likely to be so, long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been accomplish'daccomplished—I have the most devoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate relatives—and of enemies I really make no account. Walt Whitman to Karl Knortz(?), 31 May 1882"
