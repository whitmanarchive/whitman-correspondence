Mother dear, I suppose you got the letter Tuesday—I am about the same—I have not gone over to the office to-day, & am writing this in my room—mother, I send only $15 in this—will send the other 5 in my next—Write and send me word, soon as convenient after you get this—I have not been feeling so well this forenoon, but feel better now—As I said before I have ups and downs—but steadily advance, quite certain, though very slowly—I seem to have a bad cold in my head—I am going to try to go out in the car, as the day is so pleasant and bright—Love to you & all, mother dear—Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 30 April [1873]"
