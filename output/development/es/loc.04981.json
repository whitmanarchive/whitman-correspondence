    "text": "RuskinRhys Longfellow Asylum for the Insane,London,2 oct 1885Dear WaltI have your card of last Wednesday I feel pretty concerned at your condition and wish more than ever that you had got up here last spring—we had such a cool summer here that unquestionably you would have been better here than in Camden. I am very anxious to see you and will do so as soon as I can get away from here—I think I told you I had four months holidays beginning 15th of the present month. Shortly after the 15th I hope to see you and then we shall see what can be done. Meantime please write to me as often as you can telling me how you keep.Affectionately yoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 2 October 1885"
