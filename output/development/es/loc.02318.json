I seem to be recovering—then fall back. This happens over & over again. Last Saturday was a remarkably good day with me—but since then every thing has changed for the worse—To-day is the third day I have had continuous successions of severe spells—blurs I call them—bad, bad enough.—Still, somehow, I think I am going to weather it—(though I understand perfectly well that I may not)—Write,—Come & see me.Walt Whitman431 Stevens st. cor West stCamden, N. JerseyNew JerseyIt is only 5 minutes from Philadelphia ferry, west of Market stDepartment of JusticeWashington........187I send my respects to Dr. & Mrs. Bielby.
