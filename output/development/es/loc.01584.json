    "text": "Sept 29.Dear boy Pete,It is splendid here to-day, & I am feeling first-rate. We have had quite a dark & rainy spell—but now the prospect is good weather, clear sky, bright sun, coolish, & no dust. I shall spend an hour or two on the river to-day. Your letter of 27th, Sunday, came this morning. Also two Stars, 25th & 26, the latter with Hinton's speech, the other containing an item about me. The previous Star arrived with your note of 23d, written just as you were going to see the Black Crook—& next morning another Star came. Peter, you are a good boy, & shall have your reward in Heaven, if not on earth. Now how about that cold? I see you went to work Saturday. You seem to be under the weather more than I thought. Dear comrade, I hope this will find you all right & well as ever. I suppose you are working this week. Yesterday I spent most of the day in Brooklyn helping the folks to finish up the moving business. Got through just after dark. I have not been to any amusements yet. Somehow I dont seem to care about them, & I go around enough during the day. There is considerable political excitement here—banners swung across the streets almost every block, & big transparences in front of the different headquarters. I have seen several splendid torch-light processions, & outdoor meetings, &c. Of course the great majority in New York & Brooklyn is for Seymour & Blair.To Jim Sorrell: Dear Jimmy: You may not understand it, what that lady said about the bedfellow business, but it's all right & regular—besides, I guess you understand it well enough. Jimmy, dear boy, I wish you was here with me—we could have such good times. I send you my love—& to Charley the same—Mention how Charley's young one is getting along—I will now bid you good bye for this time, my loving friend, & God bless you, dear comrade, & keep you all right. I will write a line to No. 6, & will speak to the other boys in my next. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 29 September [1868]"
