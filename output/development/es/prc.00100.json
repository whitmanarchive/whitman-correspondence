It is to be called Two Rivulets (i.e., two flowing chains of prose and verse, emanating the real and ideal), it will embody much that I had previously written. . . . but about one-third, as I guess, that is fresh. Leaves of Grass, proper, will remain as it is identically. The new volume will have nearly or quite as much matter as L. of G. (It is a sort of omnibus in which I have packed all the belated ones since the outset of the Leaves.) Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti (?), [May (?) 1875]"
