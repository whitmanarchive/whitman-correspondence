    "text": "The Camelot Series. Edited by Ernest Rhys. Walter Scott,Publisher,24 Warwick Lane,London, E.C.From ERNEST RHYSc/o Walter Scott,ToW. W.Camden,14th Aug. '89My dear Walt Whitman,Your welcome p'card of July 23rd reminds me how the time has slipped away since my last letter to you. I have now been here in North Wales for nearly six weeks, having retreated to these mountains very soon after returning from Paris. I am lodged very comfortably in the cottage of a quarry-man,—William Davies, who works at , 5 or 6 miles from here. He is a very good type,—healthy, well-built, good-natured, impulsive, with the over-carefulness of the average Welshman tempered by his experiences of American life, for \"he went to the States,\" as they say here, some years back, + travelled far + wide, working in mines + quarries. Even now he does not talk English very fluently, + prefers his native Welsh, in which he gives me lessons every night on his return from work. Many people in the district speak no English at all. The Welsh are a peculiarly adhesive race, + stick to their language + old customs, +, it must be added, to their money, with a somewhat dubious devotion. An infusion of American generosity + freedom would do them great good. As it is, + money-making is the formula of the lives of most of them,—their redeeming quality being their love of music + oratory!I found the change here from Paris very striking. The French are exactly opposite in every way,—those who live in Paris at any rate. There the sunshine + the gaiety + general friendliness are very pleasantly in contrast with the grey skies + the montonous[monotonous] routine of London. Paris is a sort of ideal New York,—a New York touched with Romance + the finer graces of the Past, but without the youthful ardency that pulses in Mannahatta. Paris would delight you greatly, I know, though you might have misgivings at last about a life so frivolously secular, so wanting (as it seemed to me) in humane + religious aims of the higher kind. But this notwithstanding, the charm of those sunny streets, + good-natured faces, is something to remember.The Exhibition, I daresay, you have heard enough of. What struck me most of all—much more than the Eiffel Tower + other nine-days wonders, was the endless cosmopolitan ebb + flow of the peoples of the world,—American, Arabian, Japanese, Indian, Egyptian, English, Norse:—a wonderful, undescribable Concourse de Monde!I must stop here to-day—Post-time!—hoping to take up the story at greater length shortly. Luck has been dead against me of late. I suppose I shall have to Quarry-man presently,—Scottish Art Review + other papers not paying up!With love + remembrances to Camden friends, yrs.Ernest Rhys Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 14 August 1889"
