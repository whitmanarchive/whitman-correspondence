    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,9 July 1888I read pp 68, 69, 70 of the book (on slang) with great delight—have never seen it before—must be printing now from M.S.? I hope there is a lot more of it, it is one of the best, most original, prose things of yours I have seen so far. I have your letter of the 5th & 6th. I fear you are not having a good time but it is a great comfort to me to know that you are at least being looked after—in this regard I feel sure nothing could be better than Baker & Traubel and I think we are most fortunate in getting the assistance of these two young fellows. Yes, as you imagine I am indeed up to my eyes in work but one thing I am glad of—I have got over the engagement I had with Pardee to go to Chicago and shall be here all the time now and so on hand in case I should require to go to Philadelphia.The weather here keeps extremely pleasant, warm (not hot) generally bright, refreshing showers from time to time—we are cutting our hay. Had the last of our strawberries and the first of our currants today All goes well with us.Your loving friendRM BuckeSee notes Aug 19 '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 9 July 1888"
