    "text": "BelmontMy Dear Walter (as poor Emerson wdwould say)I some weeks ago devised a cunning scheme for getting a call, or visit from you in spite of yourself, & at same time putting a couple of hundred dollars into your pocket. Shortly after you had yryour sun-stroke I went in & called on O'Reilly, & asked him if we cdcould not manage to call the attention of some good government friend of yrsyours to the amazing fact that the deserving veteran of the war has never rec'd from an ungrateful country any adequate quid pro quo, for his services. (I thought—there might be some office for you, with nominal services, wh. you might accept)O'Reilly during the conversation said he wished we could get you on to Boston to lecture or read about October 1st or 5th (say). I took up the idea & having my time at my disposal, I am going to work you up a lecture. Have seen Bartlett (T.H.) & only await a letter from you to start me off advertising & printing tickets & seeing the Papyrus & other club men, &c &c.Do you think you will be able to come by that time, my dear friend? I have never heard you either read or lecture & shall be a thousand times repaid for my trouble.aff—W.S. KennedyThanks for poems (19th Cent) & Theatre. reminiscence piece. \"Last of Ebb\" is my favorite. William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 28 August 1888"
