    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,21 Sept 1888Yours of 18th & 19th to hand, enclosing Herald scrap and Logan Smith's letter. Thanks for all. All quiet here and nothing new. I guess things are pretty quiet, not to say dull, with you. You will very soon now have your autographing to do, quite a job for you I should think (?). Annual Fair begins in London today so no doubt we shall have enough visitors for the next week or ten days. I expect W. Gurd (and my boys) home this evening—guess we shall be able to move ahead with meter now. A certain little hitch there was seems to be got over all O.K.We are talking of having a copy made (or get a casting) of your (Sidney Morse) bust and putting it in our new (big) amusement room (now building)—hope we shall be able to manage it. It would go over the front of store (the plan was to put Shakespeare there but as we cannot be sure of his likeness and can be of yours we think of this change).Mrs Bucke and children all well—we are all enjoying the quiet autumn days, and the good fresh fruit and vegetables from our orchards & gardens—we have never had a more plentiful season.Love to youRM BuckeSee notes Sept. 24, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 21 September 1888"
