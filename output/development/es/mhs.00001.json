    "text": "St. Louis, Mo.,Jan. 26th, 1888My dear JessieMy darling girl, I enclose you a check for $50, hoping it will reach you before you leave BurlingtonI got home from Ark yesterday, after a pretty hard time—I had to abandon my Texas trip for the reason that I had some bids here to be opened on Monday  I did not get here till Wednesday—but that was owing to the weather and the Rail Roads  I shall go out to the cemetery on Sunday and leave Sunday night for Texas. I suppose I shall be gone about a week  Mr Smith of Leavenworth was at my office on Monday last and came for the express purpose of carrying me off to New York all expenses paid—but of course I could not go—much as I wanted to—No I must make the best of what is wanted now—I presume I shall have lots of time after awhile—Well my dear girl I wish you would go and do just what gives you the most fun—and I do hope you will make fast friends of the New York and Hartford people—they are good folk to knowI shall write Horace that you are at Worthens after the 1st for ten days—I think he will call and ask you to go to his place—and if he does I would like to have you goNothing new with me—I am feeling fairly well—except I have my old terrible cough—it is pulling me down some—but I shall get out all right when the spring comesWish you would go and see Walt as often as you canLove to allaffectionately Papa Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Jessie Louisa Whitman, 26 January 1888"
