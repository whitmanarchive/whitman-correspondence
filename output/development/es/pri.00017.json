My dear friend, I authoriseauthorize you to make any arrangement about publishing, terms, &c. you think best—only the books must be printed verbatim & entire, if at all, & in Two Volumes—(You will see what I have authorized to be put at bottom of title pages.) Dowden wrote to me lately a word on this matter, relating however only to Two Rivulets (proposed Chatto. & Windus, at a venture)—I shall tell D.Dowden that I have placed these copies in your hands—& shall (if you have no objection) consider him to be join'djoined with you in the matter of deciding, negotiating, terms, &c. of the publishing, (should such come to pass)—& whatever you twain think well to do, under those conditions, in said matter, I hereby warrant & endorse. Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William Michael Rossetti, 29 March 1876"
