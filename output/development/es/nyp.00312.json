    "text": "Wednesday noon Feb. 26. Dearest mother,I am getting along real well, upon the whole—I went out and over to the office yesterday— went in & sat down at my desk a few minutes—It was my greatest effort yet, and I was afraid I had overshot the mark again, as I felt dizzy & tired last night— But to-day I feel getting along all right—I am going out a little to-day, but not much— I feel now over the worst of my bit of sickness, & comparatively comfortable— Poor Martha—the thoughts of her still come up in my mind, as I sit here a great deal of the time alone—Poor Jeff, & poor children too— I have received a letter from Lillie Townsend—Aunt Sally is still living and well as usual, & nothing very new— I have just got a second note from Mrs. Price— Mother, I shall try to get out, & get my Feb. pay, I have to get it from the old office, & then I will send you your $20. (I hope within a couple of days, or three at most)— I expect Mrs. Burroughs here probably to-day with a carriage to take me out riding—so you see I am beginning to sport around— Every thing here now is inauguration—& will be till the 4th of March is over— for my part I want to get out of the way of it all— Love to you, mammy dear, & to Georgey & Lou & all—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 26 February [1873]"
