    "text": "Friend Walt,I have been setting at the foot of what I call my bed idoly[idly] speculating, on the past, and thinking of many men I have met and called them Friends how often the word Friend, is missplace[misplace], but you have told me you were my Friend and called me your young Friend, I thank you for that priveledge[privilege] from the inmost recess of my heart as I know you can appreciate a sincere Friend, and I will try to be that to you. I gave Father one of your ambrotypes when I was at home, he was very much pleased with it, and reconised[recognized] it at once. My little Wife exclaimes[exclaims], he looks like a very inteligent[intelligent] and kind hearted Old Gentleman, when I gave her the presents you sent her, she said tell him Andy when you see him that although his gifts are small and he is an entire stranger to me I appreciate them very much, as you say he is a warm and good Friend of yours I respect all of your sincere and good Friends, Walt, I stopped at your residence when passing through Washington en route to join my Regiment, and was told that you had gone on a visit to the Army, thinking that you had thought, that I had neglected to call upon you as I promised, I thought you might have gone out to visit me at my camp, expecting to meet you there I was sorrowfully disapointed[disppointed] on my arrival there to find that my conjectures were without foundation. Walt, I would invite you to visite[visit] me here at Camp but I am told that I will be sent home in a few days with the reenlisted men, to remain there for the term of Thirty-five days, if it proves to be the truth I will stop and try to persuade you to go on to New York with me, and visit my little Wife and my home, to enjoy a few of your leisure hours cheerfully. I will now conclude Walt, as it is quite late, asking you to please excuse this scratch, as I have a very sharp pointed pen and my ink is frozen. I will now bid adieu,Remaining Your Affectionate Friend,Lieut. Commanding Co 1, 1st Regt Excelsior Brigade, 2nd Division, 3rd Corps, Army of the Potomac Andrew J. Liebenau to Walt Whitman, 20 February 1864"
