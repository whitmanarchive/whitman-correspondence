    "text": "Dear Walt,Your welcom[welcome] letter of the 27th I recd Tuesday but did not feel in a writing moode[mood], so I have delayed it until now. I do not know but you think me rather neglectful in my writing to you but if you knew the pain that I have in my head, the whole of the time you would not think hard of me.Walt—I am sorry that I am as feeble, and that my friends and likewise my Doctor think that I never shall be able to join my Regt, it is hard for me to gaze or to think of the future, dark clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not seem to remove them nor hide them from my mind, I have tried to look on the bright side of the picture, but Walt—how can I look on the bright side when they are both dark Walt—I have been verry[very] low since I have been at home, and all that has saved me is good nursing and some one to cheer me (which two things I have had) and now and then a letter from you. I must tell you who I have had to cheer and nurse me, besides my parents and sisters: is a young Lady whom I think the world of, yes : might as well tell you, that it is one I love. I feel she has saved me, in the worst of my sickness she hardly left my room how often have I thought what would become of me if it were not for her.Tuesday, she whent[went] to V[ermon]t on a visit and will not be at home for several weeks, so I want you to write to her for Walt—she is one of the best Ladies in the world. I wish you could see her for I know you would like her and I know you will think a great deal of her for her taking such care of me promise me you will write to her, for it used to make her happy to read one of your letters to me  her address is Nellie F. Clark West Hartford Vt.I will now close hoping to hear from you soon I am yours with love and respect Caleb H. Babbitt to Walt Whitman, 18 October 1863"
