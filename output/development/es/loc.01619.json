    "text": "38 Marlborough HillSt John's WoodLondon, N. W.21 Feb. 72Dear Sir,I send herewith, by book post, a short poem called \"The Great Peace–Maker,\" which I have just edited for private distribution.As a constant reader and great admirer of your poetry, I have had the idea that the practical element in this poem, and also its fervent aspiration after the good of mankind, may commend themselves to you,—while a poem more like the rest of our contemporary verse might not.Believe me to bedear sirfaithfully yours,H. Buxton FormanWalt Whitman EsqP. S. I have been a long time trying to persuade one or another of our publishers to print a complete English edition of your works—verbatim, without any retrenchments; and I have gone so far as to offer my poor services in justifying, as far as criticism can justify poetry, those portions which they take exception to, or fear to print. Supposing I ultimately succeeded, would a verbatim reprint of the latest edition, with an introductory essay, have your approval?H Buxton FormanFeb 21 '72 H. Buxton Forman to Walt Whitman, 21 February 1872"
