    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,28th May 1883My dear WaltI have had the book a couple of days and have looked through it, I believe it will do, and if it will the Editor will deserve more credit than the Author—I am really surprised at the tact and judgement you have displayed in putting my rough M.S. into shape and I am more than satisfied with all you have done—I see now that you were right about the Latin motto (as about every thing else)—it is not in line with the book and is better out of it. I should like to know who will be the English Pubrpublisher and when the book will be published in England and when here? I suppose McKay will send me a statement (all in good time) showing my financial position as toward the vol.?We are all well here, the season is backward, the leaves not fully out yet; indeed the oaks and even some of the maples and elms have scarcely begun to come out yet—however the asylum grounds look lovely, we have had a great deal of rain and the grass and the young leaves are exquisitely fresh and greenAffectionately YoursR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 May 1883"
