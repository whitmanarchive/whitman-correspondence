[—] We are having quite spring like weather here, warm & bright. This evening it looks a little like rain, by all appearance we shall have an early spring—our grounds are already full of robins—in the early morning they sing as if it was the middle of april.I send you today a piece I wrote for an uncle more than thirty years ago about my old wanderings in the States 53–58 [/] I do not know whether you ever saw it [/] if not it may amuse you for a few minutes. I promised Horace to send him a copy of my Saguenay poem but please tell him I cannot find one and fear they are all gone.I am hard at work getting into the run of things after by absence [/] in another day or two it will be just as if I had been here all the time.We are all well, the health of the institution is first class. My Annual Report is out—I have written for some copies and shall send you one as soon as I get themI am reading nothing, far too busy, feeling first rateLove to youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 March 1889"
