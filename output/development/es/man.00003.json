    "text": "Asylum for the Insane,London,FebFebruary 3d 1880My dear WaltI have Burrough's book and also his last article in \"Birds & Poets\". I have O'Connor's \"Good Gray Poet\" parts of which are beautifull[beautiful]—I have Mrs. Gilchrists[Gilchrist's] letter in the \"Radical.\" All these and anything else I can get on this subject are interesting, and will be more or less usefull[useful], to me—but what I specially want just now is new facts about the man—both bearing upon his inward and outward life—I hope you will give me any help in reason that you can in this direction.I hope that your brothers will do something for me and I hope that if you have any thing to say about it you will encourage them to do something—I will return the little pamphlet after awhile meantime I will take good care of it & be sure not to lose it.Yours alwaysR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 3 February 1880"
