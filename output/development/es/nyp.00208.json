Dearest mother,I rec'd your letter of last Thursday—I suppose you got one from me the Saturday before, with some envelopes in, & $1—Well, mother, you have got a letter from that good for nothing pup again—it is too bad to be worried so—but one is powerless to do any thing, under present circumstances—I hope George will do well, in the houses, if he & the others put them up on Portland av.—I see there are cases of cholera once in a while in New York—you must all be careful of yourselves—it is very healthy here this summer—I havn't[haven't] been troubled by the heat yet—my head is much better—Mother, I must tell you I am having some new shirts made—quite an event—I can't hardly believe it when I think how those old ones you fixed, & fixed again, have held out—but, poor old things, they have got played out pretty well—why I believe I have got one or two that you fixed for me when I went to Boston there six years ago, & more—I have 'em made in the same way as ever, & I think they are going to be very good—I expect to have half a dozen—so you see I am coming out—had quite a clearing out the other day, collected all my old tattered duds & socks, & boots & slippers &c &c. into a great heap—and when Sally, our black girl, brought up my breakfast, I told her she could have 'em all, if she wanted 'em—she was most tickled to death—took 'em all off home—there was nothing but what was all give out, though—There is nothing new with me in my affairs—if things would only work so that I could get a higher grade, with more pay, it would come very acceptable—but here I remain, in the same way as at first—however I am very glad to have what I have—Tell Jeff I should like to see him very much—I think he would find it pleasant to come here for a few days, even this season—Well, dear mother, my sheet is full—love to all—Walt. Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 12 June 1866"
