After Freiligraths death I know of no countryman of mine, who would be able to give a good translation of your poetry. Perhaps you know of a german friend, who would like & be able, do do the translation? You would very much oblige me, by letting me know, the adress[address] of such a man,—he may be in the U. S or in Germany. With the sincerest wishes for you I remain yours trulyR. LUTZ, RedakteurRob. Lutz Robert Lutz to Walt Whitman, 9 June 1885"
