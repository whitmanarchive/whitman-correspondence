    "text": "Concord Mass:MassachusettsSept:September 18'81Dear Sister LouI still remain well—Am out here in Concord on a visit—spent last evening with MrMr. Emerson very pleasantly indeed—am to take dinner with him to-day—Every thing very agreeable here—I am at F B Sanborn's—(the little picture at the top is the house)—as I write (Sunday forenoon 11 o'clock) I look out on the Concord river—something like the Schuylkill—The book is almost finished—I am on the last pages of the proof—will be ready in the stores ab'tabout last of October—will be issued first in England, to secure the copyright there—as that is required, & I consider it important—Shall leave here (Boston) in about ten days—(perhaps less)—expect to stop in New York probably a week or so, & then on home—I sent your letter to Mrs. Gilchrist—I have not written yet—it is so sudden & dreadful—I thought I would wait a while—rec'dreceived your letter & as always was glad to get it—it is a sunny, Indian summery spell of weather here now, cool enough, but just suits me—I go back to Boston probably to-morrow—Yes I rec'dreceived the wedding invitation cards from Mr [&] Mrs Elverson for Alice & the happy (proposed) bride groom—I think him a lucky man—Well I must close at once, for here comes a fine lively team of white horses to take me out to ride, to be driven by the owner, Miss Mann, herself—With love as always—Brother Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman, 18 September 1881"
