    "text": "56 Euston Sq.London, N.W.8 Oct.Dear Mr. Whitman,I was extremely obliged to you for the present of your photograph & books; the vol. of poems containing (what I now read for the first time in that stage) the important section of Passage to India, & many modifications here & there in other compositions. It happens that I have lately been compiling a vol. of selections from American Poets, & I had had to use your earlier editions for the purposes of this compilation: but I have now set those aside, & used your new edition throughout—so the kind & welcome gift came to me at a very apposite moment. I confess to a certain reluctance to lose the old title \"A Voice out of the Sea\" of that most splendid poem (rated by most of your English admirers, I observe, as the finest of all, tho[though] I am not prepared to acquiesce in that estimate): however, in this, as all others where the editions differ, I have followed your new edition. Many thanks also for the separate poem subsequently received \"After all, not to create only\"—replete with important truths.—I don't well know when my \"American Selection\" will be out: my work on it is done, & the rest depends on the printer & publisher. I shall hope to beg your acceptance of a copy in due course.I sent on the copy of your works transmitted for \"The Lady\" after some little delay occasioned by my being absent from England up to the end of August. She was (& I think still is) in the country: but, to judge from a letter of acknowledgement she wrote me, you have probably this time heard from her direct. I know also that you have heard from Prof. Dowden, the writer of the article in the Westminster.Mr. Burroughs called here on 5 Octr., & is to dine with us tomorrow: I like his frank manly aspect & tone, and need not say that you were a principal subject of conversation between us. He seems very considerably impressed with the objects & matter of interest in London: I wish it might be my good fortune to see you here also some day[someday]. RumoursRumors of your projected arrival have been rife for some while past, but, as I learn from Burroughs, the prospect is as yet not a very definite one.Believe meMost respectfully your friend,W. M. Rossetti. William Michael Rossetti to Walt Whitman, 8 October [1871]"
