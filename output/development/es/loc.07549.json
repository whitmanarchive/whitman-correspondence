He has done little work since completing his last book \"November Boughs.\"Phil: Record Nov 24As I write Ed W is making up the bed—he is a good nurse to me & does well—I believe the big book is ab't done, & soon the binders will go at it—All I have meant in it is (as I have before told you) to make the completed, authenticated (& personal) edition of my utterances—a system of which L of G is the centre & source—Shall of course send you one of the earliest copies—tho' you may be here personally & receive one—wh' will be better still—Have spent a couple of hours with Addington Symonds's \"Greek Poets\" and the Bible—full of meat to me, both of them—Have read Boswell's Johnson—also a long collation & brief Biog: of Kant in Prof: Hedge's \"Prose Writers of Germany\" (a big valuable book)—1.40 P M—Yours of 22d just come—Sorry, sadly sorry, ab't Pardee—the direction is Hamlin Garland, Jamaica Plain, Mass:—I have not heard lately from O'C—Have had a currying & bath—the sun came out an hour ago, but has gone under & every thing looks glum & cloudy—good blazing sputtering oak fire—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Richard Maurice Bucke, 24 November 1888"
