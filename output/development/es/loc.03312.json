    "text": "Third letter from Ernest Rhys—the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, & the whole edition (10.000) sold.return no hurry59 Cheyne WalkChelsea,London, S. W.25th September 1885Dear Walt Whitman, Twice I have written to you before,—and whether my letters have ever reached you, or whether you have had other nobler & more important thing to prevent your attending to mere secondary matters, or—whatever the reason may be—(and indeed I know how many reasons, remembering too that you have been ill this summer, there are for it). I have waited very anxiously for a reply so far in vain. You know this anxiety,—of a young man, in the first hard fight of life & poetry in a great careless town, rebuffed over & over, coming almost every day—to all appearance otherwise—to his last penny. Not that I wish to pretend to any great misery—for perhaps there never was a happier life than mine, in most ways—; but disclosing my present standpoint, at odds with the fortunate ordinary aspects, you may be more ready to give me your helping hand of comradeship & cheer. The exact nature of the help you can give is this,—(as perhaps I ought to assume you know already, unless my former letters have not reached you)—the giving permission for a new & cheap edition of Leaves of Grass in England. The conditions of the Series of poets in which it is proposed to include your name are not altogether satisfactory may be; certain details are rather out of keeping with the tremendous scheme & infinite scope of the Leaves of Grass. But at the same time there are advantages in such an association which can not be overlooked, as for instance the immediately extended audience which is obtained by the appearance in a popular series of this sort. The more incompatible features of the edition, —such as red-line borders, prettified cover & so on, we must insist on having done away with in the case of the Leaves of Grass volume; and indeed I think if you strongly expressed your disapproval of the general conditions of the series, at the same time not objecting to the most urgent part of the request—for a cheap edition simply that is—I think the publishers would be persuaded to issue the volume specially & by itself, as a small square volume with plain cover & simply the emblem of a tuft of grass, and this would be a size & shape which could be easily carried about anywhere in the pocket. (My own copy of Leaves of Grass [Philadelphia, 1883 edit'nedition] I have taken to pieces & carry the different parts as I may want them about in a little parchment wallet; for the whole book is too big to be conveniently pocketed.) The publishers have asked me to forward you as a proof of their honourable intention ten guineas, and I am sure if the edition proved successful they would readily repeat the remittance. Last week I saw William Rossetti, & he advised me to send the amount through the Post Office, which I will do accordingly early1 next week. William Rossetti said he thought the proposed editnedition very desirable, and was altogether so kind that I felt a good deal cheered (though we only had a moment or two's talk) & determined to consult him again as the arrangements progressed. Last Sunday as a further step I lectured on Leaves of Grass, as you will see by the bill enclosed, in Islington, north London, & thanks to my subject, the adventure was successful, & I have been asked to redeliver the lecture in two other places. We had been threatened beforehand with a fierce opposition, but to our surprise it utterly collapsed after the lecture, & one lady present spoke with enthusiasm on the right side. For my own part I can't tell you with what elation & pride I recited some or the noblest passages in Leaves of Grass—firing them off as it were into the enemy's camp like the rifles Ruskin calls them. 29th Sept:—This is my chief claim to be your interpreter at all in England then—that I stand with the band of young men who have the future in their hands, young men of the people, not academics; not mere University students, but a healthy, determined, hearty band of comrades, seeking amid all their errors & foolishnesses to help the average, everyday men about them. You could have a thousand writers of more culture & literary student faculty than mine, but none I think with more love & enthusiasm & heat of youth. So far my accomplishments in life & song has not been much, having struggled through endless phases of literary tradition, being too occupied with the mining of coal & the living of a free open-air country life in the North. But give me your word, and I will try not to be unworthy of it. There is a temptation to say more about myself in the past & present, but perhaps it's better not to, especially as before long I may be able to send you a book,—\"The Book of Browney Valley,\" (Browney being the name of the little river by which I lived for some years,) which will tell what is to be told at length. Now, on the banks of the Thames, whose current, & craft of all kinds—sailing, steaming, rowing—, are fresh every morning to this attic window. I gather with tremendous zest materials for a larger volume,—The Book of Thames Valley, which will owe to Leave of Grass more than I can well say. Ah, I often wonder what your days are like in Camden,—how the sun shines, how the winds visit you,—wonder too whether you would mind if one day yet another young messenger came with some English leaves of grass in his hand for a token to your door. Only before that there's a great deal I must do, for tonight remembering that admonitant voice in Calamus. I seem a very poor & weak & inefficient follower. But \"Therefore release me & depart on your way,\" as ominously runs the last line I will not! I shall wait very eagerly for some word from you; with great love (in which William Rossetti asked to be included) from this London nook of the world, FaithfullyErnest RhysP O order for 10 LGs enclosed Ernest Rhys to Walt Whitman, 25 September 1885"
