    "text": "Exeter N. H.,Sep 14 1871Dear Sir I have just got your complete works Ed. 1871 and would like to ask you why you did not reprint the preface to the first edition? I have only read extracts from that preface and should like to have seen the whole reprinted. I suppose I can not get the old Ed now at the stores.I saw the other day that Mr. Swinburne said he enjoyed your \"Song of the Sea\" more than any of your works. Did he mean Sea Shore Memories No 1—?The poem of yours that I read over with the most satisfaction is your Burial Hymn of Lincoln. But as my opinion is not worth anything, being a boy, I should not have entrudedintruded it upon you. If you are pressed by time, even then I should like to hear from you—just a word. Yours most respectfully,Philip HaleP. S. Do you know where I could get a 1st Ed with preface? Philip Hale to Walt Whitman, 14 September 1871"
