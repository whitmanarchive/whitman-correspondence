If so, let them go—I wanted to go on record embalming (as much as I could) my tribute of dear W's memory & past. Y'r letter to-day is the first I have heard f'm you in two months & over—Dr Bucke is well & busy—I hear f'm him often. I continue on ab't the same—slowly letting down peg after peg—my mind & my right arm remain'g abt the same—I want to finish & print a 2d little annex (the last) to L. of G.I am sitting in my room in Mickle Street in the big old ratan chair with wolf-skin spread on back—have a little fire in stove—cool weather—bright sun out—was taken out in wheel chair yesterday afternoon—What is doing—or what has been done—abt the book of tales &c:?—John Burroughs has just been to see me—He, wife & boy still on their Hudson river farmBest respects & loveWalt Whitmanlater—afternoon—Yr 2d letter just rec'd & I see you have the Preface slip—but perhaps may as well send this yet. Bright sunny day but cool—the grip has hold of me pretty badlywouldn'tTheBrazenAndroidandotherTalesBy &c: &c:merely be as good a title as any? Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 29 September 1890"
