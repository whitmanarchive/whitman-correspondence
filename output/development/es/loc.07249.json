    "text": "Superintendent's Office. ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON.ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,28 Sept 1888I have your good letter of 25 & 26 inst. I note all you say about my \"W.W\" Your wishes will be religiously respected I did think of considerable changes (for I am certain the book will sell by & by) but was never set on them and less so lately. Yes, I shall leave it stand as it is and add under a later date what else I may have to say. I am glad Dr. Osler has been to see you again, I do not think the pain you speak of means anything serious, though no doubt it is annoying—I hope it is gone by now. Have to go to go to the city in a few minutes shall take this in and post it some men (capitalists) coming this afternoon to see the meter shall tell you tomorrow whether we succeed in doing any business with them. We are moving slow just now—feeling our way—we hope to be in a positon soon to launch outYour friendRM BuckeSee notes Oct 3, '88 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 September 1888"
