    "text": "Brooklyn24th Sept 1863Dear brother Walt,The enclosed $25 is from Joseph P. Davis making with the $25 sent you last Tuesday $50 from Jo. Now I will give you a statement of the whole affair  Last Monday I received a letter from W. S. Davis, Jo's brother [at?] Worcester, Mass. saying that he had received a letter from Joe directing him to send me $70. $50 to be sent to you and $20 to be expended in buying a present for young \"Joe Probasco.\" The $25 I sent you on Tuesday I borrowed of Mr Lane so that I might send it immediately and to day I received a check for the $70. I have paid Mr Lane the $25 and according to Jo's direction send you the remaind[er] of the $50.Jo's brother, W. S. Davis, is a lawer[lawyer], in Worcester, with a large number of acquaintances and I think liberal. I wrote him a note acknowledging the recipt[receipt] of the money and telling him that you would write him a long letter, detailing the manner, style, &c &c of your dispensing the money (like those you used to write us)  ask him to show it to his friends and get them to give what they can and have him send it to you  He writes me that he wants you to acknowledge the receipt of the money, and also that he would much like to hear from you. I consider it an opportunity for you to make this $50 the father of 100's without in the least seeming like one asking for itI certainly think Mother is following a mistaken notion of ecomony[economy]. I think the only decent meals that any of them have had for three months is what they have eaten with Mat and I. As regards Mother I am perfectly willing she should live with us all [the time?] (that is to eat, I mean) but Ed and Jess I cant stand entirely. Dont[Don't] understand me that they do eat with us, for they dont[don't] as much perhaps as they used to. Mother certainly does not, not as much as we wish her to, for we always call her. I notice however that when Jess does eat with us that he does not throw up his victuals. And Andrew too, his trouble comes as much from his mode of living and sleeping  His room for sleeping is without ventilation. the window is coverd[covered] with posiness[poisonous] tress. He has no nice little things, [or] all nourishment fixed for him to eat, such as I intended Mat should fix for him. I dont[don't] think myself that we have any thing to do with Nancy, she is able enough to make a good living both for herself and the children, if she wasnt[wasn't] so dam'd[damned] lazy.Walt I wish you was home for awhile. I think you would see and think as I do. I have scribbled this to you just as I have thought for a day or two. Ruggles says that Andrew cannot be a well man in this town, to be sure even going away may not help him, but he thinks and is almost certain that it will. I wish if you dont[don't] come on you would write me also write Andrew. Oh you dont[don't] know how down spirited he isJeff. Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 24 September 1863"
