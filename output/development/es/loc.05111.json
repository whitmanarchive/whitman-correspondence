    "text": "[London,]May 22d [188]1Dear WaltI was in hopes we should have seen you here before this time—our grounds are beautifullbeautiful now, the trees are just in full leaf and they have that delicate fresh look which is so charming—the place is full of birds singing from early daylight all day long. A great many of your friends here are looking out anxiously for you (I have told them I expected you). I hope your health is not worse—I must say I am more afraid of that old complaint (something like laziness) keeping you away from us, than I am of your bodily health. But if you are still unwell remember that is all the more reason you should come here. I wish you would drop me a postcard. I am getting anxious about youR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 22 May 1881"
