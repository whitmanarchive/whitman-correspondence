    "text": "Aug 9 '78My dear TennysonThe last letter I sent you was Sept 14 '76, (nearly two years ago) to which I have received no response. I also sent my Two Vols: new edition—having rec'dreceived your subscription of 5£ (with an intimation from Robert Buchanan that no books were expected in return—but I preferr'd to send them)—I am still in the land of the living—much better & robuster the last two years, & especially the last six months, (though a partial paralytic yet)—I find the experiences of invalidism & the loosing of corporeal ties not without their advantages, at last, if one reserve enough physique to as it were confront the invalidism But all this summer I have been & am well enough to be out on the water or down in the fields & woods of the country more than half the time and am quite hefty (as we say here) and sunburnt.Best regards & love to you, dear friend. Write me first leisure & opportunity. Havn't you a son, lately married I have heard about?—Pray tell me something about him—& the respected lady, your wife, whom you mention'd in your last as prostrated with illness—& yourself most of allWalt WhitmanSent to Tennyson | Aug 9 '78 | Aldworth | Blackdown | Haslemere | (or elsewhere) | England Walt Whitman to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, 9 August 1878"
