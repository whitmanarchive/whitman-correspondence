    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylum for the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,30 Oct 1889Ed. Wilkins turned up last evening with the parcel of photos, prints &c fourteen in all, a grand collection, some of them I had not seen before or not in that shape. They make an immensely valuable addition to my \"W.W. Collection\" and I am wonderfully pleased to have them and thank you a thousand times. I go to Guelph—Ont. this evening to attend a murder trial, shall be back tomorrow evening. Ed. gave a very good account of you all, I had not time to talk to him much (a lot of people at the home) but he is coming soon to see me again. He seemed sorry to leave Camden but thought he ought to be at his studies. A very encouraging letter from Willy Gurd—All going well with him and the meter there in Danbury, Conn. and he hopes to be quite through very soon now. Cloudy but pleasant weather. Not cold.Affectionately yoursR M Buckesee notes | Nov 1 '89 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 30 October 1889"
