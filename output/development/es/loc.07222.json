We have been friends now 30 years. He will stay till middle of next week. Weather keeps pleasant—we have had plenty of rain & the trees & grass are very green. Mrs Bucke still away and the house quiet—not to say dull. We have whist in the evening often and we all enjoy it—No news.Love to youRM BuckeSee notes Aug 13, 1888 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 11 August 1888"
