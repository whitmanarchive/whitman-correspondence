    "text": "Superintendent's OfficeAsylum for the InsaneOntarioLondon, Ont.,5 Jan 1890It is 4 P.M. I am writing in my office. I can just see to write without the gas and that is all. It is warm and has rained all day (raining hard now). This is the funniest winter yet. La Grippe is having a lively time here. Knocking the folk over right and left (but they soon get up again). Nearly every one at my house is more or less sickâ€”some of them pretty bad (but nothing dangerous so far). Two of the Drs at the Asylum are doubled up in bed. Beemer & I keep around yet. Quite a number of attendants &c (no patients, so far) sick. If the disease increases it may cripple us pretty badly for a short time. Willy Gurd has been very sick for 3 days, a little better todayR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 5 January 1890"
