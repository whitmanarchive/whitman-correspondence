    "text": "BostonSaturday Evn'gEvening Aug:August 27Dear Sister LouAll goes satisfactory here—I keep as well as usual—have a very good room & board in a kind of half hotel half boarding house, the hotel Waterston—the landlady Mrs Moffit, has a hundred guests when full, mostly families, very nice—capital table, (most too good for me, tempts me too much)—My book is getting on swimmingly—I have got it (after considerable worrying & doing & undoing) into a shape that suits me first-rate, and this printing office is putting it into typographical shape too that satisfies me well—nearly 100 pages already set up & cast—so you see that's working all right—I am mostly here at the printing office, five or six hours every day, reading proof & seeing to things—Mr Osgood the publisher & Rand & Avery the printers are very friendly indeed, I couldn't have better ones to deal with. I suppose you get the papers I send—the Boston Globe of four or five days ago—& others—I get my letters very well here, sent on from Camden—Lou I send a small package directed to you by mail, please put it up on my table—Shall send occasionally same way, to be put up there & kept for me—I go out riding now & then, am to go for a couple of hours this evening—havn'thaven't got anything from you since (I believe) Monday last.—Address me either here (see outside of this envelope)—or care Osgood & Co: 211 Tremont Street—Of course the greatest anxiety about the President—thought here to-day there is no hope—it is terrible—Brother Walt Walt Whitman to Louisa Orr Whitman, 27 August [1881]"
