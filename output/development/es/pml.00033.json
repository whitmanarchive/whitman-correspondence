    "text": "Department of JusticeWashingtonDec 27 1871.Dearest mother,There is nothing special to write about to-day. The new Attorney General Mr. Williams has been in once or twice—he is a tallish, western sort of man, wears a stove-pipe hat—is rather spare & a little round shouldered—sallow complexion—long legged—seems quite plain in his talk—Ashton says he is a good man—we will see—He takes his seat about the 10th Jan. ½ past 10, forenoon—Mama, your letter has just come—It is too bad to have such a puppy as Stanton annoying you—He is one of the Heyde sort, it always seemed to me—Mother, write to me how it turns out—whether they leave or not—I see you have it very changeable there too—After the severest cold spell ever known here so early, we are just now having it mild & warm enough for spring—it rained here this morning, but is now bright & pleasant—I suppose Lou will be with you now—I should like first rate to just drop in on you all—I continue to get letters &c from abroad about my book—I believe I told you I got one the other day from Denmark, from the editor of the principal magazine there. He is preparing a review & partial translation of my writings—Mama dear, I hope you will have a pleasant holiday week, what's left of it—Don't let Stanton annoy you, the dirty scamp—Love to you, dearest mother, & to George & Lou & all. Walt.Write by next Sunday if convenient, & tell me if the order comes safe—Mother, give the enclosed $1 to the letter-carrier, if you think proper— Walt Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 27 December 1871"
