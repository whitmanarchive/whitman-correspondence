    "text": "1872BrooklynJune 18. Dear Pete,I am having a better time here than I had my last visit.—The weather is very pleasant—pretty hot during the middle of the day, but mornings & nights perfect—No moonlight walks out beyond Uniontown here—but I go on the river, & cross to & fro in the pilot house. Last night was beautiful—Saturday I spent at Coney Island—went in swimming—Mother is only middling—has some pretty bad spells with rheumatism—will break up here, & go with my brother George, to Camden, N. J. in September. I suppose you got a letter from me last Saturday, as I wrote you the day before. Pete, dear son, if you should want any of your money, send me word. It is either $120 (or $130, I am not sure—but I have a memorandum in my desk at Washington)—I am feeling real well, & hope you are too, my loving boy. Walt. Walt Whitman to Peter Doyle, 18 June [1872]"
