    "text": "July 1890Your good, long, varied and loving letter came yesterday and has been welcome and nourishing me. Sure I read about that Australian \"interior\" bit, and \"shearing,\" and about the experience and death of Gordon, the poet—and the whole letter, with much I will not particularize—with deepest interest, and thank you for sending it to me and hope for more; and can almost see you all there, and would wish to specifically send remembrance and love to you, Fred Woods, Jim Hartigan, Ada, Eve, Mr and Mrs Fryer, Ted, Louie, \"Tom Touchstone\" (when there) and any other friends not named. The cute and loving appreciation of my book and me by them in Australia has gone right to my heart—is far more than literary or technical fame.Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to Bernard O'Dowd, July 12, 1890"
