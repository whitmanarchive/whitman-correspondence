    "text": "Sunday Afternoon May 12. Dear friend,My brother does not get on quite as well as I had anticipated. Yet I still hold to the judgment in my previous letter. He has been, & is, very sickâ€”has had improved spells, & then goes down again. To-day he is in the latter condition.William, I received the letter, with Ramsdells note. Also Allen's. (Also the first letter soon after my arrival here.)As to Allen, refusing &c. giving his views, reasons, &c. &c. it is perhaps one of those services to a thing, (precious, rare & precious, in philosophy, & life too,) rendered by showing not only how that thing appears from the point of view of intensest vermin & filth, exclusively, but of vermin & filth diluted with shallowness to the last degree that life will bear. If my brother does not get worse, & no crisis takes place, I think, (as at present intending) I shall leave for Washington Wednesday morning next. Mother is well, (considering). All the rest are first rate. Jeff is in St. Louis. Nelly, I send you my true love, my darling. Walt. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 12 May [1867]"
