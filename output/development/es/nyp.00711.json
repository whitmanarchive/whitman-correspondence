Nicely I hope.—H T is going over his L S books & more & more impress'd with the sketches—I have had a bad winter & have yet—grip, catarrh of bowels, bladder trouble &c: &c:—have not been outdoors for ten weeks—but sit up here & read & write much of the time—but fearful inertia & loss of interest, grip, or zest—Have a good doctor & take medicine daily—Am printing the little 2d annex, \"Good-Bye my Fancy\"—reading the proofs & putting it through slowly—Should not get along with it or anything without Horace Traubel—comes every day, & is invaluable—Dr B is still the same in London Canada—I believe expects to come this way (& to Washington) in three weeks—Fine sunny day as I write—had my breakfast a rare fried egg, Graham wet toast & coffee—my supper at 5—no dinner—pretty fair spirits—often think of you there & the former times—Write when you can.God bless youWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 8 April 1891"
