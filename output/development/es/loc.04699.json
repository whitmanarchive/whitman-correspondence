    "text": "Anderton, n Chorley.Lancashire, England17 Feb 1891My dear Walt Whitman,I have only time at present for a few lines to say that we received a cable message from Traubel this morning, with the welcome intelligence that you were \"all right\" &c. Whatever deductions may require to be made from this, it is still glad news to us & we hopethat further & detailed information will shew[show] some improvement on your late condition.Yesterday I received from a friend in Leeds a copy of an English edition of Ingersoll's lecture which I will send on to you with this in case you have not seen it. I intend to order a few copies of it in addition to the American copies ordered through TraubelI was detained in Bolton tonight on business, & afterwards called on Dr J. before coming on here by the last train. He asked me to convey his love to you, & with filial love & best wishesI remainYours affectionatelyJ.W. Wallace James W. Wallace to Walt Whitman, 17 February 1891"
