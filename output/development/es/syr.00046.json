    "text": "[London, Ont.,]28 March [188]9Your card of 26th to hand this morning. I grieve much that you should be depressed and by me about O'C. but I am anxious that his possible death at any time should not take you unawares for if it did I fear it [would] be a terrible shock to you. [—] Weather here bright and colder, very pleasant—We keep all well—nothing new with us. [—] I have had quite a time the last few days arranging and posting recent additions to my W. W. Collection. It is growing rapidly and assuming very considerable proportions. Nothing new about the meter Willy Gurd still here—he is waiting for Nesbit (our other partner) who should have been here to consult long ago but does not come for some reasonBest regardsR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 28 March [188]9"
