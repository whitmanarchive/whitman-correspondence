Notwithstanding the disclaimer in yours of April 28 I also send a set for Richard Bentley in response to his kindness & generosity: (if any thing I know not of prevents its reaching him, I wish you to keep it for yourself.) Please see that the photograph is given to the School of Art, with my affectionate respects. Trusting to your kindness to see that they are carefully sent to the subscribers. Walt Whitman to Robert Buchanan, 4 September 1876"
