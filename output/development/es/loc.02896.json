    "text": "Belmont, MassJune 17, 1886.My Dear Whitman,—Don't you thik[think] it would be well for you to give me a line to Prof. Dowden, telling him that you have read the bibliography of my forthcoming book, and that you think you can commend the work to his careful reading. Also a word of introduction to Symonds, in case he will be willing to write an Introduction to it, (the book). I am afraid they will be but dilatory in taking hold of the matter on my request alone,. But a word of introduction from you, worded as you please, would secure their devoted service. There is not a word of criticism in the book; it is solely an enthusiastic eulogy and an interpetationinterpretation and defencedefense of your whole life, aims, and work,—accompanied by a valuable bibliog.bibliography and concordance, with an appendix, and three illustrations. My belief is that it will have a great sale in Great Britain, if it is got before your public there in the right way. For my part, I dislike to ask anyone for to serve as go-between, but you seemed to think it would be wise. Be sure and tell me always how you are. I am just finishing the chapter \"Walt W. & his Friends\". My roses are superb; have pitched a tent in my yard. Aff.AffectionatelyW. S. Kennedy. Could you answer at once, sending me the letters of introduction?Kennedy William Sloane Kennedy to Walt Whitman, 17 June 1886"
