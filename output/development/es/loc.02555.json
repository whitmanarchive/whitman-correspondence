Tell them I remember them all so well & so pleasantly——I have been down in the country at a secluded primitive farm all summer, living much of the time outdoors by a solitary woody pond, (half the time naked or half-naked)—am now quite fat & all tanned & red—Love to you, my friend—Walt WWhere & how is Waters? Where is the picture? Walt Whitman to John H. Johnston, 25 September [1877]"
