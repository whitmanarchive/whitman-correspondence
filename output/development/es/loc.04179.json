    "text": "AM HOF,DAVOS PLATZ,SWITZERLAND.Nov: 28 1884Dear Mr. Whitman One of your always welcome & ever venerated tokens has reached me here tonight (closely following a predecessor); in the shape of \"The Critic\" for Nov 8, containing lines by you, which show that the old Master has not lost his own inimitable cunning. I also hear from a dear friend of mine Edward Clifford that he has been seeing you, & (what is very valuable news) that he has made a drawing of you. This I shall get a sight of, doubtless, soon after his return to England—in photograph at least. Now I want to tell you why it is I have never lately sent you tokens in the shape of work by me. It is not from want of love for you, not because I am not always in communion with you:—that I am, & so are all my friends; there is a fine young fellow, son of Col Brackenbury, lying dead now in my neighbor's house, whose mother brought me back to day a copy of Leaves of Grass wh.which I had lent him last March & wh.which had been his constant companion ever since. No: it is not that I do not love you, & do not dwell with you, that I have sent no token of my work. One reason is that I judge my work unworthy of you in the first place, & in the second place so contrary to your canons of literary production that I can hardly imagine you can care for it. Now, however, I hurl from 3 several publishers three little books at your devoted (most sacred) head:—just to show you that the chord of sympathy wh.which finds me as disciple in soul to you is still glowing; even though the conditions in wh.which I have been developed, prevent me from following your precepts further than in the resolute endeavor to be sincere & thorough. You will see that I have stamped my two books of Sonnets with the heraldic coat borne by my ancestors for the last five hundred years. The 3 trefoils signify for me \"The Whole, the Good, the Beautiful,\" as is shown by the motto from Goethe. You may not object to the \"feudalism\" of these arms, if I tell you that our patriot John Hampden bore them by right of his wife (my Maternal ancestress), & that Samuel Symonds brought them to America in 1639 or thereabouts as Depty GovrDeputy Governor. of New England under Winthrop. He gave the names to Ipswich & Toppesfield (ancestral places of England) in that state. I have made this discourse to conquer any prejudice wh.which you might feel against books stamped with so effete & obsolete a gimcrack as a coat of arms! One Sonnet on p: 145 of \"Vagabunduli Libellus\" explains the meaning of that coat for me. In sections \"Among the Mountains\" & \"Envoy to a Book\", you will find many Sonnet-references to my life up here, 5200 feet above sea-level. It is not a bad life. I have wife & children around me, home of my own, nearly all the peasants for familiar friends (especially young fellows, drivers, teamsters, post officials, farmers), & have besides a heap of books & plenty of literary work to do—this last, however, not remunerative. I suffer from a chronic disease of the lungs, the result of breaking an artery seven years ago while riding a stubborn horse in England. But I find that much exercise in the open air & regular habits give me a fair amount of physical vigour yet; enough to enjoy the society of simple folk & to carry on the sort of work I have selected. I will send you photos of my house, myself (done by Clifford), & 3 of my daughters. I am sincerely glad to hear that you are still tolerably hearty & around among your friends. Believe me most sincerely yours John Addington Symonds— I always feel Calamus more deeply than any part of your work; & the reason why I have not published much that I have written about your poems, is that I cannot get quite to the bottom of Calamus. I wish I had your light upon it! from J. A. Symonds | Davos Platz | Switzerland | Nov. ’84. John Addington Symonds to Walt Whitman, 28 November 1884"
