    "text": "Attorney General's Office, Washington. Monday, Sept. 14, 1868Dear Abby,I shall come on in the train that leaves here in the middle of the day, to-morrow Tuesday, 15th, & gets in New York at 10 at night—so I shall be up there by or before 11 to-morrow night—(to-night for you reading this.) I am really pleased that you can accommodate me, & make great reckoning of being with you, & of my room, &c—but wish [to] have it distinctly understood, in all friendship, that I pay for my room, &c, just the same as any body else—positively I will not come on any other terms—& you must just let it be as I say this time—I have lots of money—in fact untold wealth—& I shall not feel right if you undertake to alter this part of my programme—I am feeling well & hearty—I wish you to read my piece in the \"Broadway London Magazine,\" just out—it was written for you among the rest—In a few hours I shall be with you. Walt. Walt Whitman to Abby H. Price, 14 September 1868"
