    "text": "New York, October 4, 1868. Dear friend,I suppose you received my letter of September 25. The letters to me from A. G. office, (I suppose sent by you,) have probably all come right. I have received some five or six. Please continue to send them the same way. If the envelopes run out, please prepare some more, same form. When you write, tell me what news in the A. G. office. Is Ashton well? Is he running the office? Say to him I sent my love—& that, here north, as it seems to me, the Grant & Colfax tide is rising higher & higher every day. Did you see John Swinton's warm ¶ about my illustrious self in N. Y. Times, 1st instant? Give my best love to John Burroughs, & show him this note to read. J. B., dear friend, I wish I could have you here, if only just to take a ride with me for once up & down Broadway, on top a stage, of a fine afternoon. I send my love to Charles Eldridge—By a wretched oversight on my part I missed an appointment with him at Fifth Av. Hotel, when he passed through New York. William, I shall send Freiligrath a small package, containing a copy of L. of G. with John's Notes, a Good Gray Poet &c. in a couple of days from here, by the European Express. I wish, if you feel like it, you would prepare a letter to F. F. to go by mail—following the package. Nelly, my dear friend, I send you my best love—in which my mother joins me—We are all well. Half my leave has already expired—& the other half will be soon over. AffectionatelyWalt. Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 4 October 1868"
