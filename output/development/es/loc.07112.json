    "text": "InsaneAsylum LondonOntario18 Sept. '90A lovely bright cool Autumn day. Am working away here in my office at the Asylum as usual. Have from you this morning \"Poet Lore\" and photo. of Galveston, Wallace and others—thanks.Nothing stirring here but the usual work—am hard at my Annual Report while all other Asylum matters must be attended to at the same time—then Ispend about an hour a day on the meter. All these things keep me going pretty well. A few weeks will see me in calmer water I hope. The meter goes well but not to say rapidly—it will be a couple of weeks yet I guess before we get fairly started making (this \"start\" is always a couple of weeks ahead—but we will catch up to it yet!)—We are getting a lot of new books for the Asylum library and among them are a set of Little, Brown & Co's Dumas Works—I am reading (evenings) the Count of Monte Cristo—it is many years since I read it first (more than forty, I guess)—This L.B. ed. is a good translation and it is a grand story (and I must say there is nothing I like much better than a real good story of the old fashion kind—Marryatt, Scott, or Dumas—these modern \"PsychologicalAnalisis[Analysis]\" folk such as George Eliot, Wilkie Collins, Tolstoi, Turgenieff[Turgenev] & co. though splendid in their own way don't go to the right spot after all in the same direct straightforward manner).I am anxiously waiting to hear more about Ingersoll Lecture for the benefit of W.W.Best love to youRM Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 18 September 1890"
