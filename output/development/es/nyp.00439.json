    "text": "431 Stevens StreetCamden N Jnoon May 7 '82Dear William O'ConnorYours of 5th rec'dreceived & welcomed. To keep you posted I make notes at random of this Osgood affair, & send herewith. I have an article A Memorandum at a Venture 5 or 6 pages signed by my name in the forthcoming June number North American Review, which, although hastily written & eligible to great additions, I consider a sort of rallying point or key note to my position in the Children of Adam business—will be out probably 12th to 15th of May—I shall have some proof copies, & will send you two or three soon as I get them—(It is a paid for contribution, my own price given)—the newspapers specially like to have something up at the moment—this N ANorth AmericanRev.Review piece might give a current reason-why for your article—commencing by alluding to it—The skeleton-facts of the Osgood publication are these. Osgood & Co. wrote to me last May ('81) asking about a new & complete edition & suggesting that they were open to proposals. I wrote back that a new & complete edition was contemplated but I wanted it distinctly understood that not a line was intended to be left out or expurgated—that the book must be printed in its entirety & that those were prerequisites opening to any negotiation. They wrote back asking me to send the copy. I sent it. In a few days they wrote me that they would publish it. The bargain was closed. I was to have 12½ per cent on the sales, and the contract was to run ten years. I went on to Boston (Sept. '81) and saw the book through the press—pub last of Nov. '81—(I think [some?] 3000 must have been published by them since then.)In their penultimate letter (a month or so ago) Osgood & Co: wrote me that the pieces the District Attorney specially & absolutely required to be entirely expurgated were To a Common Prostitute and A Woman Waits for Me—those left out the rest could be arranged without trouble, & he would allow the publication to continue—but the leaving out of those two pieces was indispensable.I shall write you again, dear friend, as any thing occurs or suggests itself that I think you ought to know bearing on this matter—I am well as usual now—after a pretty bad month of illness—but mainly getting along pretty well & in good spirits considering—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 7 May 1882"
