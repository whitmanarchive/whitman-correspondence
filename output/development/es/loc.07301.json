    "text": "Superintendent's Office.Asylumfor the InsaneLondon.OntarioLondon, Ont.,13 May 1889So our old dear friend O'Connor is gone at last. Thank God that he died peacefully, without pain. My great regret is that with his magnificent abilities he should have done so comparatively little to keep his name alive. However he will be long remembered—if for nothing else—for the \"Good Gray Poet\" which will not be forgotten for a while yet. His death will be a great grief and also a great relief to Mrs O'C. The care of him was almost more than she could bear. She will of course grieve bitterly but for her sake I am glad his life was not prolonged if it had been she must have broken down and that would have made things worse than ever. I believe, dear Walt, that it is all right and as it should be—and I trust when I come to die myself, as I must and ought in a little while, that I shall say the same thing. \"We shall go to him though he will not come back to us\" and when we do go to him we shall see that there things are better managed than they would be if we had our way with them.Mrs O'Reilly (wife of the Inspector of Asylums) died yesterday morning—I go to Toronto to the funeral tomorrow—back next day.So we go one after the other—but it is all right—what good would it be to stay?Your friendR M Bucke Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 13 May 1889"
