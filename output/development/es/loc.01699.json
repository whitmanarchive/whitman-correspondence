    "text": "Department of JusticeWashingtonsent Sept. 17, 1871I send herewith the copy of my American Institute Poem. It will be plain sailing, if you have a careful printer & proof reader. I think an ordinary 12 mo would be best, and send you a sample, my idea of size of page, and sort of pamphlet-volume to be made. As to size of type for the poem, if English solid would not be too large, I would like to have that. If you think it too large, take the next smaller size. In binding let the edges remain uncut, & bind in the kind of paper according to sample. See sample of title on cover. Send the revised proofs to me by mail, directed to this city, and I will promptly return them. My percentage &c. I leave to you to fixâ€”I should expect two or three dozen copies. I reserve the copyright to myself. That the papers have freely printed & criticized the piece will much help, as it awakes interest & curiosity, & many will want to have it in good form to keep. The demand will grow. I have no authority to speak for them, but I think the American Institute will want several hundred copies, & that the pamphlet will have a sale at all their public Exhibitions & Fairs. They always have book stands at them. It ought to be put in hand immediately, & out soon. Walt Whitman to Roberts Brothers, 17 September 1871"
