I am much as usual, but cannot move around at all—Keep good spirits however & am living comfortably enough—Of course lonesomeness & bodily disability are dreadful, but things might be so much worse—Many cases of extreme suffering, poverty, sickness, old age &c. around here lately—As I write I am sitting by the open window in the little front sitting room down stairs—Every thing is very quiet—the expressman is just taking over a big clay head to Phila: to be cast—modeled here by a sculptor—Best loveWalt Whitman Walt Whitman to Hannah Heyde, 17 August 1887"
