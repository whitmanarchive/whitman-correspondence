I rec'd Nelly's two brief cards over two weeks ago—but hunger for more frequent & fuller information—Hear from Dr B[ucke] & Kennedy often & from John B[urroughs] at long intervals—K's book has not yet begun the printing but is to be—is settled. All my Herald bits will be included in November Boughs & I will send an early proof of all to you—As I write I am sitting here in my big chair by the window (I have open'd it a few moments—it is near sunset—air a little tart)—I am quite immobile & don't get out except by being toted—a bunch of white lilies is in the window & my bird is singing like a house afire—Walt Whitman Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 12 April 1888"
