    "text": "Superintendent's Office.ASYLUM FOR THE INSANELONDON. ONTARIOLondon, Ont.,4 Sept 1888Dear FriendI have yours of 2d I do not consider that you owe me anything (the balance is the other way). As for Nettie I should like to have here and keep her for your sake as long as she lives but it is terribly bad business to send horses here. A horse worth $200. in Camden would only be worth $125 to $150. here, and there would be freight and a heavy duty to pay. I think you ought to have Harned or Traubel see to selling the horse & wagon there and use the money to hire an easy carriage whenever you are able to get out for a drive. The phaeton is not suitable for you now—not easy or solid enough. If you feel that you want to give me any thing (you owe me nothing), let it be in the form of books—autographed—\"Centenial Ed.\" or \"Complete Works\" as you like, these I should look upon as being equal to greenbacks for solid value. The weather here keeps perfect—I am rejoiced that you are feeling some easier—you have a wonderful constitution and you may (I think will) make a good rally when the pleasant cool autumn days come.Best love to youRM BuckeSept 4 Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman, 4 September 1888"
