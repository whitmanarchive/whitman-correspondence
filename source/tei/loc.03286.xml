                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener> 

            <p> I got your letter when I was in Washington and fully expected to stay over and see
                you on my return,<ptr target="loc.03286_n1"/> but I was kept so much longer than I
                thought I would be kept and so much more work was thrown on me that I was compelled
                to hurry back to New York by night. It is possible that I may be in Philadelphia
                this week&#8212;indeed it is probable&#8212;and in that case I shall certainly cross
                the ferry; but in the meantime why should you be idle? I shall not presume to give
                you any hints as to how to write; I think you know what I want:&#8212;</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="underline">1st. Lincoln</hi>: Mr. Rice<ptr target="loc.02206_n4"/> has got
                the ambition of editing a work that <hi rend="underline">can</hi> never be <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03286.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03286.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> superseded.<ptr
                    target="loc.03286_n2"/> He proposes to get every man of note now living who ever
                met Lincoln to write down in plain words and as accurately as the human memory will
                record, just what Lincoln did; just how Lincoln looked; just what impression Lincoln
                made on him. However, he does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> want the last clause
                (that is to say, the impressions) recorded by anybody but only by men whose names
                will go down to history. Like Gradgrind,<ptr target="loc.03286_n3"/> "what he
                wants is <hi rend="underline">facts</hi>." </p>
            <p> You, of course, are among the favored few whose impressions will be acceptable; so,
                you see, if you will write down an account of every interview you ever had with
                Lincoln, <hi rend="underline">that</hi> will complete what I ask of you in his name on that subject. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="underline">2d Memoires of the War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> He would like from you an account of some phase of the Civil War which you
                witnessed. But I will see you before you have time, <hi rend="underline"
                    >probably</hi>, to write the second article, and, <hi rend="underline"
                    >possible</hi>, I may be able to suggest the best topic from his point <pb

                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03286.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> of view to begin
                with. </p>
            <p> Now, my dear Walt Whitman, won't you go to work at once because Rice is chained
                lightning in a dress suit and damned impatient. </p>
