                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your two Bolton friends and admirers, J. Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> &#38; J. W.
                Wallace,<ptr target="n6121"/> again write in sending you their love and best wishes on your Birthday.</p>
            <p>We are very thankful to have within our power the means of again communicating with
                you and of sending you a small token of our deep and continued reverence &#38;
                affection.</p>
            <p>Since our last letter your <hi rend="underline">November Boughs</hi><ptr target="n3999"/> has <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01024.jpg" type="verso"/>appeared&#8212;of which
                we each immediately procured a copy. And not the least of the pleasures it gave us
                was the admirable portrait of yourself on the frontispiece. Every line of the book
                has been carefully read&#8212;most of it again &#38; again&#8212;&#38; has increased the
                heavy debt we owe you. We feel, too, in reading its closing lines that besides your
                other great services to humanity, <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, too, like Elias
                Hicks,<ptr target="n4265"/> like George Fox,<ptr target="n4326"/> have "laboured", and "made
                contributions" to, and, "best of all set an incarnated example" of, life spent in
                the constant "thought of God, merged in the thoughts of<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.01025.jpg" type="recto"/> moral right and the immortality of
                identity."&#8212;But <hi rend="underline">your</hi> contributions have been far
                greater, and of immeasurably wider scope than theirs, inasmuch as they go along with
                a vastly increased intellectual power and range, and are "consistent with the
                Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science." By these immense services in
                these our times, and especially in your contributions to the "thought of the
                immortality of identity," you have enrolled yourself for ever amongst those who, you
                justly say, are "<hi rend="underline">dearest</hi> to humanity,"&#8212;and are
                inexpressibly dear to <hi rend="underline">us</hi>.</p>
            <p>We hope that the remainder of your life may<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01026.jpg" type="verso"/> be serene and calm, and cheered by the
                ardent love and gratitude of those who, like <hi rend="underline">us</hi>, are so
                deeply indebted to you.</p>
            <p>We each send you <hi rend="underline">&#163;5</hi> which we should like you to expend
                in some visible token of our good will.</p>
            <p>We also enclose <hi rend="underline">2 photos</hi>. <hi rend="underline">1<hi
