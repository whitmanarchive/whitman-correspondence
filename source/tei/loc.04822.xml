                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am sorry that circumstances have prevented my writing to you as I intended since my
                return home.<ptr target="loc.04822_n3"/> But I have had very little leisure. Since Wednesday morning I have been
                living at Leigh—some 7 or 8 mile from Bolton—superintending some work
                which for a few days requires constant &amp; careful supervision. And I have little
                convenient opportunity for writing.</p>
            <p>I had a letter from D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J.<ptr target="n4102"/> this morning in which he tells me
                that he sent you a long account of our spree last Monday evening.<ptr target="loc.04822_n4"/> I need not go over
                the same ground.<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01928_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                You will understand what a pleasure it was to me to meet old friends again, so warm
                hearted &amp; loyal as they are. The Scotch proverb says truly that "there are nae
                freen's like auld freens,"<ptr target="loc.04822_n5"/> for old associations &amp; memories colour one's feelings
                very much.</p> 
            <p>Their welcome to me was very touching &amp; kind—&amp; like Coleridge's<ptr target="n3049"/> soup far "better than I deserved."<ptr target="loc.04822_n6"/>—I read them some of my
                notes of your talk, which, (the notes) though very poor &amp; inadequate, were of course extremely
                interesting to them. And they fully appreciated not only your kind messages, but
                also your kindness to me which<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01929_large.jpg" type="recto"/> they felt to be a compliment to the whole College.</p>
            <p>I distributed the photos you sent to each person present &amp; the books which you
                kindly inscribed. They were very much gratified &amp; pleased, &amp; evidently felt
                your kindness very much. Altogether we had not only a pleasant &amp; happy meeting,
                but a very memorable one too.</p>
            <p>Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> was at our house on Sunday, &amp; I gave him
                his books &amp;c then. He seemed quite overcome when I gave him the "Good-Bye"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> with your kind inscription "from his friend the author."
                He could only say "this is <hi rend="underline">too</hi> much!" &amp; look at it
                long &amp; long. He had two or<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01930_large.jpg" type="verso"/> three unmounted photos of himself &amp; family with him. I asked
                him to send one to you, &amp; he said he would do so.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday evening I called at Dearden's &amp; gave them <hi rend="underline">their</hi> copy of "Good Bye" with your inscription. They are good simple
                hearted souls &amp; were very much pleased.—I was glad to find Henry
                Dearden<ptr target="loc.04822_n8"/> looking much the same as when I left. He never
                knows day nor night of immunity from more or less of pain, but <hi rend="underline">is</hi> patient uncomplaining &amp; kind always. His wife<ptr target="loc.04822_n9"/> often reads to him
                &amp; at once said she would read "Good Bye" for him. Much of it, I know, will touch
                him deeply.<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01931_large.jpg" type="recto"/> I
                called at Greenhalgh's<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> &amp; Dixon's<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> &amp; gave them the little presents I had
                bought—In each case my chief pleasure was in seeing the delight of the
                children. One of the first questions that Dixon's eldest little girl<ptr target="loc.04822_n7"/> asked me was
                "how Walt Whitman was?</p>
            <p>I have had no opportunity yet of visiting the others.—But I expect to do so in a few
                days when I have finished here.</p>
            <p>The weather here is typical English November weather, dull, showery, with a good deal
                of moisture in the air. But yesterday<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01932_large.jpg" type="verso"/> was a beautiful day—though of
                a different type to your clear skies &amp; drier air.—And so far we have had
                little of the <hi rend="underline">fog</hi> we often get this month.</p>
            <p>I think I got a little cold in coming over (though nothing to speak of). I felt stiff
                &amp; tired for 2 or 3 days after arrival. But it has pretty nearly worn off &amp; I
                am feeling distinctly better for my trip. I hope with care to gain steadily for some
                time to come.</p>
            <p>I have received a business offer today, which, if accepted, would result in my coming
                to live permanently in Leigh. I am not very willing to do so, however,<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01933_large.jpg" type="recto"/> &amp; will
                consider it carefully before deciding.—</p>
            <p>I need not say that I think of you continually. Your solitude impressed me very
                deeply, &amp; as I think of your daily discomfort &amp; frequent pain, my heart goes
                out to you with aching sympathy.—But I remember, too, your serene cheerfulness
                &amp; acquiescence &amp; your constant kindness &amp; thought of &amp; for others. I
                doubt not that you are cheered &amp; sustained by the knowledge of the affection of
                friends, &amp; their readiness to do what they can, &amp; your faith in the
                perfection &amp; loving kindness of the scheme which provides for us all. May God
                bless you is my constant prayer.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01934_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
            <p>Please to give my affectionate regards to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis.<ptr target="n6113"/> I got to know her kind warmhearted nature
                pretty well. "I like most everybody M Wallace," she once said to me &amp; I thought
                it characteristic. I shall not soon forget her kindness to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>.</p>
            <p>And Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> too, please give my love to <hi rend="underline">him</hi>. I will write to them both soon.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Walt, once more good night &amp; God bless you. My deepest love to you
                always.</p>
