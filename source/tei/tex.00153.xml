            <p>I wrote you yesterday, (Monday,) which I suppose you rec'd, with the money. I have just heard from Han, &amp; I write to-day because I knew it would be a comfort to you to know right away. Heyde has just sent me a letter&#8212;he seems to be in a very good humor&#8212;writes a lot of stuff&#8212;but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> about domestic affairs this time&#8212;on "poetry" &amp; "criticism" &amp;c. &amp;c&#8212;of no interest at all to me&#8212;then at the close of the letter he says:</p>
            <p>"Han is much better than usual, &amp; is constantly promising to write to her mother."<ptr target="tex.00153_n1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mother, I send you the part of the N. Y. Times, containing a good long piece about me. It is the N. Y. Daily Times, of Sunday, Dec 2&#8212;but perhaps George or Jeff brought it to you last Sunday.</p>
            <p>I feel pretty well generally&#8212;with now &amp; then a poorish spell&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am going to hear the great actress Ristori<ptr target="tex.00153_n2"/> to-morrow night. One of my fellow clerks has taken a seat for me, &amp; made me a present of it&#8212;the play is "Queen Elisabeth"&#8212;I wish you &amp; Mat could go with me&#8212;</p>
            <p>The piece in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> is by O'Connor.<ptr target="tex.00153_n3"/> He grows stronger &amp; stronger, &amp; fiercer &amp; fiercer in his championship of "Leaves of Grass"&#8212;no one can ever say a word against it in his presence, without a storm. Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec 1&#8212;?</p>
            <p>William Swinton<ptr target="tex.00153_n4"/> is here in Washington, temporarily. He is interested in speculating in gold. It is very fine weather here to-day. I am writing this by my big window, where I can look out on the water&#8212;the sun is shining bright as silver.</p>
