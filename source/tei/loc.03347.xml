                <salute>My dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>    
            <p>I got your letter of the 6th, a postal card of the 11th,<ptr target="loc.03347_n2"/> divers newspapers, and day
                before yesterday the handsome magazine with the pen-an-ink portrait&#8212;a
                beautiful piece of work, but a bad likeness&#8212;in fact, a caricature, which I
                hope, as Voltaire<ptr target="n4296"/> said of the "Letter to Posterity," is a
                letter that will never reach its address. He has given you a wad for a mouth and
                made you squint like one of George Borrow's<ptr target="n4295"/> gipsies. Drat <pb

                imperence!</p>
            <p>I have had it on my mind for a month to write, but have had a bad time. I thought of
                you anxiously during the abominable swelter of August, and felt rejoiced when the
                cool spell came, hoping it would do you good, though I got a cold out of it, by ill
                luck, which pulled me back considerably.</p>
            <p>Your letter was very comforting. I shall hope to hear good news of you. I sent your
                messages to Dr. Channing,<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03347.005.jpg" type="recto"/> Grace<ptr target="n6143"/> and
                    Stedman.<ptr target="n1043"/> No news has reached me about the calendar, but I
                hope it is all right. Grace is expected here in a few days.</p>
            <p>Who is it writes of you so friendlily in the editorial notes of <hi rend="underline"
                    >Lippincott</hi>?</p>
            <p>I shall hope all good things for <hi rend="underline">November Boughs</hi>.<ptr target="loc.07454_n2"/> I wish it
                were further along.</p>
            <p>I have been using the spare hours when I have felt less weak and woe-begone than I
                usually do, and less weighted down with office work, to scratch <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03347.006.jpg" type="verso"/> off in pencil a
                defence of Donnelly's<ptr target="n4108"/> book for the N. A. Review, if I can only
                get it in. It has been a bad task, but a duty, for the reviewers have been
                outrageous.</p>
            <p>My hope and heart are high for you. If the weather will only let up!</p>
            <p>Good bye. I find that I can't write much, as I hoped to when I began. As the Indian
                said to Roger Williams<ptr target="n4297"/> when they landed at Seekonk, "What
                cheer, brother, what cheer!"&#8212;meaning, all cheer!<ptr target="loc.03347_n3"/></p>
