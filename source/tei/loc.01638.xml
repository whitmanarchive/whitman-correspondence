                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute> 
            </opener>

            <p>I am having another of my bad spells to-day—but it will pass over—I have had a pretty good 
                time most of the week till last night—thought I was getting decidedly better—(&amp; guess I am yet, &amp; that this will pass over.)</p>
           <p>Every thing goes on the same with me here. As I write this, I am sitting here alone as usual 
                in the parlor by the heater—I have just been out, but it was so chilly &amp; raw, I didn't 
                venture off the block, but came back in 5 or 6 minutes—the air feels like snow.</p>
            
            
            <p>The trains of the Camden &amp; Amboy are going by on the track about 50 or 60 rods from here, 
                puffing &amp; blowing—often train after train, following each other—&amp; locomotives singly, 
                whisking &amp; squealing, up the track &amp; then down again—I often sit here 
                &amp; watch them long—&amp; think of you.
            </p>
            
            <p>I think I shall try again to get out, evening—sometimes it makes me feel better, 
                after I get out in the open air, &amp; move around a little</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01638.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>7:15 evening—Friday—</p>
            
            <p>—I am writing this over in the Mercantile Library, 10th st. <choice><abbr>Phila.</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice>—I have felt better 
                since 4 o'clock &amp; have come out &amp; crossed the river, &amp; taken quite a ride up Market st. 
                2 miles in the Market st. cars. The cars are very nice, old style, cushioned, fare 7 cents—if you get a transfer you have to pay extra—the working hours are from 16½ to 18—they have the new alarm punch,—every fare or ticket,—rings a little bell every time you punch—I suppose you have seen it—they say it is quite a success, &amp; they are introducing them 
                in other cities—but it will get played out—</p>
            
            <p>—Pete write how you are getting along—&amp; all about the folks, every one I know—I am feeling as well as usual, as I finish this letter—Good bye for this time my loving son—</p>

                <p><choice><orig>Dont</orig><reg>Don't</reg></choice> you get discouraged at work—or on the road—I feel that we shall yet 
                    be together, &amp; have good times just being with each other, no matter how poor
