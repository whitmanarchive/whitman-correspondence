                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute> 
            </opener>

            <p>I am having another of my bad spells to-day&#8212;but it will pass over&#8212;I have had a pretty good 
                time most of the week till last night&#8212;thought I was getting decidedly better&#8212;(&amp; guess I am yet, &amp; that this will pass over.)</p>
           <p>Every thing goes on the same with me here. As I write this, I am sitting here alone as usual 
                in the parlor by the heater&#8212;I have just been out, but it was so chilly &amp; raw, I didn't 
                venture off the block, but came back in 5 or 6 minutes&#8212;the air feels like snow.</p>
            
            
            <p>The trains of the Camden &amp; Amboy are going by on the track about 50 or 60 rods from here, 
                puffing &amp; blowing&#8212;often train after train, following each other&#8212;&amp; locomotives singly, 
                whisking &amp; squealing, up the track &amp; then down again&#8212;I often sit here 
                &amp; watch them long&#8212;&amp; think of you.
            </p>
            
            <p>I think I shall try again to get out, evening&#8212;sometimes it makes me feel better, 
                after I get out in the open air, &amp; move around a little</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01638.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>7:15 evening&#8212;Friday&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;I am writing this over in the Mercantile Library, 10th st. <choice><abbr>Phila.</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice>&#8212;I have felt better 
                since 4 o'clock &amp; have come out &amp; crossed the river, &amp; taken quite a ride up Market st. 
                2 miles in the Market st. cars. The cars are very nice, old style, cushioned, fare 7 cents&#8212;if you get a transfer you have to pay extra&#8212;the working hours are from 16½ to 18&#8212;they have the new alarm punch,&#8212;every fare or ticket,&#8212;rings a little bell every time you punch&#8212;I suppose you have seen it&#8212;they say it is quite a success, &amp; they are introducing them 
                in other cities&#8212;but it will get played out&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete write how you are getting along&#8212;&amp; all about the folks, every one I know&#8212;I am feeling as well as usual, as I finish this letter&#8212;Good bye for this time my loving son&#8212;</p>
