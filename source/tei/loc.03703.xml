                <p>Whereas, America's greatest poet Walt. Whitman is now in our city and has invited
                    all his friends and those who wish to see him to call on him and shake his hand <choice>

                    </choice> anniversary of Lincoln's "death," and</p>
                <p>Whereas, we all recognize ourselves as included and if engagements did not
                    prevent would gladly go personally and honor ourselves by honoring the poet
                    and</p>
                <p>Whereas, in all ages the truly great poets and artists have ever been the
                   truest exponents of the spirit of their age, and</p>
                <p>Whereas, we recognize in Walt Whitman's poetry the truest and best expression of
                    the real and vital <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ss">destiny</unclear> of the toiling
                    mass of this age and to his greatness in this respect (as Emerson said)<ptr

                    years from now.</p>
                <p>Resolved that we of the United Labor Party of the Seventh Assembly District of
                    New York not being able personally to take the venerable poet by the hand as we
                    would desire on this anniversary send him not only our respectful greetings, but
                    would express for him <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03703.004_large.jpg"

                    reverence and love</p>
                <p>Resolved, that not only does Walt Whitman have our reverence because of his
                    tender association with the name of Lincoln, but also because of his human sympathy, and for
                    his undying poems singing the dignity of labor and the equality and brotherhood of man</p>
                <p>Resolved that a copy of these resolutions be sent to Mr. Whitman</p>
