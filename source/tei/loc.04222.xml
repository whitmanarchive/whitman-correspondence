                <salute>My dear Friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I send you just a few lines to thank you for your very great kindness 
                in sending me your Book, a kindness I shall never forget. I have not seen
                you in the flesh but yet I feel that I understand you, 
                &amp; be assured, it raises within me a psalm of thanksgiving
                to know that there is a man (yourself) whose thoughts, feelings,
                actions have from first to last been of the purest, noblest, best;
                whose life stands out in all the perfect <choice><sic>symetry</sic><corr>symmetry</corr></choice> and perfect 
                beauty of self-sacrifice.</p>
            <p>I feel in thorough sympathy with the aim you have ever kept
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00366_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                in view, to elevate humanity &amp; to bring all men together as brethren.
                Nature and Humanity must have a common centre and to raise
                the ideals of life to their highest, everything must be seen as sacred.
                This you have done &amp; in time an increasing influence will
                flow from your 
                life &amp; example that will bless the world.
                Strong in faith and hope that the soul is immortal your words 
                will be sure helpers &amp; friends to many in the valley of
                doubt, and bring consolation to the sorrowing.</p>
            <p>You say "Whoso touches my book, touches me,"<ptr target="loc.04222_n3"/> and with reverence I claim
                to take you by the hand, and call you brother, yea, though you
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00367_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                are also my Master. In imagination I have looked at you (as in reality
                I have often looked at the photos of you in the L of G.)
                and seen you smile, and realized the greatness and the goodness that lay within.
                I have seen, strength blended with wisdom &amp; a love for Humanity that
                broke down all barriers of creed, or colour or condition, and realized
                how well I loved you for it all.</p>
            <p>And now I see you broken, but unconquered, by the years and
                the circumstances of life; suffering from pain of body &amp; the
                weakness of the flesh, but in mind &amp; soul calm and serene and
                beautiful as a setting sun. I saw brother J.W. Wallace <ptr target="n6121"/>
                last night who told me 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00368_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                how ill you were. He is a good soul &amp; as I
                listened to his reminiscences I felt anew that the future ages will be
                helped and quickened by your life and thought to broader sympathy
                and deeper love for justice and Humanity.</p>
            <p>I do most fervently trust that the pain of body is somewhat
                less and I am comforted by knowing that you are surrounded by some
                friends out of the many who would deem service to you an honour, &amp;
                that their love is some recompense for the sufferings of a sick bed.</p>
