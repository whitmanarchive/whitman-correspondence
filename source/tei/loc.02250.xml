            <p>Now that "enthusiastic cherishing from the few, gradually growing less few"<ptr
                    target="loc.02250_n2"/> has come to mean cherishing thousands growing to tens of
                thousands, most likely, your correspondents are overwhelmingly numerous.</p>

            <p>This sense forbids my taking up the pen carelessly to intrude upon your
                attention.</p>

            <p>I. Mr. H.H. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> has kindly given me particulars enabling
                me to apply to you, a great privilege, for some of your works&#8212;indeed I would
                like to possess most of them &#38; these in their sacred unmutilated</p>

            <p>entirety. 'Leaves of Grass,' Authors' Edition (1876)&#8212;'Two Rivulets' (1876),
                'Specimen Days &#38; Collect,' are those mentioned to me by Mr. Gilchrist. Will you
                have the kindness to send me these works, informing me at the same time of their
                cost, the amount of which I will not delay in sending.</p>

            <p>II. A request in another direction: I must begin by a d&#233;tour. All men &#38;
                women of generous soul who read you in your writings feel a brother's, the Poet's
                hand extended to them.</p>

            <p>I came to grasp it; my humility to God, my esteem to you.</p>

            <p>Tho' unknown to you I shall make no attempt to establish my fitness to ask your aid
                in</p>

                must fall.</p>

            <p>I have already treated in choral &#38; orchestral setting three great heads of human
                absorption&#8212;the theological, the humanitarian &#38; the erotic&#8212;the first,
                upon Keble's<ptr target="loc.02250_n8"/> "Christmas Day" (Christian Year)&#8212;the second,
                upon George Eliot's<ptr target="n3044"/> "O May I Join the Choir Invisible"; the
                third, upon W. Morris'<ptr target="loc.02250_n9"/> lyrical piece in "The Hill of Venus". In
                the first,&#8212;I send you a copy of this work<ptr target="loc.02250_n3"/>&#8212;I
                have perforce of my religious perception, vested the subject, 'The Nativity' with
                human belongings, human throbs in the Christ as founder, as a man, is solemn
                fact&#8212;the super natural story of him, to me, is but a grand Myth, the grandest
                perhaps of all time.</p>

            <p>Of my "Song of Humanity" I endeavour to convey the spirituality in these

                pure &#38; noble moral nature, the relations of man to man would be radically, &#38;
                absolutely altered.</p>

            <p>Between woman &#38; man there would be gentle ministering to holy yearnings where now

                alas! the word ever conveyed a meaning.</p>

            <p>In this lyric the poet sings of life as it <hi rend="underline">was without</hi>
                Venus, &#38; without the bond of fraternity. Indeed, he tells of life as it <hi

            <p>And now I return to my request&#8212;merely, that you may indicate to me where &#38;
                how I might find a text for such a work as I have in mind&#8212;an Opera or a
                Dramatic Oratorio. For both purposes alike the literary expression should pass
                briefly on in lucid meaning, never involved.</p>
