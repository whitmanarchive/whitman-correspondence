                <salute>Honoured &amp; dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Now that "enthusiastic cherishing from the few, gradually growing less few"<ptr target="loc.02250_n2"/> has come to mean cherishing thousands growing to tens of
                thousands, most likely, your correspondents are overwhelmingly numerous.</p>
            <p>This sense forbids my taking up the pen carelessly to intrude upon your
                attention.</p>
            <p>
               I. Mr. H.H. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> has kindly given me particulars enabling
                me to apply to you, a great privilege, for some of your works—indeed I would
                like to possess most of them &amp; these in their sacred unmutilated<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02250.002.jpg" type="verso"/> entirety. 'Leaves of
                Grass,' Authors' Edition (1876)—'Two Rivulets' (1876),<ptr target="loc.02250_n7"/> 'Specimen Days &amp; Collect,'<ptr target="n4121"/> are
                those mentioned to me by Mr. Gilchrist. Will you have the kindness to send me these
                works, informing me at the same time of their cost, the amount of which I will not
                delay in sending.</p>
               <p>II. A request in another direction: I must begin by a détour. All men &amp;
                women of generous soul who read you in your writings feel a brother's, the Poet's
                hand extended to them.
            </p>
            <p>I came to grasp it; my humility to God, my esteem to you.</p>

            <p>Tho' unknown to you I shall make no attempt to establish my fitness to ask your aid
                    in<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02250.003.jpg" type="recto"/> a matter
                belonging to my work as a composer. Intention must befriend me or my chance must
                fall.</p> 

            <p>I have already treated in choral &amp; orchestral setting three great heads of human
                absorption—the theological, the humanitarian &amp; the erotic—the first,
                upon Keble's<ptr target="loc.02250_n8"/> "Christmas Day" (Christian Year)—the
                second, upon George Eliot's<ptr target="n3044"/> "O May I Join the Choir Invisible";
                the third, upon W. Morris'<ptr target="loc.02250_n9"/> lyrical piece in "The Hill of
                Venus." In the first, I send you a copy of this work, I have perforce of my religious
                perception, vested the subject, 'The Nativity' with human belongings, human
                throbs:—the Christ as founder, as a man, is solemn fact—the super
                natural story of him, to me, is but a grand Myth, the grandest perhaps of all
                time.</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02250.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Of my "Song of Humanity" I endeavour to convey the spirituality in these
                words—
            <q type="song">
                "A celebration of man's high destiny—
                truth above the Faiths, the Religion of moral goodness,
                Fraternal sonship, responsive and responsible—Hope illimitable, beautiful,
                    strong, unvanquishable
                "Through sorrow &amp; the inscrutable—the experience of Omnipotent order
                    &amp; love."
            </q> 
            </p>
            <p>To the third production "Hymn to Venus" to which I allude I have written as
                'Argument'—"That which annihilates man's capacity as a moral being, is the
                presumption of his <hi rend="underline">need</hi> of a regeneration that
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02250.005.jpg" type="recto"/> he may be acceptable to man or God.</p>
            <p>Were he, at his coming, hailed as a creative 'form, virtuous but capable of sin'<ptr target="loc.02250_n5"/>—had he the <hi rend="underline">responsibility</hi>, placed upon him of an <hi rend="underline">innate</hi>
                pure &amp; noble moral nature, the relations of man to man would be radically, &amp;
                absolutely altered.</p>
            <p>Between woman &amp; man there would be gentle ministering to holy yearnings where now
                is sullen unrest, physical &amp; mental misery; and worse<pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02250.006.jpg" type="verso"/> corruption the direst man can
                suffer—his fallen sister.'</p>
            <p>Man would find edification in what now is his shame—the human God—imaged
                form, which lasts not beyond this fair earth.</p>
            <p>The sculptor's highest inspiration could be no man's <hi rend="underline">lust</hi>:
                alas! the word ever conveyed a meaning.</p>
            <p>In this lyric the poet sings of life as it <hi rend="underline">was without</hi>
                Venus, &amp; without the bond of fraternity. Indeed, he tells of life as it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> with us today "'mid weary thoughts of man &amp;
                    God"<ptr target="loc.02250_n6"/> go we our daily round;<pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02250.007.jpg" type="recto"/> with <hi rend="underline">faiths</hi>
                for our salvation which have their base &amp; rising of other elements than those of
                the eternal laws of human love (which is the divine), &amp; that Christly religion,
                    <hi rend="underline">moral goodness</hi>, which alone gives proof to <hi rend="underline">see</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">feel</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">know</hi> an Almighty
                God—a Father of all benevolence, tho' peace &amp; joy, throes &amp; heaviness
                hold the present of the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">high</unclear> heart.</p>
            <p>Such, be it affirmed, was the composers' conception of the lot of man while
                contemplating the subject before him."</p>
            <p>I would next treat as a subject some<pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02250.008.jpg" type="verso"/> view of life &amp; incident of America's heroic
                Democracy—the 4 years war, or the war of Independence.</p>
            <p>And now I return to my request—merely, that you may indicate to me where &amp;
                how I might find a text for such a work as I have in mind—an Opera or a
                Dramatic Oratorio. For both purposes alike the literary expression should pass
                briefly on in lucid meaning, never involved.</p>
            <p>The verse interwoven in blank &amp; lyric structure.</p>
            <p>I should more than value your <choice>
                    <sic>meagrest</sic>
                    <corr>meagerest</corr>
                </choice> suggestion &amp; indeed, would not willingly put you to the trouble of
                more than this.</p>
