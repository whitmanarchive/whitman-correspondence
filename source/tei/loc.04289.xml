            <p>Doctor<ptr target="n0119"/> is at his desk sending you
                one of the messages you so much affect.
                There is hardly need for me to add anything. Still I wish to say how 
                much I have enjoyed all things here &#38; how much I regret to have to make
                my stay so short.<ptr target="loc.04289_n1"/> We were happy today to have the three notes
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00620_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                from you. They arrived one with another,&#8212;a sweet sheaf
                fm the Southward. Bless you for all the fields
                you have planted &#38; harvested for the world! What you say of
                Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> address<ptr target="loc.07846_n3"/> goes home. Doctor's copy
                of that address arrived today. On Saturday I wrote Ingersoll quite a
                note&#8212;the first since the lecture&#8212;and today I 
                got good word off to Baker<ptr target="loc.07859_n6"/>: a truly
                noble &#38; loving
                fellow whom you would be <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">drawn</unclear> to.
                I read Doctor my essay (<hi rend="underline">N.E. Mag.</hi><ptr target="loc.03078_n3"/>) Sunday night.
                He set me on my feet with certain improvements in phraseology, on the point of your
                Washington sickness. He thinks your &#38; my terminology when we get off
                on that field
                lamentable if not laughable. Bucke has a big sneer when he minds. All
                is well with us. I am in love with Ina
             <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00621_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                &#38; Pardee.<ptr target="loc.07233_n3"/> They have a more than Grecian loveliness of expression
                &#38; demeanor&#8212;a commingling of two streams, antique &#38; modern. 
                They are such hopes as lead out to America's
                biggest future. We expect to have a generous drive tomorrow if it
                is clear. The sky tonight is overclouded. The earth here is flat, but the
                heavens tumble their gorgeous
                hills without stint.
                Canada&#8212;this part of it&#8212;is the land of horizons. Doctor gave
                a talk to students today, &#38; this day I went with him to the
                dance&#8212; both times curiously instructed &#38; quieted.

                I<ptr target="loc.04289_n2"/> read Symonds'<ptr target="n0615"/> negative essay today.
                After the "master" of his letters,
                this is all <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">touchy</unclear> &#38; resc<gap reason="illegible" quantity="3" unit="chars"/>. He
                must come out of his dim dread to say his say before he dies. When critics will
                cease to be icebergs, authorship will get
                its dues&#8212;not before!
