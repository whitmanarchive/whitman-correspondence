            <p>Your two postals of Oct 15<hi rend="underline">th</hi> &amp; 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02525_n2"/> came by last mail &amp; I thank you
                cordially for your thoughtful kindness in sending them &amp; for your information
                about J.W.W.'s<ptr target="n6121"/> visits to you.<ptr target="loc.08222_n4"/></p>
            <p>A good letter from Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/>—for wh: I should be glad
                if you would kindly thank him for me—&amp; another from Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> furnish us with some of the interesting details which are so
                eagerly devoured. But, like Oliver Twist,<ptr target="loc.02525_n3"/> we long for more.<ptr target="loc.02525_n9"/> <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02525.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> Our appetites are as insatiable as
                that of the horse-leech which constantly cries—"give, give!"<ptr target="loc.02525_n8"/></p>
            <p>Happy Wallace! Lucky Wallace! What an experience &amp; what life-long memories will
                henceforth be his!</p>

                &amp; letters from J.W.W. &amp; H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> Thanks &amp; again thanks to you all for your

            <p>Glad indeed are we all to know that your health keeps (comparatively) <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02525.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> good for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> &amp; that you are able to receive Wallace for a short
                time every day. It joys us too to hear from you that he is "well &amp; hearty" &amp;
                "Enjoying everything."</p>
            <p>And you have had your old friend Andrew Rome<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> over to see
                you too! <hi rend="underline">That</hi> would do you good I know &amp; his presence
                    w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> revive many dear reminiscences of the olden days
                &amp; make you feel young again. You know he &amp; I are cousins by marriage, &amp;

            <p>I have sent your p.c. upon its round <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02525.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> among the Whitman "Church"
                members.<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/></p>
            <p>This has been a glorious day—bright &amp; sunny—tho cool from East
                wind—with an almost cloudless blue sky—a day to rejoice the heart of man
                &amp; make him feel glad he is alive</p>
            <p>I am just in from my professional round &amp; write this to the accompaniment of the
                rattle of lorries cabs &amp; trains the bumping of Railway wagons—for my house
                is next to the goods yard—&amp; the screaming of engines—the setting sun
                shining &amp; flushing the paved street &amp; glittering in gold on the upper
                corridors of the houses opposite.</p>

            <p>Last Sunday we had Ben Tillett<ptr target="loc.02525_n5"/> in Bolton. I could not go to hear
                him but I send you a newspaper report of his "sermon" in which, I am told he spoke
                of you as one of the world's "five talent men" &amp; dwell upon your hospital work,
                coupling your name with that of Florence Nightingale<ptr target="loc.02525_n6"/> &amp; others.</p>
            <p>It will interest you to know that I have undertaken by request to read a paper on you
                before the "Bolton Literary Society," a society consisting mainly of the (so called)
                upper class &amp; of wh: our F.R.C. Hutton<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> is
                President</p>

            <p>This week we have had the first touch of Winter's cold fingers &amp; the recent gales
                &amp; slight night frosts have almost cleared the woods &amp; hedgerows of
                foliage</p>
            <p>May the oncoming Winter treat you leniently my dear good hearted old friend</p>
            <p>Good night to you &amp; god bless you! My kindest regards to Warry Harry<ptr target="loc.07663_n4"/> &amp; good
