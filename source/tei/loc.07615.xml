            </opener>
            <p>I cannot tell you what joy your message has given me, both as proof of your
                improvement and your remembrance.<ptr target="n5002d"/> I had feared that you were too ill to look at
                flowers or to identify, even in thoughts, those who think of you. With what joyful
                smiling I thank God that you are better, as I wept<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_sf.00067_large.jpg" type="verso"/> from my heart, at hearing of your
                extremity.</p>
            <p>In Specimen Days<ptr target="n4121"/> I found that an ancestor of yours settled very early in Weymouth,
                    <hi rend="underline">this</hi> portion of which where I am now staying was my
                father's<ptr target="loc.07615_n3"/> native place. I suppose from what I gather, that Whitman's Pond<ptr target="loc.07615_n2"/> takes its
                name from a branch of your family-tree.</p>
            <p>I am hoping some day of late summer or early autumn to see you at Camden. If you
                should then be able to say a few words yourself<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_sf.00068_large.jpg" type="recto"/> and hear me talk a little, without
                exhaustion, the visit would be a satisfaction.</p>
            <p>During your illness I have often wished to tell you what I have said both in public
                and private:&#8212;what, in one sense, no other writer of any age, has, in his work,
                laid so far-reaching and sympathetic a grasp on the heart of the future as you
                have done. Hundreds of years hence yes, as long as books last, men will feel on
                reading the Sun-Down Poem<ptr target="loc.07615_n1"/> and others<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_sf.00069_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of like nature, that your very
                existence touches theirs: that your vital presence is with them: and, with what
                comforting confirmation of immortality, will these words meet them:&#8212;</p>
