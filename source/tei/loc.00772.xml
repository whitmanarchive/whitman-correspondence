               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I got a long letter from George, dated near Lancaster, Kentucky, May 15th<ptr target="loc.00772_n1"/>&#8212;he seems to be well &amp; in good spirits, says he gets some letters from me &amp; papers too&#8212;At the time he wrote, the 51st was doing provost duty at Lancaster, but would not probably remain so very long&#8212;seem to be moving toward southeast Kentucky&#8212;had a good camp, &amp; good times generally. LeGendre<ptr target="loc.00772_n2"/> is colonel&#8212;Gen. Ferrero<ptr target="loc.00772_n3"/> has left the service&#8212;Col. Potter<ptr target="loc.00772_n4"/> (now Brig. Gen.) is in Cincinnati&#8212;Capt. Sims<ptr target="loc.00772_n5"/> &amp;c are all well&#8212;George describes Kentucky as a very fine country&#8212;says the people are about half &amp; half, secesh &amp; union. This is the longest letter I have yet rec'd from George. Did he write you one about the same time? Mother, I have not rec'd any word from home in over a week&#8212;the last letter I had from Mr. Lane was about 12 days ago, sending me $10 for the soldiers, (5 from Mr. Kirkwood<ptr target="loc.00772_n6"/> &amp; 5 from Conklin Brush.)<ptr target="loc.00772_n7"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mother dear, I should like to hear from Martha, I wish Jeff would write me about it<ptr target="loc.00772_n8"/>&#8212;has Andrew gone? &amp; how is your wrist &amp; arm, mother&#8212;We have had some very hot weather here&#8212;I don't know what I should have done without the thin grey coat you sent&#8212;you don't know how good it does, &amp; looks too&#8212;I wore it three days, &amp; carried a fan &amp; an umbrella, (quite a Japanee)&#8212;most every body here carries an umbrella, on acc't of the sun&#8212;yesterday &amp; to-day however have been quite cool, east wind&#8212;Mother, the shirts were a real godsend, they do first rate, I like the fancy Marseilles collar &amp; wristbands&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, how are you getting along&#8212;I suppose just the same as ever&#8212;I suppose Jess &amp; Ed are just the same as ever&#8212;when you write, you tell me all about every thing, &amp; the Browns,<ptr target="loc.00772_n9"/> &amp; the neighborhood generally. Mother, is George's trunk home &amp; of no use, there? I wish I had it here, as I must have a trunk&#8212;but do not wish you to send it, until I send you word&#8212;I suppose my letter never appeared in the Eagle,<ptr target="loc.00772_n10"/> well I shall send them no more, as I think likely they hate to put in any thing which may celebrate me a little, even though it is just the thing they want for their paper &amp; readers. They altered the other letter on that account, very meanly. I shall probably have letters in the N. Y. Times &amp; perhaps other papers in about a week<ptr target="loc.00772_n11"/>&#8212;Mother, I have been pretty active in hospitals for the past two weeks, somewhere every day or night&#8212;I have written you so much about cases &amp;c I will not write you any more, on that subject this time&#8212;O the sad, sad things I see, the noble young men with legs &amp; arms taken off&#8212;the deaths&#8212;the sick weakness, sicker than death, that some endure, after amputations&#8212;(there is a great difference, some make little of it, others lie after it for days, just flickering alive, &amp; O so deathly weak &amp; sick)&#8212;I go this afternoon to Campbell Hospital, out a couple of miles.</p>
            <p>Mother, I should like to have Jeff send me 20 of the large sized portraits &amp; as many of the standing figure, do them up flat. I think every day about Martha. Mother, have you heard any further about Han? Good bye for the present, dearest mother.</p>
