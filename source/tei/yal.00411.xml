        <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good wood
        fire in the stove—have been alone all the evening—I sit up as much as I can,
        especially evenings—as I sleep better afterwards—I rec'd a letter from Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/>
        to–day,<ptr target="yal.00411_n1"/> Matty<ptr target="n0707"/> was as well as at last
        accounts—about the same—no worse—I also rec'd a letter from Heyde<ptr target="yal.00411_n2"/>—he said Han<ptr target="n0285"/> was well as
        usual—</p>

      <p>I have been sitting up nearly all day—&amp; have less distress in the head than I
        have had—which is a great gain—I had a letter from Mrs. Price<ptr target="n0483"/> to–day—she invites me to come &amp; stop awhile there, as soon as I can
        journey—</p>

      <p>Mother, it is kind of <hi rend="italic">company</hi> to write to you—it is very
        lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room—about 9 Charles Eldridge<ptr target="n0210"/> comes in &amp; assists me to soak my feet in hot water, &amp; then I turn
        in—(I have my <choice>
          <orig>trowsers</orig>
          <reg>trousers</reg>
        </choice> on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)—</p>

      <p>Friday noon <lb/>Feb. 14 </p>

      <p>Mother, I am sitting up again to–day—passed a comfortable night, &amp; as soon
        as it is favorable weather I shall try to get <hi rend="italic">started</hi> for
        outside—first, to get down stairs—&amp; then perhaps across the
        street—</p>

      <p>3 o'clock </p>

      <p>I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest—Mrs.
          O'Connor<ptr target="n0450"/> has just been to see me—brought a basket of nice
        things—</p>

      <p>Mother dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—I send you Harper's<ptr target="n0290"/> &amp; Frank Leslie's<ptr target="n0246"/>—I am having a very fair
        day to–day—it is moderate &amp; pleasant here, but mostly cloudy—I have
        been quite occupied writing several letters about business<ptr target="yal.00411_n3"/>—have set up all day, with the exception of an hour—Love to you, dear mother, </p>
