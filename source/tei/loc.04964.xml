                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have to thank you for the copy of the "<hi rend="underline">Philadelphia
                    Enquirer</hi>" of the 12<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst, which I received this
                morning. I was very pleased to read the paragraph marked, and still more pleased by
                the kind remembrance &#38; consideration which prompted you to send it.</p>
            <p>I wish that,<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02210.jpg" type="verso"/> besides the
                information it gives as to what you are doing, it had also said how you were. By its
                account of your "buoyant spirits," and of your "getting outdoors in good weather" it
                indirectly conveys a good impression of your health, but I am anxious to hear a more
                authentic account. I earnestly hope that you are much better than when you wrote
                last.<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02211.jpg" type="recto"/> D<hi
                rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> received a long &#38; most
                kind &#38; interesting letter yesterday from J. A. Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> which he
                sent on to me to read. He intended to forward a copy to you by this mail, &#38; I have
                no doubt but that he will do so.</p>
            <p>Symonds's letter is so kind, &#38; so pathetic in its interest, that I am inclined to
                write to him myself;&#8212;and, if a favourable opportunity presents itself, I will
                do so.<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02212.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <hi rend="underline">Your</hi> name will be a sufficient warrant for my intruding
                upon his Alpine solitude and 7 months winter&#8212;in "broken health" &#38; "meditations
                upon the problem of approaching death" (referred to in the Preface to his last
                Essays<ptr target="loc.04964_n2"/>)&#8212;with a note of friendliness &#38; sympathy&#8212;with no little of
                reverence and gratitude too. God bless him.</p>

            <p>We have had a very seasonable Christmas here.&#8212;snow on the ground with slight
                frost, rather dull &#38; overcast, with heavy snowfall in the evening.</p>
            <p>We had a slight thaw for a day or two previously, but it seems likely to revert to
                frost again. Last week end&#8212;while the keen frost continued &#38; the trees were
                hung with rime&#8212;we had two of<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02214.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> the most lovely moonlight nights here I ever remember to have
                seen. The country about Rivington&#8212;near here was beautiful beyond description.
                I only wish that I had the time &#38; the power to give you some account of it. But <hi
                    rend="underline">one</hi> element in a description of its effect upon me as I
                walked through it would lie in the influences your books have<pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc_vm.02215.jpg" type="recto"/> had on me to make me receptive to its
                marvellous &#38; mystic beauty. Thanks to you.&#8212;and love to you&#8212;now and
                always.</p>
            <p>When you get this we shall have entered upon a new year. I hope that it may bring you
                renewed health and strength &#38; blessedness &#38; joy. All good be with you, &#38; the
                increasing love of<pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.02216.jpg" type="verso"/> an
                increasing number of those who are entering upon the blessed fruits of the long 
                travail of your
                soul.</p> 
            <p>With love &#38; best wishes</p>
