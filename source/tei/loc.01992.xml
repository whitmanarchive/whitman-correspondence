            <p>at last I have got started to reply to your

                forgotten you, but far from it<space extent="4 letters"/>I think of you every day
                and always with Love.</p>
            <p>I have promised myself every week since I received your letter that I would write to
                you and as often I have failed to keep my promise.</p>

            <p>I do not remember whether I ever told you or not that Father was insane at
                times<!--link/annotation: See <xref doc="loc.02000">Letter from Henry Wilson to Walt Whitman, January 17, 1867</xref> in which Henry Wilson writes about his time in the "Lunatic Asylum."-->,
                we have had him in the asylum at <name>Utica</name> nearly two years,
                but it is now two years since he left that place, &amp; he has been a source of
                anxiety to Us since as well as before he went there, we are afraid he is
                out<!-- I can also see "not" here. -JS --> of his head now a little.</p>
            <p>When he left here he said he was going to <name>New York</name> as agent
                for a firm in this city &amp; the next we hear of him he is in <name>Washington</name> trying to get some
                Patent<!-- Might have been misspelled as "Pattent," but the point is moot - hence I simply make note. -JS -->
                which we would be very glad if he would come home &amp; let it alone.</p>

            <p>I have commenced work again after being idle nearly three months, and I am very glad
                to have something to do once more.</p>
            <p>The weather has been very cold for the last three days &amp; we have had good
                sleighing nearly all winter.</p>
            <p>Mother &amp; My Wife send their regards to you.</p>
            <p>I will try and write more promptly next time, so good bye for the Present.</p>
