            </opener>
            <p>at last I have got started to reply to your letter,<ptr target="n5005"/> recd
                some weeks ago. I do not know but you think by this time
                that I have forgotten you, but far from it I think of you every day and always with
                Love.</p>
            <p>I have promised myself every week since I received your letter that I would write to
                you and as often I have failed to keep my promise.</p>
            <p>Mother recd a letter from Father<ptr target="n0811"/> to day stating that he had seen
                you several <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01992.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                times since he came to Washington.</p>
            <p>I do not remember whether I ever told you or not that Father was insane at times, 
                we have had him in the asylum at Utica nearly two years,
                but it is now two years since he left that place, &amp; he has been a source of
                anxiety to Us since as well as before he went there, we are afraid he is out of his
                head now a little.</p>
            <p>When he left here he said he was going to New York as agent for a firm in this city
                &amp; the next we hear of him he is in Washington trying to get some Patent which we
                would be very glad if he would come home &amp; let it alone.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01992.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I have commenced work again after being idle nearly three months, and I am very glad
                to have something to do once more.</p>
            <p>The weather has been very cold for the last three days &amp; we have had good
                sleighing nearly all winter.</p> 
            <p>Mother<ptr target="loc.01997_n3"/> &amp; My Wife<ptr target="loc.01987_n6"/> send their regards to you.</p>
            <p>I will try and write more promptly next time, so good bye for the Present.</p>
