            </opener>
            <p>I have just finished the work of a busy day &amp; I thought I would
                write you a line or two by this mail (which goes in half an hour) just to send you a word of affectionate sympathy &amp; loving greeting.
            </p>
            <p>Two hours ago I received another good kind letter (of May 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi>) from our mutual friend
                H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> in which
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02475.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                he tells me that there was then "no change" in you, &amp; that you had not been out, of late. This we are sorry
                to hear &amp; it grieves us much to know that you are not gaining strength as we expected. But as that letter was
                written 11 days ago it may not represent your present condition by any means; &amp; we devoutly
                hope that by this time things are better with you, that the weather &amp; other circumstances have
                favoured you &amp; allowed you to get out a little now &amp; then. God grant that this

                may be so, my dear brave old Friend!
            </p>
            <p>I met Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> in the street this afternoon &amp; we had 10 minutes' 
                talk&#8212;a good deal of it about you, wondering how you were &amp;c.
            </p>
            <p>I send you a Manchester paper in which you will see your name quoted.
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing very new with us here. The weather keeps very changeable&#8212;one day bright, sunny, warm &amp; genial &amp; the
                next cool &amp; dull,&#8212;but the vegetation is progressing wonderfully; the beautiful green fans expanding and
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02475.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                covering the bare branches, the grass greening, the flowers opening &amp;the birds carolling in vernal-born ecstasy.
            </p>
            <p>If only we could be assured of <hi rend="underline">your</hi> recovery how glad our hearts would be today! But we
                cease not to think of you &amp; to hope for you&#8212;
            </p>
            <p>Good night to you &amp; God bless you now &amp; always! is the heartfelt &amp; oft repeated prayer of 
            </p>
