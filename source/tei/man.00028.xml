                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute></opener>

            <p>I had a call a week or two ago<ptr target="n0141b"/> from a Cambridge fellow lecturer <hi rend="underline"
                >R. D. Roberts</hi>&#8212;a Welshman. He is starting for America the 20<hi
                    rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month&#8212;going to Iowa to spend some time
                on a farm there, then returning to England. Wants very much to see you en <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="man_ej.00185_large.jpg" type="verso"/>route. He has
                asked me to write and find out where you will be the first week of August. I suppose
                you won't mind seeing him if anywhere within call. He seems a very genuine fellow (I never saw
                him before) but is rather diffident about bothering you. Says you mention Wales or
                the Welsh <hi rend="underline">twice</hi> in your book! Could you send a postcard
                Robert D. Roberts Post Office, New York&#8212;saying <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="man_ej.00186_large.jpg" type="recto"/>where you will be early in August?
                Anyhow I will tell him to call at your address in Camden.</p>

            <p>I have received a letter from Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>&#8212;which I shall answer presently. I like
                his address to the Teachers Association very much. Thanks for several papers you
                have sent lately. I do enjoy this outdoor life and digging potatoes&#8212;and never
                mean to abandon either again! I am <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="man_ej.00050_large.jpg" type="verso"/>living with a man&#8212;the best
                friend I ever had or could think to have&#8212;an iron worker, scythe riveter, and
                his little family. He often says 'I wish Walt Whitman would come over here'. Below
                my window here there is a wooded bank running down to some water, and beyond again
                about 2 miles off the hilly undulating line of the Derbyshire moors&#8212;from which
                there comes a broad fresh breeze&#8212;like being near the sea.</p>

                <salute>Yours, dear friend,</salute>
