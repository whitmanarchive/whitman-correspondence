            </opener>
            <p>Your letter came to me just when I most needed the comfort of it&#8212;when I was watching and tending my 
                dear Mother as she gently, slowly, with but little suffering, sank to rest. There was no sick bed to sit 
                by.&#8212;We got her up and out into the air and sunshine for an hour or two even the day before she died&#8212;No

                disease, only the stomach could not do its work any longer &amp; for the last three weeks she lived wholly 
                on stimulants, suffering somewhat from sickness. She drew her last breath very gently, before daybreak on 
                the 15th <choice><abbr>inst.</abbr><expan>instant</expan></choice>, in her 90th year, which she had entered in 
                <choice><abbr>Jan</abbr><expan>January</expan></choice>. 
                She looked very beautiful in death, notwithstanding her great age&#8212;as well she might&#8212;tranquil 
                sunset that it was of a beautiful day&#8212;a fulfilled life&#8212;joy &amp; delight of her father in youth 
                (who used to call her the apple of his eye) good wife, devoted, 
                self-wise<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00359.jpg"/>sacrificing,
                 mother&#8212;patient, courageous sufferer through thirty years of chronic rheumatism (which however 
                neutralized &amp; ceased its pains the last few years) unsurpassed &amp; indeed I think unsurpassable, in 
                conscientiousness&#8212;in the strong sense of duty &amp; perfect obedience to that highest sense&#8212;she 
                is one of those who amply justify your large faith in women.</p>
            <p>I do not need to tell you anything my dearest friend&#8212;you know all&#8212;I feel your strong comforting 
                hand&#8212;I press it very close.</p>

                the comfort your dear letter was &amp; is to me. Thinking over &amp; over the few words you say of 
                yourself&#8212;&amp; what is said in the paper (so eagerly read&#8212;every word so welcome) I cannot help 
                fancying that the return of the distressing sensations in the head must be caused by your having worked at 
                the book&#8212;the "Two Rivulets"<ptr target="loc.02250_n7"/> (I dearly <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">love</unclear> 
                the title &amp; the idea of bringing the Poems &amp; Prose together so)&#8212;that you must be more patient 
                with yourself and submit still to perfect rest&#8212;&amp; that perhaps in regard to the stomach&#8212;you 
                have not enough adapted your diet to the privation of exercise&#8212;that you must be more indulgent to the 
                stomach too in the sense of giving it only the very easiest &amp; simplest work to do.</p>
