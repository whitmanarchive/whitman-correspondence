            <p>Your letter came &amp; I ought to have written to you before, but one thing &amp;
                another prevented. I was up to Germantown, to a friend's, where I have been a good
                deal lately,—Spent the Christmas &amp; New Year holidays there<ptr target="loc.03998_n1"/>—they came for me, so I went &amp; was glad—a
                big house full of people, old &amp; young folks, &amp; plenty of fun &amp; every
                thing good—lots of oysters—&amp; <choice>

                    <expan>cooked</expan>
                </choice> so nice—I never knew how much there is in the cooking—Otherways I have been here in <choice>
                    <abbr>C.</abbr>
                    <expan>Camden</expan>
                </choice> all the time, have done a little work writing, but nothing much,—My
                brother from St Louis has been on here with us for a while—&amp; I have callers
                &amp; visitors quite often—</p>
            <p>Ruth I got your letter—it was very acceptable—I will answer it
                    before long<ptr target="loc.03998_n5"/></p>

            <p>How are you all? I hope this will find you all well—little George<ptr target="loc.03998_n2"/> is all right again I trust by this time—I met two
                jolly &amp; good-looking Jersey boys this afternoon over in Market Street,
                <choice><abbr>Phila.</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice>—it was Elmer and Ed Stafford<ptr target="loc.03998_n3"/>—we had a
                little talk—did me good to meet them—I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> think Jersey has two nicer
                looking boys—I was on my way to West Philadelphia to see about a Mr Anders, an
                elderly man sick with consumption. <hi rend="underline">Young</hi> Mr Anders and I had
                got acquainted in Canada two years ago, &amp; quite attached to each other—he
                was a soldier there—I got a letter from him from Montreal day before
                yesterday, asking me to go to a certain number in West <choice><abbr>Phila:</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice> &amp; see his father,
                who had come on here some time ago quite sick—Young A. wanted me to see &amp;
                write to him how the father was particular—So I went up to-day—when I
                got there I found the elder A. was <hi rend="underline">dead &amp; buried</hi>—so
                I have just had to write the sad intelligence to my Canada friend<ptr target="loc.03998_n4"/>—love to you &amp; all</p>
