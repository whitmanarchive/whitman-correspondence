                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>It is impossible for me to write much now, but I want to get a letter off by this
                mail in acknowledgement of your very kind post card to hand this
                morning.&#8212;Thanks to you indeed!</p>

            <p>Yes! I received your portrait "in good order"&#8212;and with emotions which I have
                already tried to indicate.&#8212;Apart from its existence<note type="authorial"
                    place="left">a photo: the last taken half length like the one you have</note><pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02169.jpg" type="verso"/> value to me as a gift
                from yourself, I find its <hi rend="underline">intrinsic</hi> merit very great
                indeed.&#8212;It has "<hi rend="underline">grown</hi>" upon me very much, and
                authenticates itself, to my mind, more and more, as a true characteristic portrait.
                Indeed, I am delighted with it. (Certainly, <hi rend="underline">far</hi> better
                than the "<hi rend="underline">Illustrated News</hi>" one!)</p>



            <p>I wished to carry out your instructions literally, + to put it in place of the other
                in the same frame.&#8212;But it did not fit quite satisfactorily so I decided<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02170.jpg" type="recto"/> to have a new frame
                made like the old one (plain oak 3" wide) and to use the old frame for something
                else.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/>, too, has had the portrait
                you gave him (of yourself&#8212;painted by Sidney Morse) framed, (gold mat + frame)
                and is very pleased with it</p>
            <p>He called on me at noon today + I shewed him your post card. He is deeply sensible of
                your great loving-kindness + your solicitude about him. He has improved in health
                    since<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02171.jpg" type="verso"/> his return, +
                is, I think, very well now.</p>
            <p>He kindly brought me, as a present, the two vols. of "<hi rend="underline"
                    >Essays</hi>" by J. A. Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> which I have not yet read. I
                have glanced them over + find much to stir my appetite.</p>
            <p>But I must not write more now.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>With the deepest love gratitude + reverence to you always, Dr. Johnston
                    joining me</salute>
                <salute>I remain</salute>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
