                <salute> Dear Mr. Walt Whitman </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I expect you are plagued with a good many letters, so I want to explain why all the
                same I mean to write this &#38; ask you to do something for us.</p>
            <p>Shd. I care in yr. place to be plagued by "sympathizers" wanting things? Probably
                not. But yet it cheers one to think one's words are welcome &#38; have borne fruit
                in distant lands. So anyway I thought you wd. like to know that we here (my boys
                &#38; we masters) had been reading yr. "Gospel of Comradeship,"&#8212;yes in our
                School Chapel too, not caring for brother Grundy &#38; old wifes talk of
                "Inspiration" &#38; "Canons <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03578.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> of Scripture; but reading that Gospel with many more. This we
                thought would cheer you up, &#38; hoped, knowing how "Leaves of Grass" had cheered
                up us English, men &#38; boys.</p> 
            <p>Now our fellows here have taken the Gospel to heart &#38; have wished "The Love of
                Comrades" for their 
                <hi rend="underline">School Song</hi>.<ptr target="loc.03578_n1"/> 
                And one boy has tried to give it an English &#38; school dress, to suit our case.
                I enclose the result.</p>
            <p>Now I don't believe you will be offended at his presumption. Yr. song is for
                Americans, &#38; this one here like most good Englishmen today feel America more
                than a cousin, yet we want<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03578.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> a song more suited to our purpose.</p>
            <p>Now it wd. be a swell thing to have a song straight from yr. fingers, or a 
                least a line from you
                about this. So I write, this feeling it an intrusion when you have so many to think
                of, to ask if you will not write us a few lines.</p>
            <p>We are using the music written by a friend of mine for that comrade song in Edward
                    Carpenter's<ptr target="n0141b"/> Chants of Labour,<ptr target="loc.03578_n2"/> no. 35, which book I send.
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03578.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>We are trying
                to educate our boys to be <hi rend="underline">men</hi>. For English Education has
                been &#38; is too much a function of neat trousers a mere tiny affair.</p>
            <p>We want them to have something rousing for their song&#8212;not merely
                English but world-wide. England is having queer times, but the juice is still
                here. Give us a Battle Cry; we will get music &#38; lungs &#38; hearts. And whether
                you feel well enough to do this for us accept our love &#38; gratitude for yr life
                 &#38; example.</p>
