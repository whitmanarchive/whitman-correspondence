            </opener>
            <p>I called on you this evening but did not get to see you and take the liberty to
                trouble you with the reading of this little note. I have read "As a strong bird on
                pinions free" and can hardly express my admiration for your poetry. To me it is
                grand and beautiful and I am anxious to see you and talk with you about it. If you
                can spare the time, and as you told me you would only be at home Monday and Tuesday
                in the evening, will you write a few lines telling me when it will suit you to have
                me come over again. I am so much afraid of intruding upon you that a little note of
                assurance will I think make me feel freer to come. I left the volume of Burns'
                letters for you, the book you loaned me, and the one you gave me. The latter I
                thought I could treasure more closely if you would be kind enough to put your
                autograph in it and I hope you will not think it immodest in my asking you to do so.
                I have been more deeply impressed with your poems than you will believe; I think the
                dirge on Lincoln is as fine and beautiful a thing in that way that I have ever read.
                I must read all your writings over and over again. I pray you forgive me for having
                detained you so long with this boyish note and believe me&#8212;</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Sincerely Yours</salute>
