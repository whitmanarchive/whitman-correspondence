                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute> 
            </opener>
                <p>Last evening I went to Johnston's<ptr target="n4102"/> to tea &#38; spent an hour with him before coming on here. 
                 We talked of you &#38; discussed the probability of the arrival of the mail &#38;c. Just after tea your postcard
                of the 18<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04723_n3"/> arrived &#38; was greeted by cheers from us both. We were heartily
                pleased to receive it, &#38; to read its
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01258_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                cheering words. I made a hasty facsimile of it to bring home, which now lies before me.</p>
                <p>I am very glad to note that you were recovering from the effects of "the fearful unprecedented
                three days hot spell" &#38; were apparently in such good spirits. And blessings on the "two
                dear little boys"<ptr target="loc.04723_n6"/> whose "delicious chatter" at the time of writing freshened &#38; delighted
                you. As I get older I appreciate more &#38; more the primal freshness &#38; sweetness of children,
                &#38; their innocent
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01259_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                gladness &#38; beauty. (Some little beauties near here.) I hope the two in question may retain
                these qualities through life, with graver ones added, as children of yours.</p>
                <p>I found Johnston pretty well recovered from his accident, of which I believe he has told you.</p>
                <p>The parcel of "Good Bye's"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> &#38; portraits not yet received, but will probably come next mail. 
                I will notify you on its arrival.</p>
                <p>I expect to receive Lippincott's<ptr target="loc.07874_n5"/> tomorrow or the day
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01260_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                following.</p>
                <p>The sultry weather of last week has passed, &#38; cooler delightful weather set in.
                Has been a beautiful day today (though occasionally threatening) &#38; the evening has
                been especially lovely, with the most beautiful roseate sky &#38; clouds.</p>
            <p>The Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi> S. Thompson<ptr target="loc.04723_n4"/>&#8212;minister of the little Unitarian
                chapel at Rivington (built 1703&#8212;originally, and still nominally Presbyterian) called
                here this evening on his way home, &#38; I walked to Rivington with him
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01261_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I never saw a more beautiful evening, &#38; the charmingly idyllic country looked its best.
                The air was sweet &#38; calm, but with a just felt breeze,&#8212;a slight pensive
                mist half veiling the distant landscape. I was quite loathe to return indoors, but I wanted
                to send you a few lines &#38; it was getting late.</p>
                <p>Thompson (an elderly, white bearded man, with healthy fresh complexion, clear honest
                grey eyes, &#38; cordial friendly grasp &#38; speech) always enquires the latest news about
                you,
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01262_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                &#38; honours you highly&#8212;&#38; more &#38; more as he knows you better. I spoke of
                writing &#38; offered to convey his regards to you, &#38; he seemed very pleased &#38; quite
                affected by it. He thought it might seem "presumption," but he was glad to send you his warmest
                regards &#38; best wishes.</p>
                <p>Just before he came I had been reading in the 1855 edition of L. of G. My copy has a few
                press notices pasted in at the end, &#38; I read some of these again.
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01263_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    ("United States Review"&#8212;"American Phrenological Journal" &#38; Brooklyn Daily Times."<ptr target="loc.04723_n5"/>)
                I wondered again who had written these.&#8212;It seems strange to me that since such
                appreciative notices appeared so soon after the first appearance of L. of G. your recognition
                should have proceeded so slowly. But it is very certain, &#38; will be all the more
                complete &#38; passionate because of the delay.</p>
                <p>But I must close.
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01264_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                With constant love &#38; prayerful God speed
            </p>

                <p>I write this in a field on my way to one of our buildings some 7 miles out of Bolton. Beautiful
                morning, grass in its full glory (haymaking just commencing in a few fields) a willow-wren
                singing its plaintive song close by, &#38; a lark shaking
                down its ecstatic carol from the sky oerhead.<ptr target="loc.04723_n2"/></p>
