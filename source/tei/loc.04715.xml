                <salute>My dear old friend,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>For a fortnight now we have had no word from anyone as to your condition, &#38; it pains
                me very much to think that it may be that there has been no improvement in it. We are wearying 
                to hear about you; but I cherish the hope that the preparations for your birthday,<ptr target="loc.02497_n5"/> the additional
                correspondence it would entail, &#38; the sending away of copies               
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01200_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                 
                of your 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi> Annex<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> are a sufficient explanation of the silence. My loving
                good wishes to you anyhow.</p>        
            <p>After a week of dull skies, low temperature &#38; frequent rain, Saturday &#38; Sunday (May 30 &#38; 31)
                were gloriously fine, warm &#38; sunny.&#8212;</p>            
            <p>R.K. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> came here to spend the week end with me, 
                &#38; on Sunday afternoon Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> &#38; Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> 
                came out.&#8212;Greenhalgh &#38; I spent most of the time out doors, rambling about
                the beautiful country at Rivington. (L. of G. with us, from which I frequently read aloud.)                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01201_large.jpg" type="recto"/>                
                On Sunday afternoon Johnston, Greenhalgh &#38; I went to a shaded bank, where we sat amongst 
                the trees, overlooking the lake &#38; the sunlit country &#38; hills &#38; moors beyond. 
                I there talked informally for an hour or so about you &#38; more especially about your religious 
                teaching&#8212;reading extracts from L. of G.&#8212;Our seclusion, the marvellous beauty of the day
                &#38; of the widespread peaceful landscape, (entirely rural) the rustling of leaves in the breeze 
                &#38; the songs of birds&#8212;all contributed to our study &#38; talk, &#38; gave effect to your words.&#8212;</p>               
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01202_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                
            <p>Johnston had to leave soon after tea&#8212;after which Dixon G. &#38; I went to a small wood 
                near here, where we sat, looking towards the sunset&#8212;the air balmy &#38; sweet, 
                the birds singing their evening concert &#38; a cuckoo calling near. I again led the talk&#8212;this time, 
                as befitted the hour &#38; scene, about your present condition, &#38; all that it implies&#8212;reading 
                some of your later poems. We thought of you with swelling hearts of tenderness, &#38; love, &#38; it 
                was agreed to send you some expression of our heartfelt love &#38; prayerful "God speed."</p>               
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01203_large.jpg" type="recto"/>                
            <p>It was a memorable day for us all&#8212;not to be forgotten. The full glory of the day, 
                the mellow tenderness &#38; beauty of the evening, the sweet influences of the early summer, 
                and&#8212;running through it all&#8212;our thoughts of <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, 
                our speculations as to how you were &#38; what you would be doing, of your friends who
                are also <hi rend="underline">our</hi> friends&#8212;all combined to make it sacred &#38; blessed.</p>
            <p>Our unending love to you, honour &#38; blessing&#8212;dearest of friends, greatest &#38; most loved 
                of benefactors.</p>
