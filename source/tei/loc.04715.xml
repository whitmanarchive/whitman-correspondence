                <salute>My dear old friend,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>For a fortnight now we have had no word from anyone as to your condition, &amp; it pains
                me very much to think that it may be that there has been no improvement in it. We are wearying 
                to hear about you; but I cherish the hope that the preparations for your birthday,<ptr target="loc.02497_n5"/> the additional
                correspondence it would entail, &amp; the sending away of copies               
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01200_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                 
                of your 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi> Annex<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> are a sufficient explanation of the silence. My loving
                good wishes to you anyhow.</p>        
            <p>After a week of dull skies, low temperature &amp; frequent rain, Saturday &amp; Sunday (May 30 &amp; 31)
                were gloriously fine, warm &amp; sunny.—</p>            
            <p>R.K. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> came here to spend the week end with me, 
                &amp; on Sunday afternoon Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> &amp; Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> 
                came out.—Greenhalgh &amp; I spent most of the time out doors, rambling about
                the beautiful country at Rivington. (L. of G. with us, from which I frequently read aloud.)                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01201_large.jpg" type="recto"/>                
                On Sunday afternoon Johnston, Greenhalgh &amp; I went to a shaded bank, where we sat amongst 
                the trees, overlooking the lake &amp; the sunlit country &amp; hills &amp; moors beyond. 
                I there talked informally for an hour or so about you &amp; more especially about your religious 
                teaching—reading extracts from L. of G.—Our seclusion, the marvellous beauty of the day
                &amp; of the widespread peaceful landscape, (entirely rural) the rustling of leaves in the breeze 
                &amp; the songs of birds—all contributed to our study &amp; talk, &amp; gave effect to your words.—</p>               
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01202_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                
            <p>Johnston had to leave soon after tea—after which Dixon G. &amp; I went to a small wood 
                near here, where we sat, looking towards the sunset—the air balmy &amp; sweet, 
                the birds singing their evening concert &amp; a cuckoo calling near. I again led the talk—this time, 
                as befitted the hour &amp; scene, about your present condition, &amp; all that it implies—reading 
                some of your later poems. We thought of you with swelling hearts of tenderness, &amp; love, &amp; it 
                was agreed to send you some expression of our heartfelt love &amp; prayerful "God speed."</p>               
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01203_large.jpg" type="recto"/>                
            <p>It was a memorable day for us all—not to be forgotten. The full glory of the day, 
                the mellow tenderness &amp; beauty of the evening, the sweet influences of the early summer, 
                and—running through it all—our thoughts of <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, 
                our speculations as to how you were &amp; what you would be doing, of your friends who
                are also <hi rend="underline">our</hi> friends—all combined to make it sacred &amp; blessed.</p>
            <p>Our unending love to you, honour &amp; blessing—dearest of friends, greatest &amp; most loved 
                of benefactors.</p>
