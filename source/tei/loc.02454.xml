            <postscript>
                <p>P.S. JWW's birthday gift to me was a beautifully <gap reason="illegible"
                        unit="chars" quantity="3"/> up book&#8212;"Familiar Wild birds."<pb
                        xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02454.005.jpg" type="recto"/> The presentation
                    was made by J. W. Wallace in a graceful and appropriate speech in which he spoke
                    of some of the qualities of mind and heart wich have endeared Mr Hutton to us
                    all and which he (J.W.W.) has referred to in one of his letters to you. He spoke
                    of him as a man who instead of shirking the "spectres of the mind" as so many
                    clergymen do has boldly faced + slain them + has emerged from the conflict
                    strengthened + with a purer + loftier faith. He is an altogether splendid fellow
                    + although he belongs to a class with whom we have not much sympathy we can talk
                    to him quite<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02454.006.jpg" type="verso"/> freely
                    + unconstrainedly on any subject, conscious that in him we shall find true
                    sympathy, comfort + help. He is by far the best "parson" I have ever known + his
                    manly outspokeness his transparent sincerity, his broad-minded charity, his
                    tender sympathy, his kind-heartedness, his high-mindedness and his deep +
                    sincere love for his fellows have won for him the esteem + affection of troops
                    of friends; + I think that the mere fact of his being such an honoured + trusted
                    member of our little circle of friends composed as it is of such heterogenous
                    elements speaks volumes of praise for this "Prince among parsons."<pb
                        xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02454.007.jpg" type="recto"/> He has a genuine
                    regard for you + frequently quotes from L. of G. in his sermons at the Parish
                    Church.</p>
                <p>In his reply to the presentation speeches he said that when he first saw J. W.
                    W.'s pocket book copy he felt envious. A more acceptable present could not have
                    been selected +, opening the book + turning over its leaves he said "this book
                    seems to bring him (i.e. <hi rend="underline">you</hi>) very near to me + there
                    seems to be an air of himself about it." It was because we knew that you were
                    with us in spirit + because the book had come straight from your hands that we
                        ventured<pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02454.008.jpg" type="verso"/> to put
                    "from Walt Whitman" upon it.</p>
                <p>After the presentation I read aloud your kind letter to me also "Warry's" + Dr.
                        Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> + conveyed to them your "loving salutation" to
                    them all which they received with acclamation.</p>
                <p>Your portrait was hanging in the room. So you see that you were really "one of
                    us" + we feel sure that you were "one with us" too.</p>
