            <p>By this mail I am sending you the Christmas number of the <hi rend="underline">Review
                    of Reviews</hi> in which, at pages 581 &amp; 592 you will find your beautiful poem
                "To the Sunset breeze"<ptr target="loc.02454_n4"/> &amp; your article "Old Poets"<ptr target="loc.02454_n5"/> quoted—the no. is an unusually varied &amp; interesting
                one.</p>
            <p>I have forwarded copies of my "Notes"<ptr target="loc.02454_n1"/> with short letters to all the friends whose
                names you gave me This morning I rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> a letter of
                acknowledgement from R Pearsall Smith<ptr target="n4979"/> (London) in which he
                speaks of you as "the statuesque old man" &amp; as "one of the landmarks of literary
                history."</p>
            <p>Since receiving your <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#smb">last</unclear>

                I have been much troubled about
                you &amp; am very anxious
                to learn how you are keeping. Better I hope. I sent a brief p.c. to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> which I hope he will reply to immediately; &amp; if it w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> not be troubling him too much, I sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> be greatly obliged if he w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> kindly drop me a
                line or two if only on a p.c., say once a week, while your illness continues.</p>
            <p>When I think of you, my dear old friend, prostrated by bodily illness, suffering
                physical pain &amp;, for the most part, <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> my heart yearns
                to ward you &amp; I long to be able to do something to help you. But alas! I can do
                nothing but write &amp; assure you of my tender sympathy &amp; of my heartfelt &amp; daily
                deepening affection for you. God ble<supplied reason="torn-away" resp="#smb" cert="high">ss</supplied> &amp; <supplied reason="torn-away" resp="#smb" cert="high">Ke</supplied>ep you now &amp; always

                to you than to any other man living or dead &amp; who will ever hold you in the highest
                reverence &amp; love.</p>
            <p>This has been a disagreeable day here— the ground is thicker covered with snow,
                the wind is Easterly &amp; cutting, there is
                a keen frost &amp; the whole town &amp; neighbourhood are enveloped in a thick fog. This morning I had <gap reason="torn-away" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> 
                hours driving in my open conveyance I c<hi rend="underline">d</hi> not take my brougham—&amp; the all-prevalent moisture condensed on my
                beard &amp; moustache &amp; froze into tiny icicles which had to be thawed off. It was about
                as unpleasant an experience as I ever remember but now that I have seen the last of
                the patients in the surgery &amp; had a bit of dinner I am feeling warm &amp; comfortable
                again &amp; am writing this letter to you on my literary machine<ptr target="loc.02454_n6"/> (the boys' prese<supplied reason="torn-away" resp="#smb" cert="high">nt)</supplied><pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02454.004.jpg" type="verso"/> before a nice warm fire in an open
                fireplace &amp; with my dear wife reading beside me.</p>
            <p>I rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> a letter from Mr Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> in which he tells me that he has

                W. Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> wrote for my birthday party.</p>
            <p>And now I must bring this badly written letter to a close by wishing you the compliments 
                of the festive seasons
                &amp; a speedy return to health or <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">some</unclear>
                measure of health as may be expected at your time of life &amp; under your circumstances.</p>
            <p>With my kindest regards to all the members of your household &amp; with my best
                heart's-love to you</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>P.S. JWW's birthday gift to me was a beautifully got up book—"Familiar Wild birds."<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02454.005.jpg" type="recto"/> The presentation
                    was made by J. W. Wallace in a graceful and appropriate speech in which he spoke
                    of some of the qualities of mind and heart which have endeared Mr Hutton<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> to us
                    all and which he (J.W.W.) has referred to in one of his letters to you. He spoke
                    of him as a man who instead of shirking the "spectres of the mind" as so many
                    clergymen do has boldly faced &amp; slain them &amp; has emerged from the conflict
                    strengthened &amp; with a purer &amp; loftier faith.<ptr target="loc.02454_n2"/> He is an altogether splendid fellow
                    &amp; although he belongs to a class with whom we have not much sympathy we can talk
                    to him quite<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02454.006.jpg" type="verso"/> freely
                    &amp; unconstrainedly on any subject, conscious that in him we shall find true
                    sympathy, comfort &amp; help. He is by far the best "parson" I have ever known &amp; his
                    manly outspokeness his transparent sincerity, his broad-minded charity, his
                    tender sympathy, his kind-heartedness, his high-mindedness and his deep &amp;
                    sincere love for his fellows have won for him the esteem &amp; affection of troops
                    of friends; &amp; I think that the mere fact of his being such an honoured &amp; trusted
                    member of our little circle of friends composed as it is of such heterogenous
                    elements speaks volumes of praise for this "Prince among parsons."<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02454.007.jpg" type="recto"/> He has a genuine
                    regard for you &amp; frequently quotes from L. of G. in his sermons at the Parish
                    Church.</p>   
                <p>In his reply to the presentation speeches he said that when he first saw J. W.
                    W.'s pocket book copy he felt envious. A more acceptable present could not have
                    been selected &amp;, opening the book &amp; turning over its leaves he said "this book
                    seems to bring him (i.e. <hi rend="underline">you</hi>) very near to me &amp; there
                    seems to be an air of himself about it." It was because we knew that you were
                    with us in spirit &amp; because the book had come straight from your hands that we
                        ventured<pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02454.008.jpg" type="verso"/> to put
                    "from Walt Whitman" upon it.</p>
                <p>After the presentation I read aloud your kind letter to me also "Warry's" &amp; Dr.
                        Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> &amp; conveyed to them your "loving salutation" to
                    them all which they received with acclamation.</p>
                <p>Your portrait was hanging in the room. So you see that you were really "one of
                    us" &amp; we feel sure that you were "one with us" too.</p>
