                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute> 
            </opener> 
            <p>A paper from you last night reminds me that it is time I again reported myself. We
                are back home again &#38; I am busy about my farm work. The spring is early, the
                robins are calling the old call about the place, the sparrows are singing the old
                songs, &#38; nature seems as fresh &#38; young as ever. My plough seems<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="uka_vm.00003.jpg" type="verso"/> to find as much fat in
                the ribs of old mother Earth as ever it did &#38; it looks just as sweet. I am very
                glad to be back again, &#38; to get at some real work. On the 5<hi rend="underline"
                    >th</hi> of March I went to NY. for a week; stayed with Gilder<ptr
                        target="n0871"/> &#38; then with Johnson<ptr target="uka.00003_n4"/>; had a
                pretty good time. Saw some of the small literary fry, dined with Gilder at the
                Fellowcraft Club of which he is president, met George Kennan<ptr target="n7003"/> of
                whom I think highly, met Mrs Custer<ptr target="n5001"/> &#38; Mrs Cleveland<ptr target="uka.00003_n3"/><pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="uka_vm.00004.jpg" type="recto"/>
                both charming women. Charles DeKay<ptr target="n7002"/> is married &#38; is stout 
                &#38; handsome.<ptr target="uka.00003_n2"/> Gilder is very busy, goes out a good
                deal, but finds time to write some poetry still. He owns a house now in Clinton
                Place (8<hi rend="underline">th</hi> st.) Walked down to City hall &#38; was
                astonished to see the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> building towering up &#38;
                quite overshadowing the <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> building. Its architecture
                is fine &#38; makes the spotted &#38; clumsy character of the building of its rival
                look cheap enough.</p>
            <p>I am to have a new book this Spring, a collection of "Indoor Essays," rather a<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="uka_vm.00005.jpg" type="verso"/> piece of book-making
                business&#8212;not much worth.</p>
            <p>I hope you are comfortable these spring days, &#38; can nearly get a glimpse of the
                spring. I am well, but not very cheerful for some reason. Any news from
                    O'Connor,<ptr target="n2002"/> or yourself will be very welcome.</p>
