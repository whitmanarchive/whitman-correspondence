            <p>I hope you will not consider this letter from an utter stranger a liberty. Indeed, I hardly feel a stranger to you, nor is this the first letter that I have written to you. My friend Edward Dowden<!-- annotation --> has told me often that you like new acquaintances or I should rather say friends.  And as an old friend I send you an <choice><sic>inclosure</sic><corr>enclosure</corr></choice>

                which may interest you. Four years ago I wrote the enclosed draft of a letter which I intended to copy out and send to you&#8212;it has lain in my desk since then&#8212;when I had heard that you were addressed as <hi rend="underline">Mr.</hi> Whitman. It speaks for itself and needs no comment. It is as truly what I wanted to say as that light is light. The four years which have elapsed have made me love your work four fold<!-- bold[?] --> and I can truly say that I have ever spoken as your friend.  You know what

                hostile criticism your work sometimes evokes here, and I wage a perpetual war with many friends on your behalf. But I am glad to say that I have been the means of making your work known to many who were scoffers at first. The years which have passed have not been uneventful to me, and I have felt and thought and suffered much in them, and I can truly say that from you I have had much pleasure and much consolation&#8212;and
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01945.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>I do believe that your often <del type="strikethrough" cert="high" resp="#js">earenst</del> earnest speech has not been thrown away on me or that my life &amp; thoughts fail to be marked with its impress&#8212;I write this openly because I feel that with you one must be open. We have just had tonight a hot debate on your genius at the Fortnightly Club<!-- annotation --> in which I had the privilege of putting forward my views&#8212;I think with success. Do not think me "cheeky" for writing this. I only hope we may sometime meet &amp; I shall be able perhaps to say what I cannot write. Dowden promised to get me a copy of your new edition, and I hope that for any other work which you may have you will let me always be an early subscriber. I am sorry you are not strong. Many of us are hoping

to see you in Ireland.</p>
            <p>We had arranged to have a meeting for you. I do not know if you like getting letters. If you do I shall only be too happy to send you news of how thought goes among the men I know&#8212;With truest wishes for your health and happiness believe me</p>
