            <p>So our old dear friend O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> is gone at last.<ptr target="loc.07301_n4"/> Thank God that he died peacefully,<ptr
                target="loc.07301_n2"/> without pain.<ptr target="loc.02978_n1"/> My
                great regret is that with his magnificent abilities he should have done so
                comparatively little to keep his name alive. However he will be long
                remembered&#8212;if for nothing else&#8212;for the "Good Gray Poet" which will not
                be forgotten for a while yet.<ptr target="loc.07301_n3"/> His death will be a great
                grief and also a great relief to Mrs O'C.<ptr target="n4137"/> The care of him was
                almost more than she could bear. She will of course grieve bitterly but for her sake
                I am glad his life was not prolonged if it had been she must have broken down and
                that would <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00586.jpg" type="verso"/>have made
                things worse than ever. I believe, dear Walt, that it is all right and as it should
                be&#8212;and I trust when I come to die myself, as I must and ought in a little
                while, that I shall say the same thing. "We shall go to him though he will not come
                back to us" and when we <hi rend="underline">do</hi> go to him we shall see that
                there things are better managed than they would be if we had our way with them.</p>
            <p>Mrs O'Reilly (wife of the Inspector of Asylums) died yesterday morning&#8212;I go to
                Toronto to the funeral tomorrow&#8212;back next day.</p>
            <p>So we go one after the other&#8212;but it is all right&#8212;what good would it be to
                stay?</p>
