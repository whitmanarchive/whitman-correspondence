            </opener>
            <p>At the suggestion of a friend some weeks ago I began to read your poems, and have become so 
                much interested in them from my hasty perusal of them that I have decided to make them the 
                object of my studies during the present summer. I have one difficulty, however, and it is 
                the occasion of my writing this letter to you. From the various libraries of this city,&#8212;public 
                and private,&#8212;to which I have access, I
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_gt.00224_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                have been able to secure but two different editions, neither of which quite satisfied me. 
                One was "Leaves of Grass," published in Boston by Thayer and Eldridge,<ptr target="loc.00568_n3"/> 
                in 1860&#8211;61; the other was "Leaves of Grass", published in Philadelphia by David McKay,<ptr target="n4983"/> 
                in 1884. As I said above, neither of these quite satisfied me. The poems were classified in 
                each one in an entirely different manner from the other, which at times proved very confusing.</p>
            <p>I write to you, therefore, to ask if you will direct me where I can secure what 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_gt.00225_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                you consider the best edition of your poems, so that when I secure it I may feel that I possess 
                that which bears the author's mark of approval.</p>
            <p>Before closing this letter I wish to express my appreciation of the many beauties of your verses, 
                &#38; to testify as to the pleasure, comfort, and instruction they have put at my service.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Believe me,</salute>
                <salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>
                <signed>John Phillips Street.</signed>
