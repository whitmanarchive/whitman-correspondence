                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will bring me to my
                senses, for I am quite stunned at the first glance of London.
                I have just come from <choice><abbr>St.</abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice> <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice>
                &amp; feel very strange. I don't
                know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. <choice><abbr>St.</abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice> <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice> was too much for me
                &amp; my brain actually <choice><sic>reels</sic><corr>reels</corr></choice>. I have never seen architecture before. It made me
                drunk</p>
            <p>I have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01118.002.jpg" type="verso"/> now. I saw for the
                first time what power &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design&#8212;I
                felt for a moment what great genius was in this field.
                 But I had to retreat after sitting
                down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel as if I should go no where else
                while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was
                not prepared for it &amp; I <choice><sic>though</sic><corr>thought</corr></choice> my companions the Treasury clerks would drive me
                mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them &amp; sit down. Hereafter I must go
                alone everywhere. My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront
                these things all at once. I would
                give anything <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01118.003.jpg" type="recto"/> if you
                was here. I see now that you belong here&#8212;these things are akin to your spirit. You would see your own in <choice><abbr>St.</abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice> <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice>, but it took my breath away. It was more than I
                could bear &amp; I will have to gird up my loins &amp; try it many times. Outside it
                has the beauty &amp; grandeur of rocks and crags and ledges.
                It is nature &amp; art fused into
                one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It is
                like a Rembrandt<!-- Annotation? --> picture so strong &amp; deep is the light &amp; shade. It is more
                to see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little
                account, but now I get a glimpse of the real article I am overwhelmed. I had <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01118.004.jpg" type="verso"/> designed to go on the
                continent, but I shall not stir out of London till I have vanquished some part of
                it at least. If I <choice><sic>loose</sic><corr>lose</corr></choice> my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight.
                I only wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but
                shall try to find  Conway to morrow.
                I write you
                this dear Walt to help recover myself. I know it
                contains nothing you might expect to hear from me in London, but I have got into
                Niagara without knowing it &amp; you must bear with me. I will give facts &amp;
                details next time. Go &amp; see Ursula. </p>
            <closer>

                <p><date when="1871-10-04">Oct 4</date>&#8212;I went to day to see Conway but he was
                    not in&#8212;so I went back to <choice><abbr>St</abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice> <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice> to see if I really made a fool of myself
                    yesterday. I did not feel as before &amp; perhaps never shall again, yet it is
                    truly grand &amp; there is no mistake.
                    It is like the grandest
                    organ music put into form</p>
               
               <pb sameAs="#leaf001r" type="recto"/>
                <p>P. S. I hope you &amp; O'Connor will really make an effort to come over here. You need not mention it but I know it is not settled at all who will come. This you can rely upon, but there will be no more bonds sent till November.</p>
