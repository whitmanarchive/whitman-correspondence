                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will help bring me to my senses, for I am quite stunned at 
                the first glance of London. I have just come from St <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice> &#38; feel 
                very strange. I don't know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. St <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice> 
                was too much for me &#38; my brain actually reels. I have never seen 
                architecture before. It made me drunk I have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01118.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                now. I saw for the first time what power &#38; imagination could be put in form &#38; design&#8212;I felt for a moment 
                what great genius was in this field. But I had to retreat after sitting down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel 
                as if I should go no where else while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was not 
                prepared for it &#38; I <choice><sic>though</sic><corr>thought</corr></choice> my companions the Treasury clerks would 
                drive me mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them &#38; sit down. Hereafter I must go alone everywhere. My brain is 
                too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these things all at once. I would give anything 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01118.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                if you was here. I see now that you belong here&#8212;these things are akin to your spirit. You would see your own in 
                St <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice>, but it took my breath away. It was more than I could bear &#38; 
                I will have to gird up my loins &#38; try it many times. Out side it has the beauty &#38; 
                <choice><sic>grandure</sic><corr>grandeur</corr></choice> of rocks and crags and 
                ledges. It is nature &#38; art fused into one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It 
                is like a Rembrandt<ptr target="loc.01118_n1"/> picture so strong &#38; deep is the light &#38; shade. It is more to 
                see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little account, but now I get a glimpse of 
                the real article I am overwhelmed. I had 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01118.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                designed to go on the continent, but I shall not stir out of London till I have vanquished some part of it at least. If 
                I <choice><sic>loose</sic><corr>lose</corr></choice> my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight. I only 
                wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but shall try to find Conway<ptr target="n0170"/> 
                to morrow. I write you this dear Walt to help recover my self. I know it contains nothing you might expect to hear from me 
                in London, but I have got into Niagara without knowing it &#38; you must bear with me. I will give facts &#38; details next 
                time. Go &#38; see Ursula.<ptr target="n0130"/></p>

            <postscript>
                <p>Oct 4&#8212;I went to day to see Conway but he was not in&#8212;so I went back to St <choice><sic>Pauls</sic><corr>Paul's</corr></choice> 
                    to see if I really made a fool of myself yesterday. I did not feel as before &#38; perhaps never shall again, yet it is 
                    truly grand &#38; there is no mistake. It is like the grandest organ music put into form</p>                                
                <p>P. S. I hope you &#38; O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> will really make an effort to come over here. You need not
                    mention it but I know it is not settled at all who will come. This you can rely upon, but there will be no more
                    bonds sent till in November.</p>
