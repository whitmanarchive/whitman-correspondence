                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>Thanks to you for your kind p.c &#38; for your long &#38; interesting letter both of
                which I received yesterday<ptr target="n5005b"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am much grieved to hear of the death of your brother Jefferson<ptr target="n4995"/>
                which must have been a heavy blow to you &#38; one which I am sure you would feel
                most acutely. On behalf of the friends here &#38; myself I desire to tender you our
                sincere &#38; heartfelt sympathy in your sore bereavement. May the Great Healer
                &#38; Consoler pour His balm into your wounded heart &#38; give you of his sweet
                Peace &#38; Comfort!</p>
            <p>I am also extremely sorry to hear of your continued indisposition &#38; I hope that
                by this time things have taken a more favourable turn with you &#38; that<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02453.002.jpg" type="verso"/> your strong faith
                &#38; your vast store of long suffering patience, indomitable pluck and hopeful
                joyousness may bear you through these "gloomy blue days" as they have done so often
                before.</p>
            <p>I received a good letter from Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> yesterday in which he
                gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a
                brother medico.</p>
            <p>I am glad that you like &#38; endorse my Notes<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/> &#38; I thank you cordially for your
                kindly remarks concerning them&#8212;</p>
            <p>It may interest you to know that "the boys"<ptr target="loc.07991_n2a"/> gave me a
                "surprise party" on the evening of Dec. 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>&#8212;my
                birthday&#8212;&#38; presented me with a handsome "Literary machine"&#8212;a reading
                &#38; writing stand&#8212;bearing a brass plate engraved "To John Johnston, Esq.
                M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys of the College. Bolton, Dec. 8<hi

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02453.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>After the presentation &#38; speeches R K Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/>
                consecrated the stand by reading aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W.
                    Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/>&#8212;characterised as a Chieftan's call to
                arms&#8212;rousing us to a sense of the value &#38; importance of our little Society
                of Friends &#38; urging upon us the necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual
                manly love &#38; true Comradeship &#38; the cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest
                of the evening was spent in merriment&#8212;songs recitations &#38; social
                converse&#8212;two original humourous songs about "the Doctor" being contributed by
                W. Dixon.<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/></p>
