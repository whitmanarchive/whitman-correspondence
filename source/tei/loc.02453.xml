                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>Thanks to you for your kind p.c &amp; for your long &amp; interesting letter both of
                which I received yesterday<ptr target="n5005b"/>—</p>
            <p>I am much grieved to hear of the death of your brother Jefferson<ptr target="n4995"/>
                which must have been a heavy blow to you &amp; one which I am sure you would feel
                most acutely. On behalf of the friends here &amp; myself I desire to tender you our
                sincere &amp; heartfelt sympathy in your sore bereavement. May the Great Healer
                &amp; Consoler pour His balm into your wounded heart &amp; give you of his sweet
                Peace &amp; Comfort!</p>
            <p>I am also extremely sorry to hear of your continued indisposition &amp; I hope that
                by this time things have taken a more favourable turn with you &amp; that<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02453.002.jpg" type="verso"/> your strong faith
                &amp; your vast store of long suffering patience, indomitable pluck and hopeful
                joyousness may bear you through these "gloomy blue days" as they have done so often
                before.</p>
            <p>I received a good letter from Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> yesterday in which he
                gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a
                brother medico.</p>
            <p>I am glad that you like &amp; endorse my Notes<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/> &amp; I thank you cordially for your
                kindly remarks concerning them—</p>
            <p>It may interest you to know that "the boys"<ptr target="loc.07991_n2a"/> gave me a
                "surprise party" on the evening of Dec. 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>—my
                birthday—&amp; presented me with a handsome "Literary machine"—a reading
                &amp; writing stand—bearing a brass plate engraved "To John Johnston, Esq.
                M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys of the College. Bolton, Dec. 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi> 1890."</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02453.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>After the presentation &amp; speeches R K Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/>
                consecrated the stand by reading aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W.
                    Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/>—characterised as a Chieftan's call to
                arms—rousing us to a sense of the value &amp; importance of our little Society
                of Friends &amp; urging upon us the necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual
                manly love &amp; true Comradeship &amp; the cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest
                of the evening was spent in merriment—songs recitations &amp; social
                converse—two original humourous songs about "the Doctor" being contributed by
                W. Dixon.<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/></p>
            <p>By this mail I am sending a parcel of Christmas literature for you &amp; some of the
                other members of your household; also a copy of this week's <hi rend="underline">Bolton Journal</hi> containing a short paragraph anent a pleasant evening we

                visit to you<ptr target="loc.02496_n3"/> &amp;c, &amp; exhibited your photo &amp; those I took in America<ptr target="loc.02453_n4"/> upon a
                10 ft screen.</p>
            <p>I saw Fred. Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> last night. He sends his love &amp; his
                sympathy to you &amp; asked me to order a copy of the pocket book Edition of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi><ptr target="med.00869_n1"/> for him. His address
                is—Mr Fred. Wild, 24, Arrowsmith Terrace Bolton, Lancashire, England. &amp; I
                should be obliged if you would kindly send the book to him direct.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to you for kindly sending Mr Johnstone's<ptr target="n5001"/> copy.</p>
            <p>I shall have great pleasure in sending a copy of my Notes to each of the friends
