            <p>I received a good letter from Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> yesterday in which he
                gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a

                of Dec. 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>&#8212;my birthday&#8212;+ presented me with a
                handsome "Literary machine"&#8212;a reading + writing stand&#8212;bearing a brass
                plate engraved "To John Johnston, Esq. M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys

            <p>After the presentation + speeches R K Greenhalgh consecrated the stand by reading
                aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W. Wallace<ptr target="n6121"
                />&#8212;characterised as a Chieftan's call to arms&#8212;rousing us to a sense of
                the value + importance of our little Society of Friends + urging upon us the
                necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual manly love + true Comradeship + the
                cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest of the evening was spent in
                merriment&#8212;songs recitations + social converse&#8212;two original humourous
                songs about "the Doctor" being contributed by W. Dixon.</p>
