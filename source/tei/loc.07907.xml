            <p>Your postcard of the 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.07907_n2"/> came 
                to hand last ev'g. I was, and am, much concerned to hear such poor accounts of your health
                but a good deal relieved to find that the worst symptoms had passed off for the 
                present&#8212;hope they will stay away
                for awhile. Shall look out for Feb. N.A. Review.<ptr target="loc.02915_n3"/></p>
            <p>I have some bad news to tell you. I have been in court the last two days (all Wednesday 
                and Thursday)&#8212;an action was
                brought against me for <hi rend="underline">slander</hi> by a discharged employee 
                (a young woman) the case has gone against
                me&#8212;verdict is: "For Plantiff&#8212;Damages &#36;500." Remains to be seen what stand 
                the government will take&#8212;whether
                they will support me and how far&#8212;there <hi rend="underline">may be</hi> also 
                question of appeal. What I did &#38; said was done
                and said entirely as <hi rend="underline">Med. Supt.</hi> and my judgement and conscienece 
                still tell me (as they told me all
                along) that my action has been what it should have been
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_zs.00233.jpg" type="verso"/>
                and <hi rend="underline">must have been</hi> under all the
                circumstances&#8212;this being so I am comparatively indifferent 
                as to what
                happens as consequence. Show this to Horace,<ptr target="n4267"/> I 
                shall send you the newspapers in the case and show them to Horace too. We are 
                all well&#8212;my arm (shoulder) no longer gives me
                any pain or much annoyance.<ptr target="loc.07976_n2"/> Am comfortable, have a good appetite and feel 
                hearty&#8212;all well at house&#8212;all goes well with meter<ptr target="loc.07230_n2"/>&#8212;I am
                not uneasy but that every thing will turn out well.</p>
            <p>Dear Walt&#8212;if this bladder trouble returns and is bad will you not send for 
                young Mitchell<ptr target="n4140"/> (D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>) and take such steps for relief as
                he advises? I wish you would&#8212;I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> his advice 
                will be good and that you will obtain relief by following it</p>
