            <p>So you are back again&#8212;I heard that your folks had sent for you&#8212;How did
                you like New York &#38; your trip &#38; every thing? I got your letter &#38; was
                glad to get it&#8212;write to me again if you feel like it&#8212;I saw Bill Engle
                &#38; he told me they had sent for you, &#38; that Ed was up here in Camden in a
                store&#8212;(I have not seen Ed yet)&#8212;Van I send you a paper&#8212;read that
                story "the boy from Xenia"&#8212;it is very good&#8212;in fact there is lots of good
                reading in the little paper&#8212;I know you do not care much for reading, but I
                wish you would read more&#8212;read this paper I send any how</p>

            <p>I have had a good deal of trouble in business lately, but I guess it is going to be
                all right&#8212;I am not altogether out of the woods, but near it surely&#8212;I
                keep about as usual in health&#8212;I got a paper from Herbert&#8212;one of his
                pictures has taken a big prize, a gold medal&#8212;(probably he has wrote your folks
                all about it though)&#8212;A big fire up here last night, the Narrow Gauge Engine
                House &#38; Depot, five engines burnt, bad luck&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;Van, show this letter to your father and mother&#8212;my love to you, boy, &#38; to
                all the rest, every one&#8212;I want to come down before long&#8212;Ruth, have you
