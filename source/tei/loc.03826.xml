            <p>Thanks for your postal card,<ptr target="loc.03826_n2"/> we are always so glad when
                we come down to breakfast and find something there with your good black hand
                writing&#8212;so unlike anybody else's. As I wrote you<ptr target="loc.03826_n3"/> the books came safely to hand
                and
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00152_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                are greatly appreciated by our friends who ordered them.<ptr target="loc.03826_n4"/>
                And that splendid complete volume<ptr target="n4195"/> you sent father<ptr
                    target="n4979"/>&#8212;that is a book! You know how to get out such nice
                editions&#8212;there is no one who has nicer ones.</p>
            <p>We have just been having a party of about a dozen young people staying with us to
                help in an "opera" which we wrote and performed last Saturday. It was about
                Oxford,
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00153_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            showing how some women-students got possession of a man's college and turned the men
                out. But alas, when the women were once in they began quarreling&#8212;some wishing
                to be serious and study, &#38; some to have a good time&#8212; &#38; in the end they all
                eloped with a handsome undergraduate and the men got back their college. It was very
                amusing&#8212;my part was to dance a ballet, which I
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00154_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            did, in full ballet costume.</p>
            <p>We have had a lovely summer here all-together, with visits from lots of
                friends&#8212;each of whom has brought some interesting word with him.</p>
            <p>In a week now I go back to Oxford&#8212;to Balliol College, for my last year. It is a
                dear place. I shall hate to leave it.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>all send love</salute>
                <salute>yours affectionately</salute>
