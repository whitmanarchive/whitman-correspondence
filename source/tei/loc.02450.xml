                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Thanks to you for your kind p.c. of the 18<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst. received
                this morning, from which I am sorry to learn that you were still troubled with the
                grippe etc.</p>

            <p>The reading of your p.c. inspired me with a great longing desire to go to you + to do
                something to help you in your trouble.</p>
            <p>How I envy H. T.<ptr target="n4267"/>
                <hi rend="underline">his</hi> great privilege + wish that I could be with you as he
                is! But I am heartily<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02450.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                glad to know that he <hi rend="underline">is</hi> with you daily + I have no doubt
                that his presence is a great comfort to you.</p>


            <p>By this time you will I trust, be in possession of my printed notes and of the
                numbers of <hi rend="underline">Great Thoughts</hi> containing Edmund Mercer's
                article upon yourself.</p>
            <p>I have discovered that he is a young solicitor residing in Manchester which is 11
                miles from Bolton. I have been favoured with two letters from him in one of which he
                says:&#8212;</p>
            <p>"Since I first read any of Whitman's poems&#8212;5 years ago&#8212;I have always more
                or less admired him &amp; a profound<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02450.003.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> knowledge serves to increase that admiration . . . . . I feel to
                him just now as though he were my grandfather or an aged uncle; as though I once
                knew him but my remembrances were like an infant's."</p>
            <p>He further says that he has long cherished a desire to write to you and had at
                last&#8212;thanks to my sending <hi rend="underline">Great Thoughts</hi> to
                you&#8212;"screwed his courage to the sticking place" to do so.</p>
            <p>He seems to be a genuinely good fellow + has a deep regard for you.</p>
            <p>Thank you also for your kindness in promising to send me a copy of the Ingersoll<ptr
                    target="n0839"/> Lecture. Might I<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02450.004.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> ask you to send one also to J. W. Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> +
                I will remit the cash on receipt?</p>
            <p>We had our first fall of snow here today, + very beautiful did the outside world
                look, all robed in its white mantle of purity, glorified into dazzling splendour by
                the radiant beams of the great "silent sun."</p>
            <p>A similar occasion last year on my birthday Dec. 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                suggested the enclosed "Snow Thought"</p>
            <p>It is now a lovely moonlight night + I have just returned from a most enjoyable
                walk&#8212;a professional call&#8212;+ the tramp along the snow-caked glistening
                road + through the keen, frosty air has exhilirated me + sent the warm blood
                tingling to my finger tips.<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02450.005.jpg"
