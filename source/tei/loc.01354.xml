                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman&#8212;</salute>  
            </opener>
            <p> Thy card of the 4th greeted us on our return home from Wales last night.<ptr
                    target="loc.01354_n1"/> How I wish that it contained <hi rend="underline">really
                    good</hi> news, it is dreadful for thee to have to keep thy room so long! </p>
            <p> I am sending thee Mr. Summers'<ptr target="n4299"/> account of his delightful visit to thee. I am so
                grateful to thee for seeing him&#8212;I suppose it was my letter he presented? He is
                a curious man, with first rate <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01354.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> political ability, but extraordinarily lazy. He has been a very
                intimate friend of my husband's since their College days, but I do not know him very
                well. I often see him hovering on the outskirts of a crowd at large parties, but he
                seems too lazy to talk to anybody. If he were more energetic he could rise to be one
                of the Liberal Leaders, but he has been cursed with a comfortable income, &#38; has
                never been <hi rend="underline">forced</hi> to work. The parable of the Camel &#38; the
                Needle's Eye is not confined to the Kingdom of Heaven. </p> 
            <p> We have returned to a sea of work. Frank &#38; Sam both <pb xml:id="leaf002r"

                Liberal Convention at Birmingham&#8212;where we are to read modest papers on
                political subjects. The great event will be Mr. Gladstone's<ptr

            <p>We have all had a delightful summer together in Wales. Father's health is quite
                restored, &#38;, in spite of the loss of one eye, he is able to read &#38; drive
                &#38; follow his usual course of life. Little Ray<ptr target="loc.01354_n3"/> gets
                more enchanting every day. She can say over 50 words by this time, &#38; she is 
                beginning to take an interest in dolls. She has a perfect temper &#38; robust
                health.</p>
            <p>Please thank Mr. Gilchrist,<ptr target="n0262"/> if <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01354.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> thee sees him soon, for the paper
                he sent me. I am glad he succeeded in getting the appointment, &#38; I think the <choice>

            <p> I shall await with the greatest interest the copy of "November Boughs." Will it be
                on sale at all in England? </p>
            <p> I have an accumulation of 20 letters to write today&#8212;so I must make my first
                one short. </p>
