                <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you
                a few lines to pass for a letter,—though the Lord only knows what I shall write
                about, for I have no news to tell, &amp; nothing special to say—</p>
            <p>—I came out here on a visit to an old friend<ptr target="loc.03913_n2"/> a few days
                ago, &amp; shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week—The family, (&amp; a fine
                one they are) are at Newport for the summer—my friend, the father, goes to his
                business in Philadelphia absent all day, &amp; I am left here master of a large
                house garden, library &amp;c. with servants, horses,—a good dinner at 1 o'clock
                every day—have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it—<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00524_large.jpg" type="verso"/>It is a Quaker
                family I am very much attached to—(I believe I have mentioned them to you
                before)—all kind &amp; good—but the ones that seem most to me are the
                eldest daughter Mary (<choice><abbr>ab't</abbr>
                    <expan>about</expan>
                </choice> 21) the brightest happiest sunniest cutest young woman you ever saw, &amp;
                probably you would say upon knowing her, a new &amp; different combination of
                character from any you ever saw—&amp; one I am sure you would like—And
                then the father himself, my friend—he is in business in <choice>
                    <abbr>Phila:</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice>—he has been a great traveler in Europe, &amp; something of a
                preacher—he is a good talker—&amp; very kind—we always have a good
                long ride, from 5 to 7½ afternoons—which I enjoy very much—&amp;
                then return to supper—&amp; a couple of hours talking, reading &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Then there is all now at Newport as I said another daughter &amp; a son,<ptr target="loc.03913_n3"/> a young man—all dear friends of mine—I have
                been here quite a good deal the last year &amp; a half, when they were all
                home—but now no one but the father &amp; myself here—I wish you could
                have two or three good drives with me about here—we have a fast, strong,
                gentle young sorrel mare—first rate—the roads &amp; views are the
                finest you ever saw—&amp; now they show at their best—Yesterday (Sunday)
                afternoon &amp; evening <choice>

                drove out to a hill about an hour from here &amp; had a view over twenty miles
                towards Bethlehem,—fields &amp; farms &amp; rolling country—some
                woods—the richest tract in Pennsylvania. It was an hour before sundown. It was
                like Paradise. (It will have a good effect upon me the rest of the summer.)</p>
