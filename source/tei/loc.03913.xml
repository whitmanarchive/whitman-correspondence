                <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you
                a few lines to pass for a letter,&#8212;though the Lord only knows what I shall write
                about, for I have no news to tell, &#38; nothing special to say&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;I came out here on a visit to an old friend<ptr target="loc.03913_n2"/> a few days
                ago, &#38; shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week&#8212;The family, (&#38; a fine
                one they are) are at Newport for the summer&#8212;my friend, the father, goes to his
                business in Philadelphia absent all day, &#38; I am left here master of a large
                house garden, library &#38;c. with servants, horses,&#8212;a good dinner at 1 o'clock
                every day&#8212;have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it&#8212;<pb

                before)&#8212;all kind &#38; good&#8212;but the ones that seem most to me are the

                character from any you ever saw&#8212;&#38; one I am sure you would like&#8212;And

                long ride, from 5 to 7&#189; afternoons&#8212;which I enjoy very much&#8212;&#38;
                then return to supper&#8212;&#38; a couple of hours talking, reading &#38;c.</p>
