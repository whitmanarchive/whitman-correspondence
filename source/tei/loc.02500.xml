            <p>I now take up the thread of my narrative about Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>
                &amp; his doings amongst us<ptr target="loc.02500_n2"/> at the point where I left off in my last letter<ptr target="loc.02500_n3"/></p>
            <p><date when="1891-07-19">Sunday morning (July 19th)</date> he stayed indoors resting, reading &amp; writing letters. 
                After dinner the Dr, W Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> &amp; I took train out to
                    Wallace's<ptr target="n6121"/> place where we spent the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>It was a grand afternoon&#8212;cool &amp; pleasant (after a wet morning) &amp; with
                some <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02500.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> magnificent
                cloud effects.</p> 
            <p>After a talk in the house we strolled out through the field &amp; lanes of beautiful
                Rivington &amp; enjoyed the sight &amp; show of that rural paradise &amp; the
                sweet converse of friend with friend, returning, with JW Thompson,<ptr
                    target="n5001"/> to Anderton where we all had tea (&#8212;bread &amp; butter,
                nice fresh country eggs &amp; delicious strawberries &amp; cream&#8212;)</p>
            <p>I had to leave early but the rest stayed there till 9 pm when they came on here &amp;
                were joined by Fred Wild,<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> RK Greenhalgh,<ptr
                    target="loc.02465_n5"/> Tho<hi rend="underline">s</hi>

                Shorrock<ptr target="loc.02448_n8"/> &#38; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Dixon<ptr target="loc.02500_n4"/> and W. Gass<ptr target="n5001"/>&#8212;another friend but not 
                of the inner circle who gave us a Lancashire
                reading&#8212;&amp; we talked &amp; joked&#8212;where Fred is there do jokes
                abound&#8212;till bedtime&#8212;</p>
            <p>On Monday morning the first event was the arrival of letters from you<ptr target="loc.02500_n6"/> &amp; from
                H.LT.<ptr target="n4267"/> which were heartily welcomed &amp; eagerly
                read&#8212;the more so because they contained what was on the whole good news of you</p>
            <p>After breakfast the Dr, J.W.W. &amp; I drove in my phaeton round the town visiting the Town Hall where
                    T. Shorrock accompanied us
                through the really very <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02500.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> fine building as I think the Dr. will tell you.</p>
            <p>At 11.20 a.m we saw him off to London &amp; I have not yet heard from him.</p>
            <p>On his return journey he will probably stay with Wallace for a day or two</p>
            <p>I need not tell you how much we have all enjoyed the Dr's visit, how much we like and
                appreciate him for his cordiality &amp; <hi rend="underline">bonhommie</hi> &amp;
                what extremely pleasant impressions he has left behind him in Bolton.</p>
            <p>We feel, too, that his visit has done us good <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.02500.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> It has seemed to bring you nearer
                &amp; it has certainly made you dearer than ever to us.</p>
            <p>Nay more to some of us it has almost seemed as if you yourself <hi rend="underline"
                    >had</hi> been here; for the resemblance between the Dr &amp; you was remarked
                upon&#8212;Fred told him that if ever you wanted to have your photograph taken and
                couldn't go you might send the Dr! And then Dr B told us the story about the Camden Hackman who asked him where
                he was to drive <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02500.006_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> to&#8212;"Oh," said the Dr, "<hi rend="underline">you</hi> know well
                enough."</p> 
            <p>"All right sir" said the man "I suppose you want to go to your <hi
                    rend="underline">brother's!</hi>"</p>
            <p>He very kindly <hi rend="underline">gave</hi> us your letter to him in which you
                referred to us in such high terms&#8212;I could see that it cost him a wrench to
                part with it &amp; he did so because he "felt to" &amp; thought it would please us;
                but of course we are to let him have a copy of it.</p>
            <p>We are indeed pleased to have it &amp; we shall prize it very
                highly indeed as another token of your <pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc.02500.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> affectionate regard for us for
                which we desire to thank you most cordially.</p>
            <p>I regret to hear from yr letter that you were suffering from "lassitude &amp;
                headache"<ptr target="loc.02500_n5"/> &amp; trust that they were only temporary. &amp; that you are now keeping better, on the whole.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to you for promising me a copy of the tomb<ptr target="loc.07329_n5b"/> picture.</p>
            <p>Dr B has of course told us a good deal about the tomb amongst other things. But <hi
                    rend="underline">you are not going there</hi> yet awhile, dear old friend! <pb
                    xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02500.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> We cant spare
                you yet. For what should we do without you?&#8212;and Wallace has to see you yet! No
                No! Granite &amp; marble edifice! You must be content to be tenantless for a very long time yet!</p>
            <p>Forgive my seeming levity. Upon such a <hi rend="underline">grave</hi> subject.</p>
            <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="horbar-full"/>
            <p>We have had a good deal of rain here this week wh is bad for the hay crop.</p>
