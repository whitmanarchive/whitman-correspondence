                <salute>Dear Mr Whitman</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Please pardon my intrusion but as I am a great lover of literature especially poetry,
                I have always taken great interest in you and your poems and other writings and am a
                great admirer of them,</p>
            <p>I have often looked for your photograph but have never succeeded in obtaining one and
                have no definite idea of your features. I have been much disappointed in not
                securing your photograph and concluded that, perhaps, I could procure one of you 
                Have you a photograph of yourself which you could send me?</p>
            <p>I enclose you 25&#162; for photograph if you have one which you are willing to send to me.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01979.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I shall anxiously await your reply and hope that you will be so kind as to send a
                photograph I have long desired your opinion on several matters in literature but
                will only ask you one.</p>
            <p>I have read and studied Mr. Joaquin Miller's<ptr target="n0412"/> poems "<choice><sic>Songe</sic><corr>Songs</corr></choice> of the Sierras" 
                and have been greatly impressed by them.<ptr target="loc.01979_n4"/> I am very curious
                to learn your opinion of him, and his poems. I shall be greatly indebted to you if
                you will give me an opinion of Mr. Miller's muse
                If you will be so kind as to answer my critical questions I will thank you very much.</p>
            <p>Will you if you are not occupied please write me with your own hand a copy of one of
                your poems? I do not wish to be a nuisance and a bore to you and if you have not plenty of
                leisure 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01979.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                I will not ask you for the poem I have poems in the handwriting of Bryant,<ptr target="med.00858_n15"/> 
                Longfellow,<ptr target="n0367"/> Holmes<ptr target="loc.04995_n1"/> and Whittier<ptr target="n1029"/> 
                and with yours if you send it I will complete the series of the 
                <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> American poets. If you do not wish to answer I
                will not be greatly surprised for I presume you are nearly bored to death by
                "<hi rend="underline">autograph fiends</hi>" but I write you as a lover of literature and am not to be
                classed with the "fiends" in any sense.</p>
            <p>With best wishes for your health and prosperity</p>
