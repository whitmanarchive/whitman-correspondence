            <p>I supposed you rec'd a paper from me lately with an acc't of some of my movements &#38;c. here, as I sent you one&#8212;I had no idea of staying so long when I left 13th June&#8212;thought only of staying a couple of days&#8212;[but then?] it will be most a month soon&#8212;But I shall return to Camden next Tuesday&#8212;or Wednesday at furthest&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I keep well &#38; hearty considering&#8212;it has been very hot weather here for a week, but I havn't minded it any to hurt&#8212;to-day it has been a little more moderate&#8212;I have been down this forenoon to Sarony's,<ptr target="nyp.00407_n2"/> the great photographic establishment, where I was invited to come &#38; sit for my picture&#8212;had a real pleasant time&#8212;I will bring you on one of the pictures&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>My darling boy, I want to see you very much, &#38; I know you do me too&#8212;Harry, I meet many, many friends here, some very fine folks&#8212;some tip-top young men too&#8212;&#38; there is no end to hospitality, &#38; places to visit &#38;c.&#8212;everybody seems to know me&#8212;it is quite funny sometimes&#8212;but I believe I am as contented down by the old pond as any where&#8212;(I wish I was there this afternoon&#8212;at least for a couple of hours)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Well, I see Hunter<ptr target="nyp.00407_n3"/> was convicted&#8212;we will see now whether he is hung&#8212;I see an item in the paper that [Emma?] Bethel had confessed to poisoning the Bishops&#8212;I will finish my letter &#38; send it off to-morrow&#8212;</p>
            
            <p><date when="1878-07-07"><hi rend="italic">Sunday July 7</hi></date>&#8212;The little 15 months old baby, little Harry (that was born that night there in 10th street,) is a fine, good bright child, not very rugged, but gets along very well&#8212;I take him in my arms always after breakfast &#38; go out in front for a short walk&#8212;he is very contented &#38; good with me&#8212;little Kitty<ptr target="nyp.00407_n4"/> goes too&#8212;I had a good night's rest last night, &#38; am feeling comfortable to-day&#8212;Good bye for the present, my loving son&#8212;It will not be long now before we are together again&#8212;</p>
