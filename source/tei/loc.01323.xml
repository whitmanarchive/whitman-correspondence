                <salute>My dear Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have been voyaging amid the Hebrides,&#8212;strolling amid the
                Highlands,&#8212;loafing by the Sea,&#8212;trying to extract from two or three
                weeks' vacation some <choice>
                    <orig>vigour</orig>
                    <reg>vigor</reg>
                </choice> and virtue for my work, which in these last years grows heavy. On
                returning I found your munificence to be as of old. The three volumes, and the
                photographs were most welcome. A third photograph was sent to me by Sharman.<ptr
                    target="n0556"/> (If you see him tell him that his accompanying letter got lost
                in my absence or it <choice>

                    <expan>should</expan>
                </choice> have been answered.)</p>
            <p>About the same time that I received your volumes I got a letter from Kate
                Hillard,<ptr target="loc.01323_n2"/> (a brilliant girl and writer of Brooklyn who was
                here last year) written <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01323.002_large.jpg"

                Adirondacks. She says:&#8212;"I have made a discovery since I have been here, and
                that is, that I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I
                fancied I enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the
                only one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
                continue beyond. The others seem more or less paltry and insufficient, except
                    Shakespeare,<ptr target="med.00858_n4"/> and he seems almost too courtly. But
                Walt Whitman exactly accords with the ruggedness and tenderness of the mountains,
                and seems in some way more their fellow. At any rate he so affects me, and what
                other thing can we know?"</p>

            <p>I copy this for you as it is in a way what the mountains said about you to the
                girl.</p> 
            <p>As you may judge, the criticism in the Westminster Review<ptr target="n0692"/> seemed
                to me valuable on account of its stand-point and main principles. The <choice>

                of a pleasing volume of Poems) submitted to me recently a very long and careful
                review of your work, which begins with a charmingly incisive analysis of the
                Saturday Reviews<ptr target="loc.01317_n2"/> criticism. The Essay of Noel will probably
                appear in the new Oxonian magazine "The Dark Blue."<ptr target="n0181"/> I shall
