                <salute>My dear Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have been voyaging amid the Hebrides,&#8212;strolling amid the
                Highlands,&#8212;loafing by the sea,&#8212;trying to extract from two or three
                weeks' vacation some <choice>
                    <orig>vigour</orig>
                    <reg>vigor</reg>
                </choice> and virtue for my work, which in these last years grows heavy. On
                returning I found your munificence to be as of old. The three volumes, and the
                photographs were most welcome. A third photograph was sent to me by Sharman<!-- <ptr target="n0556"/> -->. (If you see him tell him that his accompanying letter got lost
                in my absence or it <choice>
                    <abbr>shd</abbr>
                    <expan>should</expan>
                </choice> have been answered.)</p>

            <p>About the same time that I received your volumes I got a letter from Kate Hillard<!-- <ptr target="n0302"/> -->, (a brilliant girl and writer of Brooklyn who was here last
                year) written <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01323.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01323.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01323.004.jpg" type="verso"/> from the Adirondacks.
                She says:&#8212;"I have made a discovery since I have been here, and that is, that I
                never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed
                it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
                reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue beyond. The
                others seem more or less paltry and insufficient, except Shakespeare, and he seems
                almost too courtly. But Walt Whitman exactly accords with the ruggedness and
                tenderness of the mountains, and seems in some way more their fellow. At any rate he
                so affects me, and what other thing can we know?"</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01323.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>2d that.</p>
            <p>I copy this for you as it is in a way what the mountains said about you to the
                girl.</p>
            <p> As you may judge, the criticism in the Westminster Review<!-- <ptr target="n0692"/> --> seemed to me valuable on
                account of its stand-point and main principles. The <choice>
                    <abbr>Hon</abbr>
                    <expan>Honorable</expan>
                </choice> Roden Noel<!-- <ptr target="n0446"/> --> (one of the Lord Byron blood, and author
                of a pleasing volume of Poems) submitted to me recently a very long and careful
                review of your work, which begins with a charmingly incisive analysis of the
                Saturday Review's<!-- <ptr target="n0539"/> --> criticism. The essay of Noel will probably
                appear in the new Oxonian magazine "The Dark Blue."<!-- <ptr target="n0181"/> --> I shall
                take care to send it to you.</p>
            <p>What is this I hear of your coming over here? Is it to be so?&#8212;and if so, when?
                and for how long? When you arrive&#8212;if that <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01323.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01323.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01323.008.jpg" type="verso"/> good fortune awaits
                us&#8212;you must (letting me know beforehand the ship by which you sail from
                America) come straight to my house, where you will find a small room but a large
                welcome. I hear that Tennyson<!-- <ptr target="n0625"/> --> has written to you, and should be
                very glad to know what he said.</p>
            <p>Let me hear from you so soon as you find it convenient.</p>
