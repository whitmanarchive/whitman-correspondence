            <p>As one of the College Boys<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/> who feels honored by the

                to our beloved master &#38; representative Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/>
                on his recent visit to you,<ptr target="loc.04400_n2b"/> &#38; who is grateful for the kind messages of love which
                you have so frequently sent to us, I wish to send you a word to convey my deepest sympathy
                for you in your long trying &#38; painful illness. The latest 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01476.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                accounts of your condition have been read at our meetings &#38; we have all been affected
                by your terrible sufferings.<ptr target="loc.02538_n4b"/> You are daily in our thoughts &#38; it is very pleasing to 
                know that notwithstanding your sickness thoughts of your Bolton friends are entertained
                by you &#38; that we are so dear to you that though so deadly weak you have yet striven
                to send us a word of goodwill written by your own hand. I (&#38; the others I am sure) 
                feel very grateful for the act. &#38; I return my best thanks.

                had the letter<ptr target="loc.01476_n1"/> facsimiled &#38;
                has kindly sent me a copy this morning with a printed extract from Traubel's letter
                relating to it &#38; you. No doubt you will get copies sent to you. It is gratifying
                to know that in your fearful sufferings you still preserve your good stout heart &#38; 
                manly affections May these continue to support &#38; cheer you. A life so well spent
                &#38; sickness so bravely borne will not be lost on the world but will be quoted to 
                this &#38; future
