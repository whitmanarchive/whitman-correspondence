                </salute>
            </opener>
            <p> Your card<ptr target="loc.05767_n2"/> (your very voice &amp; touch, drawing me
                across the Atlantic close beside you) was put into my hand just as I was busy
                copying out "With husky, haughty lips O sea" to pin into my "Leaves of Grass." I
                hardly think there is anything grander there. I think surely they must see that that
                is the very Soul of Nature uttering itself sublimely. </p> 
            <p> Who do you think came to see us on Sunday? Professor Dowden.<ptr
                    target="loc.05767_n1"/> And I know not when I have set eyes on a more beautiful
                personality. I think you would be as much attracted towards him as I was. It was he
                who told me (full of enthusiasm) of the Poems in <hi rend="italic">Harper's</hi> which I had not seen or
                heard of.<ptr target="loc.05767_n3"/> We had a very happy two or three hours together, talking of you &amp;
                looking through Blake's drawings. He is a tall man, complexion tanned &amp; healthy,
                nose finely modelled, dark eyes with plenty of life &amp; meaning in them, hair
                grayish&#8212;I should think he was between forty &amp; fifty&#8212;but says his
                father is still a fine hale old man. </p>
            <p> Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> disappointed again this year of getting anything into the
                R. Academy. </p>
            <p> I think I like the idea of the shanty, if you have any one to take good care of you,
                to cook nicely, keep all neat &amp; clean &amp;c. I wonder if I have ever been in
                Mickle St. I, still busy, still hammering away to see if I can help those that
                "balk" at "Leaves of Grass". Perhaps you will smile at me&#8212;at any rate it bears
                good fruit to me&#8212;I seem to be in a manner living with you the while. </p>
            <p> Everything full of beauty just now here, as no doubt it is with you. </p>
            <p> Good-bye, dearest friend&#8212;don't forget the letter that is to come soon. Love
                from us all, love &amp; again love from </p>
