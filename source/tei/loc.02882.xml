                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Since last I wrote to you at the beginning of April (enclosing a little photograph of
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">the old</supplied>
                avenue just by our cottage at Colne) I have been into Wales for a fortnight to see
                    Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02882_n1"/> --> &amp; have looked for the first time in my
                life, on the Atlantic&#8212;the ocean my mental eyes travel over &amp; beyond so
                often, and that your eyes and ears &amp; heart have been fed by, have communed with
                and interpreted, as in a new tongue to the soul of man. Looking upon that, watching
                the tides ebb &amp; flow, that ebb &amp; flow on your shores, sharing, through my
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02882.002.jpg" type="verso"/> beloved book, in
                those greatest moments you have spent alone with it&#8212;that was a new joyful
                experience, a fresh kind of communing with you.&#8212;I went to Wales because I felt
                anxious about Percy, who is not happy just now. I must not tell friends here about
                it (except his brother &amp; sisters but I am sure I may tell you, for you will
                listen with sympathy. <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">He
                    has attached</supplied> himself very <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">deeply, I think it will prove, to a</supplied>
                girl, &amp; she to him whose parents <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">welcomed</supplied> him cordially to their
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">house for</supplied>
                a year or two &amp; allowed <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">plenty</supplied> of intercourse till they became
                aware, through Percy himself who thought it right <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02882.003.jpg" type="recto"/> to tell the father as soon as he was
                fully aware of his own feelings &amp; more than suspected Norah's response to them)
                that there was a strong affection growing up between the two. Then they peremptorily <choice>
                    <sic>forbad</sic>
                    <corr>forbade</corr>
                </choice> all intercourse,&#8212;not because they have any objection to
                Percy&#8212;quite the contrary they say; but solely and simply because he is not yet
                earning money enough to marry on, &amp; they hold that a man has no right to engage
                a girl's affections till he can do so. As if these things could be timed to the
                moment the money comes in! Percy <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02882.004.jpg" type="verso"/> was in hopes, &amp; so was I, that if I went down, I might get
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">sense</supplied>
                enough into their heads, if not kindness &amp; sympathy into their hearts, to see
                that the sole effect of such arbitrary &amp; narrow sighted conduct would be to
                alienate &amp; embitter the young people's feelings toward them, while it would make
                them more restless &amp; anxious to marry without adequate means. Whereas if a
                reasonable amount of intercourse were allowed, it would be a happy time with them,
                &amp; Norah <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">being</supplied> still so young, (18), &amp; Percy,&#8212; <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02882.005.jpg" type="recto"/> working away with all
                his might, doing very well for his age &amp; sure, conscientious thorough capable
                &amp; well trained worker that he is (for the L. School of Mais gives a first rate
                scientific preparation for his profession) to be making a modest sufficiency in a
                year or two. Well, they were very courteous &amp; indeed friendly to me &amp; I
                think I have won <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">over</supplied> the mother but the father remains obdurate, &amp; Percy feels
                bitterly the <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02882.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                separation&#8212;all the more trying as they live almost within sight of each other.
                So Beatrice<!-- <ptr target="loc.02882_n2"/> --> &amp;
                    Grace<!-- <ptr target="loc.02882_n3"/> --> are going to spend their holidays with him this summer to cheer
                him up. Meanwhile, dear friend, I am on the whole happier than not about him. I
                liked what I saw of Norah &amp; believe he has found a very sweet affectionate girl
                of <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">quiet,
                    domestic</supplied> nature, practical&#8212; industrious
                sensible&#8212;thoroughly well to suit him, &amp; that there is true &amp; deep love
                between them&#8212;also she took to me very much &amp; I feel will be quite another
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02882.007.jpg" type="recto"/> child to me. It is
                besides no little joy to me to find how Percy has confided in me in this &amp;
                chooses me as the friend to whom he tells all&#8212; far from <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">being</supplied> any separation
                as sometimes happens this love of his seems to draw us closer together. Only I am
                very, very anxious for his sake to see him in a better berth&#8212; they would let
                her marry him on £300 a year; now he has only £175. He is quite competent
                to manage iron or copper or tin works, only he looks so young, not having yet any
                beard or moustache to speak of. That is the end of my long story.</p>
