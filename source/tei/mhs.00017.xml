            <p>I have been quite unwell, a bad spell with my head, worse than usual, nine or ten
                days—I kept up, but had no comfort—the last two days it is easier, &amp;
                it is passing over apparently, for the present<ptr target="mhs.00017_n1"/>—</p>

            <p>—Lou I think I would like to have you or George put up my letters (not the books or
                papers) in a package, &amp; send them to me here, 2316 Pine street,—if it <choice>
                    <sic>dont</sic>
                    <corr>don't</corr>
                </choice> make too big a package, <hi rend="underline">send by mail</hi>, (postage will
                be 6 cts an ounce by mail)—(or if George thinks best, send by
                express—that is if the parcel is too big)—please do it soon as
                convenient—there is <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="mhs.00017.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>brown wrapping-paper &amp; string in my room—I shall stay
                here perhaps two weeks longer—It is very hot here for this season, indeed as
                hot as we had it in July there in Camden—I go out most every day, Jeff has
                taken me out riding very often, &amp; I have been everywhere within several miles,
                &amp; in all the outer parts of the City which are the roomiest &amp; the
                pleasantest by far of any city I have ever seen—Jeff is very kind indeed,
                &amp; I am agreeably fixed here—&amp; since I am here so far, &amp; shall
                probably never come again, I have concluded to stay awhile—The girls are well
                &amp; hearty &amp; send their love—Hatty is down <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="mhs.00017.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>stairs piano-practising as I
                write—I have not written any thing for publication yet here, as I have not
                felt well, but I want to, before I leave, as this trip is a great revelation,
                especially the Colorado journey, &amp; the mountains—</p>

            <p>—Lou your letter was <choice>
                    <abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice>, &amp; very glad to get it—Write again soon after receiving
                this—I have written to Hannah<ptr target="mhs.00017_n2"/> and Mary<ptr target="mhs.00017_n3"/> from here—I have just written to the Camden post
                office to send my letters on here for the present—Lou this is a wonderful,
                wonderful country, &amp; the richest city <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="mhs.00017.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>upon the whole (thousands and
                thousands of fine comfortable 5 or $6000 well built brick or stone houses, with
                gardens around them) &amp; streets ahead of Chestnut st<ptr target="mhs.00017_n4"/>
                &amp; more crowded, &amp;c &amp;c—but there are just <hi rend="underline">two things</hi> here you &amp;

                    <expan>would</expan>
                </choice> never get used to, &amp; would spoil all,—that is the air you breathe is
                always tainted with coal smoke &amp; pungent gas—&amp; a perpetual dust &amp;
                smut &amp; little black motes, that forever smut your clothes &amp; hands &amp;
                face, all the time, night &amp; day—So you see there are always some bad
                points, even to the greatest &amp; best—But the folks here don't seem to mind
                it, or think it is any thing<ptr target="mhs.00017_n5"/>—</p>
