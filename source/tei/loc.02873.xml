            <p>The papers with Prof: Young's<ptr target="loc.02873_n1"/> speech came safely, &amp; I 
                read it, my hand in yours&#8212;happy and full of interest.&#8212;Are you getting on 
                my Darling? When I know that you no longer suffer from distressing sensations in the 
                head &amp; can move without such effort and difficulty a hymn of thankfulness will go 
                up from my heart.<ptr target="loc.03649_n3"/> Perhaps this week I shall 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.00224.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                get the paper with the line on it that is to tell me so much&#8212;or at least that you 
                are well on your way towards it.<ptr target="loc.02873_n4"/>&#8212;And what shall I tell 
                you about? The quiet tenor 
                of our daily lives here? but that is very restricted, though I trust as far as it goes, 
                good &amp; healthful. Or the thoughts and hopes that leap forward across the ocean &amp; 
                the years? But they hide themselves away when I want to put them into words. Do not think 
                I live in dreams. I know very well it is strictly in 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00225.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                proportion as the present &amp; the past have been busy shaping &amp; preparing the 
                materials of a beautiful future, that it really will be beautiful when it comes to 
                exist as a present, seeing how it needs must be entirely a growth from all that has 
                preceded it &amp; that there are no sudden creations of flowers of happiness in men 
                &amp; women any more than in the fields. But if the buds lie ready 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00222.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                folded ah what the sunshine will do! What fills me with such deep joy in your poems 
                is the sense of the large complete acceptiveness&#8212;the full &amp; perfect faith 
                in humanity&#8212;<hi rend="underline">in every individual unit of humanity</hi> thus 
                for the first time uttered. That alone satisfies the sense of justice in the soul, 
                responds to what its own nature compels it to believe of the Infinite Source of all. 
                That too includes within its scope the lot as well 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_cb.00228.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                as the man. His infinite undying self must achieve and 
                <choice><orig>fulfil</orig><reg>fulfill</reg></choice> itself out of any &amp; 
                all experiences. Why if it takes such ages &amp; such vicissitudes to compact a bit 
                of rock&#8212;fierce heat, &amp; icy cold storms deluges, crushing pressure &amp; 
                slow subsidences as if it were likely a handful of years &amp; all sunshine would do 
                for a man!&#8212;</p>

            <p>The longed for paper has come to hand. O it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a

                slow struggle back to health my Darling! I believe in the main it is good news that is 
                come&#8212;and there is the little stroke I wanted so on the address. But for all that 
                I feel troubled &amp; anxious&#8212;for I believe you have been a great deal worse since 
                you wrote&#8212;and that you have still such a steep steep hill to climb. Perhaps if my 
                hand were in yours dear Walt, you would get 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_cb.00231.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                along faster&#8212;Dearer and sweeter that lot than even to have been your bride in the 
                full flush &amp; strength and glory of your youth. I turn my 
                face to the westward sky before I lie down to sleep, deep &amp; steadfast within me the 
                silent aspiration that every year, every month &amp; week may help something to prepare 
                and make fitter me and mine to be your comfort and joy. We are full of imperfections 
                shortcomings, but half developed, but 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_cb.00227.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                half "possessing our own souls." But we grow, we learn we strive&#8212;that is the 
                best of us. I think in the sunshine of your presence we shall grow fast I too, my years 
                notwithstanding&#8212;May the New Year lead you out into the sunshine again&#8212;shed of
                out of its days health &amp; strength so that you tread the earth in gladness again. 
                This, with love from us all.</p>
