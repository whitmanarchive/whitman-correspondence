                the great separating waters of the Atlantic. Our Alys<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/>
                will have before this seen you, I trust, and given us a picture of how you fare in
                these days. Having got through the murderous heats of the Camden summer, I greatly
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00214_large.jpg" type="verso"/> hope that you
                will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now &amp; then in
                your wilderness of books &amp; papers! With much to bring pleasure to you from far
                &amp; near—the hearty tribute of reverence and affection from those whose
                lives you have helped to illuminate &amp; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed
                with it physical &amp; mental heart sinkings when the unsolved, unsolveable problems
                of sin, pain, sorrow &amp; the unrevealed future <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00215_large.jpg" type="recto"/> must press upon spirits more or

                &amp; next our own, knows not one half the reasons why we smile or sigh"—and down in the depths of unrevealable consciousness, the problems are
                fought out—alas! with what small results of certitude. Not a few of us have
                met great audiences with bold words while the depths of purgatory were being stirred
                up within us!</p>

            <p>Well, dear Comrade, we are helpless—we must go on with the deepest problems
                unsolved, &amp; face pain, grief, loneliness, death bravely as we can. From the

                &amp; work as though I had a century before me. </p>
            <p>You have many, many friends among the young &amp; earnest in whose unsoiled vigorous

            <p>In our country home at Haslemere—close, by the way, to Tennysons<ptr target="n0625"/> home—are many highly cultivated people who love you. Alys
                will tell you how like paradise our home there is—and how often we have wished
                that we might have you there to drive around the beautiful hills, two thirds in
                woods &amp; undergrowth for miles. I had hoped to guide you across the ocean, 
                but I fear that we may not now hope for that.</p>
