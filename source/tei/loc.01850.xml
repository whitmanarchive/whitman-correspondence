            <p>Received your card of Dec 12<ptr target="n5002c"/> at <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="low">proper</unclear> time I see a remarkably favorable notice of your 
                friend <hi rend="underline">Conway</hi><ptr target="n0170"/> by a female correspondent of a Nashville paper. 
                Why not tell me of <hi rend="underline">your pleasure from his visit &amp;c &amp;c</hi>? 
                I have been thinking a long time about sending you some scraps of printed matter&#8212;among them some 
                written by a Dr (M.D.) F.O. Ticknor of (Columbus) Georgia.<ptr target="loc.01850_n3"/> He was a poetical or at least 
                fanciful writer in both verse and prose form fully as much so in prose as in verse. He was a 
                <hi rend="underline">brisk</hi> or piquant and pleasing scribbler yet an <hi rend="underline">extremist</hi> 
                and decidedly a <hi rend="underline">failure</hi> as a <hi rend="underline">philosopher</hi>. He died a year
                or so ago. I have not read much of what he wrote after the beginning of the war. (After getting from you
                John Burroughs'<ptr target="n0129"/> picture, I sent him in latter part of June '75 a short note and some
                scraps of Ticknor's <hi rend="underline">fanciful</hi> writing about fruit-culture&#8212;directed to Esopus 
                New York, his letter to you being thus Esopus West Park NY found ano West Park in P.O. Directory</p>           
            <p>I got no notice of its receipt by him, which was quite a disappointment, as I would have been glad for him to have Ticknor's pieces.</p>
            <p>I have wanted you to see a notice in the N.Y. Weekly Sun of Dec 8 last of Joaquin

                his first volume and scraps occasionally, <hi rend="underline">I</hi> call him &#9755; a Poet "by the skin of
                his teeth"&#8212;have done so for near two years&#8212;he writes <hi rend="underline">some</hi> pretty passages.</p>           
            <p>Have you ever read Weems' Life of Washington?<ptr target="loc.01850_n2"/>&#8212;written for children but
                really best suited for "pert" men&#8212;I have <hi rend="underline">bragged on</hi> it for twenty years.</p>

            <p>You have doubtless read so much about <hi rend="underline">everything</hi> that I would like an opportunity to
                ask you a question or more on Intellectual or Moral Philosophy. Do all writers who deny Free Will and yet 
                wish to find <hi rend="underline">room for blame</hi>, make the same <hi rend="underline">ridiculous blunder</hi>
                that is made by <hi rend="underline">Abercrombie</hi><ptr target="loc.01850_n4"/> in his Int. Phil. 
                for Schools? he says we may blame a man to-day (<choice><abbr>tho'</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> 
                not free) because in time past (when <hi rend="underline">feeling</hi> himself free &#9755; 
                <choice><abbr>tho'</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> not so &#9754;) he did wrong repeatedly and brought
                himself to be of such a character that <hi rend="underline">right motives</hi> can't have their 
                proper effect. Absurd, Absurd, &amp;c &amp;c "All is <hi rend="underline">truth</hi> without exception".<ptr target="loc.01850_n5"/></p>
            <p>About ten months ago a Presiding Elder<ptr target="n5001"/> of the Methodist church, after "talking around the edges" (as I called it)
                of the <hi rend="underline">great question</hi> (Religion), and being much surprised and a little frightened 
                (doubtless) by the quiet strength and yet charitable tenderness of the philosopher, admitted the latter was 
                perfectly <hi rend="underline">sane</hi>, and "yet there must be <hi rend="underline">a screw loose somewhere</hi>.
                Walt! do you think there is "a screw loose somewhere" in all advocates of Orthodoxy? I know there is with many, 
                and it is thus&#8212;their <hi rend="underline">conceit</hi> enables them to hope <hi rend="underline">they</hi> 
                will escape "the wrath to come" and with that weak <hi rend="underline">moral sense</hi> that will "always praise
                the bridge that passes <hi rend="underline">me</hi> over safely," they are satisfied. 
                If you encourage me to write, and say you will sometimes <hi rend="underline">write to me</hi> I will buy
                <hi rend="underline">me some pens</hi>&#8212;one of my curious ways I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice>
                write much to anybody but you ("What! bestow all thy tediousness on me?")</p>
