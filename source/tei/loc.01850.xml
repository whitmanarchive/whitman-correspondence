            <p>Received your card of Dec 12 at <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">prayer</unclear> time<!-- Or "term?" -JS --> I <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">saw</unclear> a remarkably favorable notice of your friend <hi rend="underline">Conway</hi> by a female correspondent of a Nashville paper. Why not tell me of <hi rend="underline">your pleasure from his visit &amp;c &amp;c</hi>? I have been thinking a long time about sending you some scraps of printed matter&#8212;among them some written by a Dr (M.D.) F.O. Ticknor of (<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">Columbus</unclear>) Georgia. He was a poetical or at least fanciful writer in both verse and prose form fully as much so in prose as in verse. He was a <hi rend="underline">brisk</hi> or piquant and pleasing scribbler yet an <hi rend="underline">extremist</hi> and decidedly a <hi rend="underline">failure</hi> as a <hi rend="underline">philosopher</hi>. He died a year or so ago. I have not read much of what he wrote after the beginning of the war. (After getting from you John Burroughs' picture, I sent him in latter part of June '75 a short note and some scraps of Ticknor's <hi rend="underline">fanciful</hi> writing about fruit-culture&#8212;directed to Esopus New York, his letter to you being <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">this</unclear> Esopus West Park NY found no West Park in P.O. Directory</p>
            
            <p>I got no notice of its receipt by him, which was quite a disappointment, as I would have been glad for him to have Ticknor's pieces.</p>
            <p>I have wanted you to see a notice in the N.Y. Weekly Sun of Dec 8 last of Joaquin <choice><sic>Millers</sic><corr>Miller's</corr></choice> last volume&#8212;I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> doubt it was just&#8212;from reading his first volume and scraps occasionally, <hi rend="underline">I</hi> call him ☞ a Poet "by the skin of his teeth"&#8212;have done so for near two years&#8212;he writes <hi rend="underline">some</hi> pretty passages.</p>
            
            <p>Have you ever read Weems' Life of Washington?&#8212;written for children but really best suited for "pert" men&#8212;I have <hi rend="underline">bragged on</hi> it for twenty years.</p>

            <p>You have doubtless read so much about <hi rend="underline">everything</hi> that I would like an opportunity to ask you a question or more on Intellectual or Moral Philosophy. Do all writers who deny Free Will and yet wish to find <hi rend="underline">room for blame</hi>, make the same <hi rend="underline">ridiculous blunder</hi> that is made by <hi rend="underline">Abercrombie</hi> in his Int. Phil. for Schools? he says we may blame a man to-day (<choice><orig>tho'</orig><reg>though</reg></choice> not free) because in time past (when <hi rend="underline">feeling</hi> himself free ☞ <choice><orig>tho'</orig><reg>though</reg></choice> not so ☜) he did wrong repeatedly and brought himself to be of such a character that <hi rend="underline">right motives</hi> can't have their proper effect. Absurd, Absurd, &amp;c &amp;c "All is <hi rend="underline">truth</hi> without exception".</p>
            <p>About ten months ago a Presiding Elder of the Methodist church, after "talking around the edges" (as I called it) of the <hi rend="underline">great question</hi> (Religion), and being much surprised and a little frightened (doubtless) by the quiet strength and yet charitable tenderness of the philosopher, admitted the latter was perfectly <hi rend="underline">sane</hi>, and "yet there must be <hi rend="underline">a screw loose somewhere</hi>. Walt! do you think there is "a screw loose somewhere" in all advocates of Orthodoxy? I know there is with many, and it is thus&#8212;their <hi rend="underline">conceit</hi> enables them to hope <hi rend="underline">they</hi> will escape "the wrath to come" and with that weak <hi rend="underline">moral sense</hi> that will "always praise the bridge that passes <hi rend="underline">me</hi> over safely," they <hi rend="underline">are</hi> satisfied. If you encourage me to write, and say you will sometimes <hi rend="underline">write to me</hi> I will buy <hi rend="underline">me some pens</hi>&#8212;one of my <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">curious</unclear> ways I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> write much to anybody but you (What! bestow all they tediousness on me?") </p>
