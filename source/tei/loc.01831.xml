            <p>Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of 17th &amp; we have had quite a talk &#8212;he seems to be a wide‑awake, candid young man, &amp; makes a good impression upon me.  He spoke of you, of his own affairs &amp; fortunes, of Idaho, of Judge Kelly Holbrook, &amp;c. &amp;c.&#8212;In

            respect to Judge Kelly, &amp; his matter, I had already formed my opinion &amp; made out my Report several days ago&#8212;The Attorney General is full of anxiety &amp; debate, on the big things that are up, just now, &#8212;&amp; has not been able to hear the Report, &amp; decide upon it&#8212;but he told me this morning he would try to do so very shortly&#8212;If he decides as I have advised him, you &amp; Cummins will have no reason to be dissatisfied.</p>
