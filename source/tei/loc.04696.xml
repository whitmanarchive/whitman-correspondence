                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>   
            </opener>
            <p>Thank you for the copy of "<hi rend="underline">Once a Week</hi>"<ptr target="loc.04696_n3"/> 
                you sent me &amp; which I received on the 17<hi rend="underline">th</hi> ult.—I noted especially the account of The
                O'Gorman Mahon,<ptr target="loc.04696_n1"/> &amp; the pictures &amp; leader relating
                to the Indians. It reminded me of your "Indian Bureau Reminiscences,"<ptr target="loc.04696_n4"/> which I re-read <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01074.jpg" type="verso"/> I hope that your artist friend "B.H."<ptr target="n5001"/> "regained his health" &amp; has been successful in his studies
                &amp; work.</p>
            <p>I send you herewith a copy of "<hi rend="underline">The Magazine of Art</hi>"<ptr target="loc.04696_n5"/> for
                January,—containing a photogravure &amp; engravings of earlier portraits of
                    Ruskin,<ptr target="n3013"/> which I think will interest you.</p>
            <p>I have long been deeply interested in his books, &amp; it used to be one of my main
                desires to give <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01075.jpg" type="recto"/> them
                complete &amp; exhaustive study that I, too, might contribute a little to their
                exposition &amp; support.</p>
            <p>And I still think that no English author—since his master Carlyle<ptr target="n4301"/>—so emphatically deserves it, &amp; deserves the
                sympathetic &amp; careful study of his race. And at <hi rend="underline">no</hi>
                period, probably, has a braver, purer spirit ever spent his passionate force in
                literature for the sacred cause of human well-being. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01076.jpg" type="verso"/> His message (with whatever
                limitations,—&amp; they are great) is one of deep importance to his
                generation, &amp; should be laid well to heart. But it still needs to be set in its
                due relationship &amp; needs (it seems to me) to be corrected &amp; offset by the
                larger &amp; complementary (or rather over-arching) teaching which <hi rend="underline">you</hi> have given us. I have long desired to attempt to do
                this. And, with better health &amp; strength,<ptr target="loc.02460_n5"/> &amp; under <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01077.jpg" type="recto"/> more favourable conditions, I yet hope to
                do something towards it.</p> 
            <p>I often wonder to what extent you are acquainted with his books. No doubt you know
                some of them well. They are antagonistic, of course, in several essential respects,
                to your own. But I am often struck, in minor points, with the degree in which they
                are not only in unison with yours, but in which they support &amp; illustrate them.
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01078.jpg" type="verso"/> "Wisdom is
                justified of <hi rend="underline">all</hi> her children,"<ptr target="loc.04696_n7"/> and the truth of every
                man's work or thought is eliminated, in course of time, to the last fraction, from
                the false, &amp; helps onward the march of human progress.—If Ruskin is narrow
                &amp; wilful—if he "prescribes specifics for indispensible evils," or
                if,—Quixote-like,—he tilts at times against imaginary foes, let us, not
                any the less, revere the <unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">nobleness</unclear> of his aims, &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01079.jpg" type="recto"/> &amp; honour, with swelling love &amp;
                gratitude, the fiery war against the evils of his time, in which he has spent his
                energies &amp; wasted his heart.</p>
            <p>One wishes, at times, that he had known you personally long ago, &amp; could have had
                familiar talk with you, face to face, as he had with Carlyle.<ptr target="n4301"/></p>
            <p>And I have often been disposed to wish that Carlyle could have done so too. Your
                great love for him is very manifest. <unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">And</unclear>
                <hi rend="underline">he</hi>, <unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">above</unclear>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01080.jpg" type="verso"/> all others, loved a man
                &amp; knew one when he saw one.</p>
            <p>—How sad &amp; strange, it seems at times, that he should have never really
                known you at all! But the Divine Providence is wise. It was Carlyle's lot to do a
                great &amp; needed service, which, under other conditions, would perhaps have never
                been done. And though one wishes for <hi rend="underline">his</hi> sake that he
                could have learned of you, &amp; though it might have saved him desolating pain
                &amp; loneliness of heart, yet, <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_vm.01081.jpg" type="recto"/> who shall say that his great soul was not better for the terrible
                toils &amp; grim purgatorial fires through which he passed, &amp; for the agonizings
                &amp; fierce travail throes of his prophetic (however partial) message?</p>
            <p>And it has seemed clear to me, in reading Ruskin's latest books, (the later vols. of
                "<hi rend="underline">Fors Clavigera</hi>"<ptr target="loc.04696_n8"/> especially) that in his passionate
                crusade against the evils of our modern life—notwithstanding its bruises to
                his delicate, susceptible spirit, &amp; the yet more bitter separation <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc_vm.01082.jpg" type="verso"/> of life &amp; isolation
                of soul in which it has placed him.—(as of one "crying in the wilderness"<ptr target="loc.04696_n9"/>) he
                has, nevertheless, gained in spiritual depth &amp; insight, &amp; (I think) in a
                deeper trust in the ultimate good to follow the vast movements &amp; (to him)
                apparent disintegration &amp; retrogression of our time.</p> 
            <p>He does not love your Republic &amp; its aims<unclear reason="cut away" resp="#aa" cert="high">.</unclear> But no other living English author, I think<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aa" cert="high">,</unclear> has made <gap reason="illegible" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> (with all
                deductions) so valuable a contribution to its <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc_vm.01083.jpg" type="recto"/> sociology &amp; evolution. (Though I
                recognize its limitations &amp; drawbacks.—&amp; see how much better is the
                ideal to which America is actually tending—independently of any authors).</p>
            <p>Pardon my writing to you thus.—But it is partly <hi rend="underline">because</hi> I have loved Carlyle &amp; Ruskin from long years, &amp; studied
                their books, that <hi rend="underline">your</hi> teaching has been so precious to
                me.—</p>
            <p>I hope that you are keeping better—The weather here is very variable—a
                day <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc_vm.01084.jpg" type="verso"/> or two of
                thaw—or rain—followed by sharp frost &amp; snow.</p>
