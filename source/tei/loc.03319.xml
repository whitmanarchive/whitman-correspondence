                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Back here again last night&#8212;after a fine time of it at Mrs. Nordhoff's,<ptr target="n4141"/> where everyone was so kind &#38; the fun so continued all day long, that I did not find time to write you even a line.</p> 
            <p>There were some jolly young fellows there, &#38; some splendid girls, but among the last 
                I think Alys Smith<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> may be said to have "taken the cake." Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have delighted your eyes to see her dance,&#8212;"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"&#8212;The house itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
                the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &#38; far away up &#38; down the Hudson. The place <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#es">would</unclear>

            have thoroughly suited you for a camping spot.</p>
            <p>Passing through New York yesterday, in a bright, splendid sunlight, the rush of life in Broadway made me wish you could have been with me there.</p>            
            <p>After the stupid, half-&#38;-half pretence of Philadelphia, the reckless, go-ahead life in New York is very refreshing. Tell this not to the Philadelphians!</p>                
            <p>No letters arrived at Alpine Bergen for me,&#8212;so I suppose none have reached you! If there are any waiting now, will you mail them on here. I expect to go to Boston on Friday or Saturday&#8212;after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/> at Belmont.</p>
            <p>I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &#38; with all my friends&#8212;in the higher, eternal sense, if not always &#38; altogether in the other!</p>
