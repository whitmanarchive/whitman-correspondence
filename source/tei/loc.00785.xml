               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have been thinking to-day &amp; all yesterday about the draft in Brooklyn, &amp; whether Jeff would be drafted&#8212;you must some of you write me just as soon as you get this<ptr target="loc.00785_n1"/>&#8212;I want to know, I feel anxious enough I can tell you&#8212;&amp; besides it seems a good while since I have rec'd any letters from home&#8212;Of course it is impossible for Jeff to go, in case it should turn out he was drafted&#8212;the way our family is all situated now, it would be madness&#8212;If the Common Council raise the money to exempt men with families dependent on them, I think Jeff ought to have no scruples in taking advantage of it, as I think he is in duty bound&#8212;but we will see what course to take, when we know the result &amp;c. Write about it right away.</p>
            <p>The Eagles came, this is the second time&#8212;I am always glad to get them&#8212;Jeff, wait till you get four or five, &amp; then send them with a two cent stamp&#8212;I have not had any letter from George<ptr target="loc.00785_n2"/>&#8212;Mother, have you heard any thing? did the money come? Dear mother, how are you nowadays&#8212;I do hope you feel well &amp; in good spirits&#8212;I think about you every day of my life out here&#8212;sometimes I see women in the hospitals, mothers come to see their sons, &amp; occasionally one that makes me think of my dear mother&#8212;one did very much, a lady about 60, from Pennsylvania, come to see her son, a Captain, very badly wounded, &amp; his wound gangrened, &amp; they after a while removed him to a tent by himself&#8212;another son of hers, a young man, came with her to see his brother&#8212;she was pretty full-sized lady, with spectacles, she dressed in black, looked real Velsory. I got very well acquainted with her, she had a real Long-Island old fashioned way&#8212;but I had to avoid the poor Captain as it was that time that my hand was cut in the artery, &amp; I was liable to gangrene myself&#8212;but she and the two sons have gone home now, but I doubt whether the wounded one is alive as he was very low&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I want to hear about Andrew too, whether he went to Rockland lake<ptr target="loc.00785_n3"/>&#8212;You have no idea how many soldiers there are who have lost their voices, &amp; have to speak in whispers&#8212;there are a great many, I meet some almost every day&#8212;As far as that alone is concerned Andrew must not be discouraged, as the general health may be good as common irrespective of that&#8212;I do hope Andrew will get along better than he thinks for&#8212;it is bad enough for a poor man to be out of health even partially, but he must try to look on the bright side&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, have you heard any thing from Han since, or from Mary's folks? I got a letter from Mrs Price<ptr target="loc.00785_n4"/> last week, if you see Emma tell her I was pleased to get it, &amp; shall answer it very soon&#8212;Mother, I have sent another letter to the N Y Times,<ptr target="loc.00785_n5"/> it may appear, if not to-day, within a few days&#8212;I am feeling excellent well these days, it is so moderate &amp; pleasant weather now, I was getting real exhausted with the heat. I thought of you too, how it must have exhausted you those hot days&#8212;I still occupy the same little 3d story room, 394 L st, &amp; get my breakfast in my room in the morning myself, &amp; dinner at a restaurant about 3 o'clock&#8212;I get along very well &amp; very economical (which is a forced put, but just as well). But I must get another room or a boarding house soon, as the folks are all going to move this month&#8212;My good &amp; <hi rend="italic">real</hi> friends the O'Connors live in the same block, I am in there every day&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear Mother, tell Mat &amp; Miss Mannahatta I send them my love&#8212;I want to see them both&#8212;O how I want to see Jeff &amp; you, mother, I sometimes feel as if I should just get in the cars &amp; come home&#8212;&amp; the baby too, you must always write about her&#8212;dear mother, good bye for present&#8212;</p>
