                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>I believe you told me sometime ago that you had a friend at Los Angeles, Cal. 
                If you have, I wish you would give me a line of introduction to
                him for my brother Bertie (Albert)<ptr target="n5001"/> who has just left hospital after a month's
                illness with typhoid fever, and who at such a distance from home and friends feels
                (I'm afraid) homesick and possibly despondent. If I had known earlier I would have
                gone on to Los Angeles myself, to nurse the lad; but this seems unnecessary now that
                he is able to get about again. You will easily understand, however, that I feel
                pretty anxious, and if you can let me have a line as I suggest, it will be a great
                help.</p>
            <p>Down here I've been talking again about the New Poetry—on Monday in Boston, and
                last night before the Harvard students who gave me a very hearty reception—the
                best I've had so far. I find there is quite an earnest feeling for Leaves of Grass
                among a great many of them. You have no doubt got their invitation to lecture<ptr target="nyp.00728_n1"/> by
                this time—which I told you sometime ago they were preparing to send.</p>
            <p>Next week (as you will see by my enclosed circular) I am to speak in Chickering Hall<ptr target="nyp.00728_n2"/>
                on Literary London—rather a rash adventure, I'm afraid.</p>
            <p>Has Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> returned yet? I must write and ask him whether he
                can arrange a talk at London, Ontario, or not.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>With remembrances to Mrs. Davis.<ptr target="n6113"/> Yours
                    affectionately</salute>
