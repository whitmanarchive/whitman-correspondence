            <p>I write to enclose you a letter I have just received from George.<ptr target="loc.00763_n1"/> His corps, (Ninth Army,) and perhaps one other, are to move either to Fort Monroe, or somewhere down there&#8212;some say Suffolk. I am in hopes that when they get there, George will still have a sight for a furlough&#8212;I have written him I should think four letters since the 27th Jan&#8212;(and have sent him Han's letter to you in one)&#8212;I hope he has got most of them before this&#8212;I am afraid the $3. change I sent him is gone&#8212;He will write to you as soon as he gets settled wherever they go to&#8212;I don't know as it makes any difference in respect to danger, or fighting, from this move&#8212;One reason they have to move from the Rappahannock, up there, is that wood is all gone for miles, forage is scarce to get, and I don't know as there is any need of there staying there, for any purpose&#8212;In some haste, dearest mother, as I am off to visit for an hour or so, one of my hospitals. Your affectionate son</p>
