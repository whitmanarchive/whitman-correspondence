            <p>Continued good-will well-supported by <hi rend="underline">a constantly enlarging</hi> sense of your great merit as a writer fitted to both please and instruct, leads me to write this after quite a spell of silence. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">I</unclear> can make it, <choice><abbr>tho'</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice>, only a sorry <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">sort</unclear> of <hi rend="underline">an Appendix</hi> to the series of letters I was <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">sending you</unclear> through the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">first</unclear> half and seventh month of <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">the year</unclear>. The intention or one purpose of these letters being to divert <gap reason="illegible" extent="two words"/> you with <hi rend="underline">a phase of life</hi> that probably <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#js">not</unclear> fail to be <hi rend="underline">new</hi> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">to you</unclear>. As I have sometimes <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">said</unclear> <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> many <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">years</unclear> past, it is doubtful whether any one could imagine a human character <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">certainly</unclear> but that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">the</unclear> wide world could furnish <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">one specimen</unclear> to fill its requirements&#8212;so, on the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">other hand</unclear>, it is altogether impossible for one individual <gap reason="illegible" extent="two words"/> considerably or markedly different from all <gap reason="illegible" extent="two words"/> have come under the observation of any one man. And this is a good answer to those <hi rend="underline">fools</hi> who say there cannot be so much as <hi rend="underline">one perfectly honest</hi> man on earth. I have said I was fully convinced there are men who would not <hi rend="underline">yield their integrity</hi> for <hi rend="underline">an endless life</hi> and as much <hi rend="underline">gold as half the bulk of the earth</hi> with the other half to spend it on at present value&#8212;nor would they accept the <hi rend="underline">throne</hi> and <hi rend="underline">prerogatives of God</hi> on such condition (of being unjust).</p>
            
            <p>In your first letter (more than a year ago) you said you would "much, much" like to "look in upon" me&#8212;well, you <hi rend="underline">have</hi> looked in upon a real, live, "good enough" and also (by <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">jingo</unclear>!) <hi rend="underline">not too good</hi> a man&#8212;a sincere, enthusiastic admirerer, and yet in such told and untold particulars <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">as</unclear> we might differ about, a man "sufficient for himself" and whom laws, theories "conventions" and even <hi rend="underline">other</hi> Philosophers and Poets <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> not "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">muster</unclear>"&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">And</unclear> so I ask you, did I not <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">conduct my</unclear> part of that correspondence rightly? For, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">naturally one</unclear> whose

            acquaintance should be sought by another man would wish to know&#8212;what does he want? <hi rend="underline">where</hi> is he? and <hi rend="underline">what</hi> is he? <hi rend="underline">This is enough</hi>.</p>

            <p>(My last before this were July 18 and Aug 14</p>
            <p>I will relieve you of any fears that I shall (of myself be wanting to write and be written to so frequently hereafter&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">whereupon</unclear> looking for anything from you it creates a "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">fiendish</unclear> expectation" that <hi rend="underline">troubles</hi> me on account <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">of the</unclear> <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> way to and from the Post Office 3½ X 2 = 7 <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">miles&#8212;ordinary</unclear> mail matter I generally wait for the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">pleasant</unclear> season or some <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#js">insight to</unclear> pass to <gap reason="illegible" extent="about two words"/> you are publishing anything new I would <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">like to</unclear> have it if you can <hi rend="underline">credit</hi> me for it <gap reason="illegible" extent="two or three words"/> send pay.</p>
            <p>(Your last a card Aug 13)</p>
            <p>The autumn <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> and November season, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">usually</unclear> by far the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">loveliest of</unclear> all the seasons here, has been much trespassed upon <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">by</unclear> spells of cloudy and rainy weather like our <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">common <hi rend="underline">winter</hi></unclear>weather&#8212;beyond any precedent.  The sharp frosts just before and about Oct 15, coming before the forest foliage had matured enough to drop spontaneously, our superabundance of wildwood was clad two weeks ago with unusual, surpassing splendor and sweetness, but now, much of the glory is gone.  Perhaps to the eye of a Poet and <hi rend="underline">true</hi> Philosopher <hi rend="underline">the ripe cotton ball is beautiful as the rose</hi>&#8212;then shouldn't the cotton field be a rose-garden without thorns? ☞ <hi rend="underline">Put me</hi> to kneeling, crawling, sitting, squatting among the cotton rows, fingers busy with the beautiful and useful, and thoughts flying undisturbedly over all the earth in search of congenialities and reminiscences and then I am a <hi rend="underline"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">ever</unclear> so happy</hi> diminutive Philosopher and <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> Poet.  Of all work I have always liked cotton-<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">picking</unclear> the best.  And now let this bit of <hi rend="underline">gossip</hi> be <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">respectful</unclear> and kind leave taking or a part of <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">something</unclear> to be continued at long <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">interval</unclear> as may <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">suit you</unclear> best.</p>
