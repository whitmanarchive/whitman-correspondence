            </opener>

            <p>Continued good-will well&#8211;supported by <hi rend="underline">a constantly
                    enlarging</hi> sense of your great merit as a writer fitted to both please and
                instruct, leads me to write this after quite a spell of silence. I can make it, <choice>
                    <abbr>tho'</abbr>
                    <expan>though</expan>
                </choice>, only a sorry sort of <hi rend="underline">an Appendix</hi> to the series
                of letters I was sending you through the first half and seventh month of the year.
                The intention or one purpose of these letters being to divert or entertain you with <hi rend="underline">a
                    phase of life</hi> that probably would not
                fail to be <hi rend="underline">new</hi> to you. As I have sometimes said during many years past, it is doubtful
                whether any one could imagine a human character so <hi rend="underline">strange</hi>
                but that the wide world could furnish <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"
                    resp="#al">one</unclear> specimen to fill its requirements&#8212;so, on the
                other hand, it is altogether possible for one individual to <unclear reason="illegible"
                    resp="#smb" cert="low">exist</unclear> considerably or markedly different from all who can have
                come under the observation of any one man. And this is a good answer to those <hi
                    rend="underline">fools</hi> who say there cannot be so much as <hi
                    rend="underline">one perfectly honest</hi> man on earth. I have said I was fully
                convinced there are men who would not <hi rend="underline">yield their
                    integrity</hi> for <hi rend="underline">an endless life</hi> and as much <hi
                    rend="underline">gold as half the bulk of the earth</hi> with the other half to
                spend it on at present value&#8212;nor would they accept the <hi rend="underline"
                    >throne</hi> and <hi rend="underline">prerogatives of God</hi> on such condition
                (of being unjust).</p>
            <p>In your first letter (more than a year ago) you said you would "much, much" like to
                "look in upon" me&#8212;well, you <hi rend="underline">have</hi> looked in upon a
                real, live, "good enough" and also (by jingo!) <hi rend="underline">not too
                    good</hi> a man&#8212;a sincere, enthusiastic admirerer, and yet in such told
                and untold particulars as we might differ about, a man "sufficient for himself" and
                whom laws, theories, conventions" and even <hi rend="underline">other</hi>
                Philosophers and Poets <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> not "master"&#8212;And so I ask
                you, did I not conduct my part of that correspondence rightly? For, naturally one
                whose <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_tb.00778.jpg" type="verso"/>
                acquaintance should be sought by another man would wish to know&#8212;what does he
                want? <hi rend="underline">where</hi> is he? and <hi rend="underline">what</hi> is
                he? <hi rend="underline">This is enough</hi>.</p>
            <p>(My last before this were July 18 and Aug 14<ptr target="loc.01847_n1"/></p>
            <p>I will relieve you of any fears that I shall (of myself) be wanting to write and be
                written to so frequently hereafter&#8212;when I am looking for anything from you it
                creates a "fiendish expectation" that <hi rend="underline">troubles</hi> me on
                account of the <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#smb">long</unclear> way to and from the Post
                Office 3&#189; X 2 = 7 miles&#8212;ordinary mail matter I generally wait for till
                <gap reason="illegible" quantity="7" unit="chars"/>t season or
                some <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="medium">ungulates</unclear> pass to
                and fro. If you are publishing anything new I
                would like to have it if you can <hi rend="underline">credit</hi> me for it till I
                can send pay.</p>
            <p>(Your last a card Aug 13)<ptr target="n5002c"/></p>
            <p>The autumn or October and November season, usually by far the loveliest of all the
                seasons here, has been much trespassed upon by spells of cloudy and rainy weather
                like our common <hi rend="underline">winter</hi> weather&#8212;beyond any precedent.
                The sharp frosts just before and about Oct 15, coming before the forest foliage had
                matured enough to drop spontaneously, our superabundance of wildwood was clad two
                weeks ago with unusual, surpassing splendor and sweetness, but now, much of the
                glory is gone. Perhaps to the eye of a Poet and <hi rend="underline">true</hi>
                Philosopher <hi rend="underline">the ripe cotton ball is beautiful as the
                rose</hi>&#8212;then shouldn't the cotton field be a rose-garden without thorns?
                &#9755; <hi rend="underline">Put me</hi> to kneeling, crawling, sitting, squatting
                among the cotton rows, fingers busy with the beautiful and useful, and thoughts
                flying undisturbedly over all the earth in search of congenialities and
                reminiscences and then I am a <hi rend="underline">never so happy</hi> diminutive
                Philosopher and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#me"
                    >voiceless</unclear> Poet. Of all work I have always liked cotton-picking the
                best. And now let this bit of <hi rend="underline">gossip</hi> be a respectful and
                kind leave taking or a part of something to be continued at long interval<unclear
                    reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="medium">s</unclear> as may
                suit you best.</p>
