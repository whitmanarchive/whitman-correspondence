            <p>Merry Christmas, dear Friend, &#38; a happy New Year!&#8212;from frau<ptr target="loc.02897_n3"/> and me.</p>
            <p>She is sending Xmas presents, &#38; receiving 'em. I send you a little box of 
                confections<ptr target="owu.00015_n3"/>
                by Adams Exp.<ptr target="loc.03113_n2"/> with my love. Besides her, you are the only one I have remembered.
                Sent mine home 2
                months ago.</p>
            <p>Feel pretty poor this winter; we are scrimping &#38; pinching to try to save a little.
                Expenses are so great. Tell me what you hd for Xmas. I got an umbrella 3&#36;, nice one.
                People in Boston were <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> over Xmas.
                Never seen the streets <hi rend="underline">so full</hi> of happy folks

            Our huge snow-storm has congealed into crust &#38; ice this morning. I have been down
                with a pertinacious cold (bronchial) for 3 weeks. It is too bad you have so many
                troubles (with the "old shack"). I wish I could bear some of yr pain. I wd. gladly
                do it.</p> 
            <p>Do you suppose a thousand years fr now people will be celebrating the birth of Walt
                Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ? If they don't the more fools they.<pb
                xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03113.003.jpg" type="recto"/> But I hope they won't
                mythologize you &#38; idiotize themselves as they do over that poor Christ. Why the
                glorious mystic &#38; genius wd have cut his throat if he had known what idiots people
                were to be over him. However he has been an enormous influence for good.</p>
            <p>"Peace on Earth good will to men."</p>
            <p>By the way have you noticed the curious wing-bone-like things<ptr target="loc.03113_n3"/> the only real angels we
                know of are wearing on their shoulders? What fragments the average man &#38; the average
                woman are! The complete homo wd combine them both in perfect musical harmony.</p>
            <p>I see in Critic<ptr target="loc.03113_n4"/> (Nov 29 I think) accounts of yr forthcoming book. It pleases me
                much.</p>
