            <p>Merry Christmas, dear Friend, + a happy New Year!&#8212;from frau and me.</p>

            <p>She is sending Xmas presents, + receiving 'em. I send you a little box of confections
                by Adams Exp. with my love. Besides her, you are the only one I have remembered.
                Sent mine home <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ktl">9</unclear>
                months ago.</p>
            <p>Feel pretty poor this winter; we are scrimping + pinching to try to save a little.
                Expenses are so great. Tell me what you hd for Xmas. I got an umbrella 3$, nice one.
                People in Boston were <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> over Xmas.
                Never seen the streets <hi rend="underline">so full</hi> of happy folks</p>

            <p>Our huge snow-storm has congealed into crust + ice this morning. I have been down
                with a pertinacious cold (bronchial) for 3 weeks. It is too bad you have so many
                troubles (with the "old shack"). I wish I could bear some of yr pain. I wd. gladly
                do it.</p>
            <p>Do you suppose a thousand years fr now people will be celebrating the birth of Walt
                Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ? If they don't the more fools they.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03113.003.jpg" type="recto"/> But I hope they won't
                mythologize you + idiotize themselves as they do over that poor Christ. Why the
                glorious mystic + genius wd have cut his throat if he had known what idiots people
                were to be over him. However he has been an enormous influence for good.</p>
            <p>"Peace on Earth good will to men."</p>
            <p>By the way have you noticed the curious wing-bone-like things the only real angels we
                know of are wearing on their shoulders? What fragments the average man + the average
                woman are! The complete hours wd combine them both in perfect musical harmony.</p>
            <p>I see in Critic (Nov 29 I think) accounts of yr forthcoming book. It pleases me
                much.</p>
