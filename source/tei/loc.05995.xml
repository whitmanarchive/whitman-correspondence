                <p>As you see by my address I am staying with a great friend of yours. You may see him
                    this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,&#8212;going out as a
                    schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet
                    earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth,
                    whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a
                    clergyman, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00566_large.jpg" type="recto"/><!-- This is not actually a separate leaf; it is the other half of the first recto surface, but since we do not have an image of the entire surface, 
                        both parts of the recto had to be split up into separate images. In order for the file to validate, 
                        this has been marked as a separate leaf.--> and
                    this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently unobserved by the rest of his orthodox
                    family.</p>
                <p>I posted a copy of my book to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and
                    tell me how you like it.</p>
                <p>Andrew Lang<ptr target="n3116"/> wrote a leader in the Daily News about it and fine
                    things have been said in the London, and <hi rend="underline">Scotch Press</hi>
                    particularly. As yet, I have not taken
                    my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time
                    near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly
                    within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &#38;</p>
