            miles long and 4 wide  we left Hateras with a fleet of about 70 vessels  only 15 or 16

            and shells like blazes  the Staten Island Ferry boat Hunchback which had some heavy guns

            morning  we had breakfast of good crackers, put more crackers in our haversacks and then
            fell in for a march  we moved off in two Brigades  we being the second numbering all
            told about 7000 men with a battery of 5 howitzers  we struck directly into the woods and

            as possible  we were under fire about an hour and a half before our regiment dare fire a
            shot for fear of shooting our own friends as we could not see 10 yards on either side.

            traveling about an hour we found two dead rebels lying in the woods and farther on lay
            another just dying  the top of his head being shot off  a little way from these we met a
