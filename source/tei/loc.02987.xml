                    Dear Walt,

            </opener>
            <p>
                Thank you for all papers &amp;c. that you have so kindly sent, &amp; especially for the "Poet-Lore" with 
                article about William,<ptr target="n2002"/> &amp; the Transcript of the 19. with notice of your Lincoln 
                Memorial evening. It is good, &amp; I am thankful that you could go &amp; and do it. Most noble
                &amp; fitting; &amp; I wish I could have been there.
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02987.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>
               As for me, dear Walt, I feel as if I had been more or less under a cloud, the cloud that comes of having to
               give too much thought &amp; care to this world's affairs,&#8212; the 
                <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#kw" cert="low">tow</unclear> to provide for the food, shelter 
                &amp; raiment of the body. My friends have been trying to get me a place in the Census Bureau, but as yet
               without success. I felt that I must hold on to this little home till I could see my way somewhat, &amp; I 
               think I have done well in so doing. I hope to be able to have a home still,
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02987.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
               &amp; a plan is now under consideration by which I hope to have a home with a friend. If it matures I will 
               let you know. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon it will be a year since William passed on! The 9th of May, so soon here now, &amp; what a long year 
                it has been to me; &amp; yet in another way it seems but yesterday that I watched his last hours.&#8212; I
                am very sorry to learn that you have been down with the "grip," which we have had here.
            </p>
            <p>
                You told me that you have, or can get 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02987.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                all Magazines &amp; papers. Have you seen the "New England Magazine" for <hi rend="underline">March</hi> 1890. 
                It has a story "A Strange Dinner Party"&#8212; by my niece, Grace Ellery Channing. If you get it, &amp; read 
                it, &amp; don't care to keep it, I shall be glad of it. She is writing quite a good deal, but says that since 
                her uncle William O'Connor died, she feels that her "literary conscience is gone." She also

                has published in the "Overland Monthly" but I never <choice><sic>see</sic><corr>saw</corr></choice> that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will send you a little poem of hers, &amp; will like you to return it, as I have no other of hers. It was in
                "Kate Field's Washington" of Feb. 12 1890. 
            </p>
            <p>
                How I wish I could run over &amp; see you! When "my ship comes in," I will. Will it come in, in this life?
            </p>
            <p>
                I must not forget to tell you that our old lady friend,
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02987.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>     
                Mrs. Johnson<ptr target="n0334"/> died last Wednesday, at the age of 95 years &amp; 4 months! Of old age&#8212;the 
                doctor said she had <hi rend="underline">no disease</hi>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I send you, dear Walt a paper that that I promised, with notice of William's funeral. Send a postal card to let
                me know get them, please.
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02987.007_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>
                I am alone still, but am to have two young girls with me for six weeks, to board until their schools 
                <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#kw" cert="low">done.</unclear>
            </p>
            <p>
                One reason why I have so desired to hold on to a home, is that in the pecuniary distress of the 
                Channings<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> if they have to give up their beautiful home in Cal. I may have
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01172.004_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                a refuge for them here, &amp; so perhaps return in small measure their many benefits to us in the time of 
                dear Jeannie's<ptr target="n4138"/> sickness, &amp; again when William went out there. But, dear Walt, I 
                try to keep up a good heart, &amp; not doubt or dispond.
