         <p>The undersigned though a comparative stranger to you feels himself drawn toward you
            closer and closer after perusing your "Leaves of Grass." We have a sympathy in common
            with you. in some of these well wrought passages the experiences taught there has been
            one to some extent.</p>
         <p>While doing garrison duty with my regiment the 2nd New York Arty on the works South of
            the Potomac I visited Washington in company with a comrade named Charles String of
               Connecticut<ptr target="loc.00873_n1"/> and by him introduced to you at your studio.
            (I forget the street) but it was not far removed from the avenue. if I mistake not, you
            accompanied us to the theatre at night. I have never forgotten you since, remembering
            you as a friend to the Union and the "boys" striving to keep it together. I left the
            regiment in the trenches in front of Petersburgh, my term of Service having expired,
            after three years Service from Oct 1861. on arriving at Washington I tried to find you
            but could not. when you first met me, on leaving you you gave me a small book of poems
            with your name in it, bidding me think of you. I stowed it away in my knapsack but
            loosing that I lost your gift. I would like a duplicate, if it is not presuming too
            much. I trust you will not think me forward in this. With many and kind regards</p>
