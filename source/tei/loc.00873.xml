         <p>The undersigned<ptr target="loc.00873_n100"/> though a comparative stranger to you feels himself drawn toward you closer and closer after perusing your "Leaves of Grass."  We have a sympathy in common with you. in some of these well wrought passages the experiences taught there has been one to some extent.</p>
            <p>While doing garrison duty with my regiment the 2nd New York Arty on the works South of the Potomac I visited Washington in company with a comrade named Charles String of Connecticut and by him introduced to you at your studio. (I forget the street) but it was not far removed from the avenue. if I mistake not, you accompanied us to the theatre at night. I have never forgotten you since, remembering you as a friend to the Union and the "boys" striving to keep it together. I left the regiment in the trenches in front of Petersburgh, my term of Service having expired, after three years Service from Oct 1861.  on arriving at Washington I tried to find you but could not.  when you first met me, on leaving you you gave me a small book of poems with your name in it, bidding me think of you.  I stowed it away in my knapsack but loosing that I lost your gift.  I would like a duplicate, if it is not presuming too much.  I trust you will not think me forward in this.  With many and kind regards</p>
