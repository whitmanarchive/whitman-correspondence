I had no father, mother, sister, and but one nude, repellent brother and his wife a good match for him.) Now, that girl of mine for 10 years was the purest, gentlest, and generally the most cheerfully amiable person that <hi rend="underline"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">could be imagined</unclear></hi>&#8212;I "fairly" <hi rend="underline">worshipped</hi> her from <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">beginning</unclear> to end, and was perhaps as happy <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">in marriage</unclear> with her as a man could possibly be <gap reason="illegible" extent="one or two words"/> Yet she had that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">fault</unclear>&#8212;I don't <gap reason="illegible" extent="three words"/> got or could get the <hi rend="underline">thought <gap reason="illegible" extent="two words"/></hi> into her head&#8212;she appeared <gap reason="illegible" extent="two ro three words"/> pervious to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> of enthu<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">siasm</unclear> <gap reason="illegible" unit="char" extent="1 word"/> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">in</unclear>deed my life with her

I thought it would be too great a task to <hi rend="underline">hunt the world over</hi> for <hi rend="underline">a perfect match</hi>. The present Mrs "Philosopher" is not destitute of various desirable qualities&#8212;she is very "shrewd," and <hi rend="underline">too nice</hi> a housekeeper&#8212;Yet she is another one of the sort <hi rend="underline">not enthusible</hi>.

            <p>I find myself nothing like so happy a man as I was before the war&#8212;yet my property losses never troubled me <hi rend="underline">"one bit"</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">few</hi> of my near relatives lost their lives or otherwise badly "hurt".
