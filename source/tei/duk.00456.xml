                hair blanched—whitened—her hands shrunken—the bones protruding as it were—yet she has staunchly kneaded bread and
                made a sweet loaf for herself, she has been craving after, several days—The public have treated us well—1 ton of coal now in use, sent by
                Isham J. Bliss, Episcopal clergyman, an old friend—50 lbs choice flour—3 fowls and a turkey, by other friends unknown—bread,

                timely—I had sold a small painting for 10—I send you the bank rect—very stupid and very mean I consider George<ptr target="n0700"/> and Lou

                One more claim for flagging side walk, $86. I have paid up nearly all. I think that I can settle balance for 10$—Have some
