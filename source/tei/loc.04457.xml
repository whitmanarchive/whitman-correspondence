            </opener> 
            <p> Two or three times within the last half dozen days we have seen (and felt badly
                about) squibs in the papers saying you were "sick"&#8212;"not well" "confined to his
                room" etc etc. Each day I have been hoping to get something from you&#8212;but
                as the days pass and I do not I am beginning to fear that it is possible that you
                are not getting on as well as usual, and that there may be some foundation for the
                newspaper stuff, more than usual with you </p>
            <p> Dear Walt, we all hope and pray that it is not so, yet, fear that you may not be as
                well as usual, and hope you will let us know just how you are getting on. The last
                time we heard from you, you said you did not feel quite as well as usual, but that
                you had been out on a long drive and that you were able to get out every day on
                two&#8212;is there anything different now? </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad.00538_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p> We are jogging along, as best we may. I manage to be at home and with Jess<ptr target="n1055"/>
                considerable of the time, and often I take her with me when I visit the works, and
                the places where they are building. I find both for her and myself there is nothing
                like the open air, the out doors. As good luck would have it we have had a splendid
                fall as regard weather, and too my work has been of such a kind that I could be out much of the time, and
                this way we manage, after a fashion, to
                put in the days, yet, there are times when it does seem as if it was impossible to
                keep up. </p>
            <p> It is pretty hard on Jess to leave her alone (with servants of
                course) in the house yet at times (for a short time) this does occur, and of course
                she gives way to her feelings, poor child, but I am doing my best to counteract it
                all I can do. </p>
            <p> Dear Walt write upon the receipt of this and let us know how you are. We always like
                to hear from you it seems to help. </p>
