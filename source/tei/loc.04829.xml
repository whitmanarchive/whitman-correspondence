            <p>Quite a beautiful day—clear &amp; frosty—very pleasant &amp; bracing after the wet 
            stormy weather we have had of late.—</p>
            <p>The last two evenings I have been paying long-deferred visits to friends—Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> &amp; Sam 
                Hodgkinson<ptr target="loc.04829_n1"/>—with a 
                brief call on Hutton<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> on Thursday.—All well &amp; prospering fairly.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01978_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I was at Johnston's<ptr target="n4102"/> too one evening—Tuesday I think I called too 
                on Nightingale<ptr target="loc.04829_n3"/> &amp; he is to come tomorrow morning (Sunday)
                to spend the day here.</p>
            <p>I have been quite unsettled as to business arrangements since I came home.—The offers I have received have been unsatifactory 
                to me &amp; I have refused them. But I have practically decided on coming to terms on a basis which, though 
                far from satisfactory to me, may do provisionally.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01979_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>It is perhaps better so. For I know more clearly than I did the character of the men I have been dealing with, &amp; the 
                nature of my position. And I can act accordingly.</p>
            <p>I have been reading Carpenter's<ptr target="n0141b"/> book "Towards Democracy,"<ptr target="loc.04829_n4"/> &amp; 
                like it much better than I expected. I feel impelled to write to him &amp; should like to know him better</p>
            <p>Lynch's<ptr target="loc.03222_n2"/> book I have not read yet—beyond the first chapter.</p>
            <p>I am clear of my cold again &amp; feel pretty well. And all the friends are well I think.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01980_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I have scarcely realized that Christmas is so close upon us. It will be over when you get this. I ordered some 
                cards &amp; expected to get them in time 
                for the American Mail, but owing to some blunder I have not got them yet.</p>
            <p>I am anxious to receive some better account of your health &amp; condition than 
                that in your last postal.<ptr target="loc.04829_n2"/></p>
            <p>Copies of <hi rend="underline">"Three Tales"</hi><ptr target="loc.08192_n3"/> received. I quite like the get up of the little book &amp; am 
                very pleased to have it.</p>
            <p>Love to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &amp; to yourself supremely.</p>
            <closer>
