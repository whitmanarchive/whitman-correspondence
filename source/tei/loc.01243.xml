            <p>So glad to hear from you once more—and that you keep going, not withstanding
                all the buffets of time &amp; fortune. Very wearisome sometimes I fear, these long
                spells of illness: so complicated, never-ended. Just now I am giving every day to

                I fear you must feel like that! Dear Walt—how strange it is that we are bound
                so &amp; entangled in this thing we call the body, without being able to get at the <hi rend="underline">connections</hi>. I got <choice>
