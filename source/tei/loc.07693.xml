                <p>Your welcome p'card of July 23<hi rend="underline">rd</hi><ptr target="loc.03338_n2"/> reminds me how the time
                    has slipped away since my last letter to you. I have now been here in North Wales
                    for nearly six weeks, having retreated to these mountains very soon after returning
                    from Paris. I am lodged very comfortably in the cottage of a
                    quarry-man,&#8212;William Davies,<ptr target="n5001"/> who works at <choice><sic>Festiniog</sic><corr>Ffestiniog</corr></choice>, 
                    5 or 6 miles from here. He is a very good type,&#8212;healthy,
                    well-built, good-natured, impulsive, with the over-carefulness of the average
                    Welshman tempered by his experiences of American life, for "he went to the states,"
                    as they say here, some years back, &#38; travelled far &#38; wide, working in mines &#38;
                    quarries. Even now he does not talk English very fluently, &#38; prefers his native
                    Welsh, in which he gives me lessons every night on his return from work. Many people
                    in the district speak no English at all. The Welsh are a peculiarly adhesive race, &#38;
                    stick to their language &#38; old customs, &#38;, it must be added, to their money, with a
                    somewhat dubious devotion. An infusion<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03338.002.jpg"
                        type="verso"/> of American generosity &#38; freedom would do them great good. As it
                    is, <hi rend="underline">Methodism &#38;
                        money-making</hi> is the formula of the lives of most of them,&#8212;their
                    redeeming quality being their love of music &#38; oratory!</p>
                <p>I found the change here from Paris very striking. The French are exactly opposite in
                    every way,&#8212;those who live in Paris at any rate. There the sunshine &#38; the
                    gaiety &#38; general friendliness are very pleasantly in contrast with the grey skies &#38;
                    the somewhat
                    <choice>    
                        <sic>montonous</sic>  
                        <corr>monotonous</corr>
                    </choice> routine of London. Paris is a sort of ideal New York,&#8212;a New York
                    touched with Romance &#38; the finer graces of the Past, but without the youthful
                    ardency that pulses in Mannahatta. Paris would delight you greatly, I know, though
                    you might have misgivings at last about a life so frivolously secular, so wanting
                    (as it seemed to me) in humane &#38; religious aims of the higher kind. But this
                    notwithstanding, the charm of those sunny streets, &#38; good-natured 
                    irresponsible faces, is something to
                    remember.</p>
                <p>The Exhibition, I daresay, you have heard enough of. What struck me most of
                    all&#8212;much more than the Eiffel Tower &#38; other nine-days wonders, was the endless
                    cosmopolitan ebb &#38; flow of the peoples of the world,&#8212;American, Arabian,
                    Japanese, Indian, Egyptian, English, Norse:&#8212;a wonderful, indescribable <hi
                        rend="underline">Concourse de Monde</hi>!</p>
                <p>I must stop here to-day&#8212;Post-time!&#8212;hoping to take up the story at greater
                    length shortly. Luck has been dead against me of late. I suppose I shall have to
                    turn Quarry-man
