            <p> Good news! The book on you <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I had been contemplating
                for some years is coming bravely to the birth.<ptr target="loc.02893_n1"/> It has
                burst from me as from a ripe pomegranate its seeds, come from me with throes. I have
                been 2 weeks in a fever of parturition &#38; have gone over all the notes writings,
                &#38; literature of my past life in relentless search for material to enrich the book on my hero. (It ought to be studded with jewels
                &#38; written on gold &#38; silver in <choice>

            <p> I have spent two days unearthing the Oliver Stevens matter.<ptr
                    target="loc.02893_n2"/> I find Oliver to be a capital Pfaafian fellow, generous
                &#38; free &#38; entirely innocent&#8212;a mere cat's paw for others. I have
                discovered the real instigator, &#38; it forms a very pretty piece of business. I am
                going to put him in the stocks for all time. </p>
            <p> I am working out the grouping &#38; laws of <choice>

            <p> But my chief object is to propagandize. I am going to address the <hi
                    rend="underline">American People</hi> (not the damned &#38; twice damned
                literary &#38; clerical rascals). It's my firm belief that if these scoundrels could

                    <expan>could</expan>
                </choice> reach the people&#8212;your true audience. I have constructed a chain of

                </choice> rank in the Valhalla of great men, which I am going to present in a
                temperate, calm &#38; persuasive way. Then in Part II, I make an analysis of the
                poems &#38; all their vast implications &#38; ancillary topics: this <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02893.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Part will of

                hope you will not be displeased, &#38; also hope my time will not be taken up but
                that I can finish it soon. But I am going to read widely and deeply for it. Dr.
                    Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> book's is invaluable, but it lacks profundity<ptr
                    target="loc.02893_n3"/> &#38; literary knack in its treatment of the work
                (analysis) &#38; estimate of the problems involved. In fact I find it quite
                inadequate in these respects. </p>
