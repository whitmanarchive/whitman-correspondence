            <p>I am so much occupied with the meter<ptr target="loc.07230_n2"/> and a lot of other things including work on our 
                W. W. book<ptr target="loc.08152_n2"/> that I can not write as often as I sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> like—but you will 
                be far away wrong if you think there is any other reason
                for my comparative silence. But something has gone wrong with the Smiths<ptr target="loc.08165_n3"/> and I may as well tell you first as last.
                Neither they nor the Costelloes<ptr target="n7006"/> have asked me<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_zs.00458.jpg" type="verso"/> to visit them and when I dined
                at the Costelloes on Friday and gave Mrs C. your messages to her and the Smiths she never answered me and never asked
                a question about you. But do not let all this worry you, dear Walt,—there are a few of us left and we will
                be a legion when the right time comes. <hi rend="underline">My</hi> only feeling in the matter is one of intense curiousity.
                <hi rend="underline">Why</hi> sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> they shift about in this weathercock fashion? At Bolton I saw a letter from Mr Smith<ptr target="loc.08163_n3"/>
                to Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_zs.00459.jpg" type="recto"/> thanking J. for his "notes"<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/> and 
                in that letter he expressed himself
                as being very much your friend. Why should he write to J. that way if he had ceased to be your friend? J. is a stranger
                to Mr. S &amp; he had no temptation as far as I can see, to pretend anything to him. I have had some talk with H. B. Forman<ptr target="n0240"/>
                (I am writing from his home) on the subject. (F. is your friend through &amp; through) &amp; he thinks that
                <hi rend="underline">Mrs S.</hi><ptr target="loc.08163_n4"/> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Mr</hi> Costelloe<ptr target="loc.08163_n5"/> 
                are responsible for the coolness—be this
                as it may the coolness itself is a solid fact. I have not so far accomplished anything in meter matters but the parties who
                are looking into it seem much interested—I may do something yet before I leave England or I may only pave the way for future business.
                Give my love to Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> and say to him that I will write him soon.—My trip is agreeing with me and I am as well and hearty
                as possible</p>
