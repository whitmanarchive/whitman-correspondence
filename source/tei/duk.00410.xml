            <p>Somehow I was always under the impression that the picture we have had so long was
                Jessie's which occassioned the demand for a photo of Manhatta.<ptr
                    target="duk.00410_n1"/> The picture of Jessie<ptr target="n1055"/> which you
                propose to send us, will compose the twain, and we shall not need one of Manhatta:
                I like that name! and my enthusiasm was rekindled in a very lively degree by the presence of these two
                blooming girls greeting me so warmly, calling me "Uncle Charlie" &#8212; I had just
                returned from a <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="duk.00410.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                second visit to the Adirondacks the day after they
                arrived. Han was sick &#8212; very sick. I doubt that she will ever be hale and strong, or normal again. 
                She thinks that, if she could make you a
                visit, and have a good long rest, she would be restored. You could suggest to her
                that, if at any time she would like to make you a visit, you would be prepared to
                recieve her: If, for the time, you could furnish a couple of rooms. It may be
                necessary. I had a talk with Dr Lund<ptr target="duk.00396_n1"/> lately: he thought
                it would be beneficial to write to her. Continue the Phila Press: visit the
                Progress. dont need it. George<ptr target="n0700b"/> sent word that she should come,
                at any time, and remain with him as long as she desired.</p>
