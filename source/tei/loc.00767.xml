               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A letter from Jeff came this morning<ptr target="loc.00767_n1"/>&#8212;mother, I was sorry to hear you had a return of your rheumatism&#8212;I do hope you will favor yourself more, it depends so much on that&#8212;&amp; rheumatism is so obstinate, when it gets hold of one.</p>
            <p>Mother, you rec'd a letter from me, sent last Wednesday, 22d.<ptr target="loc.00767_n2"/> of course, with a small quantity of shinplasters. Next time you or Jeff writes, I wish you would tell me whether the letters come pretty regularly, <hi rend="italic">the next morning after I write them</hi>&#8212;this now ought to reach you Wednesday forenoon, April 29th. Mother, did a Mr. Howell call on you?&#8212;he was here last week to see about his boy, died a long while ago in hospital in Yorktown. He works in the Navy Yard&#8212;knows Andrew. You will see about him, (the boy,) in a letter I sent yesterday to the Eagle&#8212;it ought to appear to-day or to-morrow.<ptr target="loc.00767_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>Jeff, I wish you would take 10 cts I send in this letter &amp; get me ten copies of the Eagle with it in&#8212;put in 5 more of my pictures, (the big ones in last edition "Leaves"), &amp; a couple of the photographs carte visites (the smaller ones,) &amp; send me to the same direction as before. Jeff, I wish you would do up the parcel same as before, it came very well. I will send an Eagle to Han and George. The stamps &amp; 10 cts. are for Jeff, for the papers, &amp; postage.</p>
            <p>I have written to Han, &amp; sent her George's last two letters from Kentucky, one I got last week from Mount Sterling. I write to George, &amp; send him papers. Sam Beatty<ptr target="loc.00767_n4"/> is here in Washington again, I saw him, &amp; he said he would write to George. Mother, I have not got any new clothes yet, but shall very soon I hope. People are more rough and free &amp; easy drest than your way. Then it is dusty or muddy most of the time here.</p>
            <p>Mother dear, I hope you have comfortable times&#8212;at least as comfortable as the law allows&#8212;I am so glad you are not going to have the trouble of moving this 1st of May. How are the Browns?<ptr target="loc.00767_n5"/> Tell Will I should like to see him first rate&#8212;if he was here, attached to the suite of some big officer, or something of that kind, he would have a good time &amp; do well. I see lots of young fellows not half as capable &amp; trustworthy as he, coming &amp; going, in Washington, in such positions. The big generals &amp; head men, all through the armies, &amp; provosts &amp;c like to have a squad of such smart nimble young men around them. Give my respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown.</p>
            <p>Tell Jeff I am going to write to Mr. Lane, either to-day or to-morrow.<ptr target="loc.00767_n6"/> Jeff asks me if I go to hospitals as much as ever. If my letters home don't show it, you don't get 'em. I feel sorry sometimes after I have sent them, I have said so much about hospitals, &amp; so mournful. O mother, the young man in Armory Square, Dennis Barrett,<ptr target="loc.00767_n7"/> in the 169th N. Y., I mentioned before, is probably going to get up after all&#8212;he is like one saved from the grave. Saturday last I saw him &amp; talked with him &amp; gave him something to eat, &amp; he was much better&#8212;it is the most unexpected recovery I have yet seen.</p>
            <p>Mother, I see Jeff says in the letter you don't hear from me very often&#8212;I will write oftener especially to Jeff. Dear brother, I hope you are getting along good &amp; in good spirits. You must not mind the failure of the sewer bills, &amp;c. &amp;c.<ptr target="loc.00767_n8"/> It don't seem to me it makes so much difference about worldly successes (beyond just enough to eat &amp; drink, and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the last four months of my life especially, &amp; that merely to <hi rend="italic">live</hi>, &amp; have one fair meal a day, is <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>&#8212;but then you have a family, &amp; that makes a difference.</p>
            <p>Matty, I send you my best love, dear sister&#8212;how I wish I could be with you one or two good days. Mat, do you remember the good time we had that awful stormy night we went to the opera, New York, &amp; had the front seat, &amp; heard the handsome-mouthed Guerrabella?<ptr target="loc.00767_n9"/> And then the good oyster supper at Fulton Market&#8212;("pewter them ales"&#8212;) O, Mat, I hope &amp; trust we shall have such times again.</p> 
            <p>Tell Andrew he must remember what I wrote about the throat, &amp;c. I am sure he will get all right before long, &amp; recover his voice. Give him my love&#8212;&amp; tell Mannahatta her Uncle Walt is living now among the sick soldiers. Jeff, look out for the Eagles, &amp; send the portraits. Dearest mother, I must bid you &amp; all for the present good bye.</p>
