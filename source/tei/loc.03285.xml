                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I intended to call over &amp; see you yesterday when I was in Philadelphia, but I
                was unexpectedly detained by one man and forced to go to Washington so as to reach
                here last night. </p>
            <p> I will call on you on my way back to New York. </p>
            <p> But I write now to tell you why, because my visit will be on business </p>
            <p> I believe you have never met Mr Rice,<ptr target="n6004"/> proprietor of the North American Review, <choice>
                    <abbr>altho'</abbr>
                    <expan>although</expan>

                Editor may have written to you in his name, as he always does, even when Mr Rice is
                in Europe. It is at <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03285.002_large.jpg"

                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03285.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Mr Rice's
                instance that I will call on you. </p>
            <p> He has conceived the plan of procuring a collection of papers that, united in one
                volume, will be a permanent memorial of Lincoln. He has set about to secure the
                Reminiscences of <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the eminent Americans who came into
                personal relations with him&#8212;each man to tell his story, whether it shall be
                short or long. </p>
            <p> That's what he calls his <hi rend="underline">Lincoln Series</hi>. Some of these
                papers he may publish in the North American Review, &amp; others in the North
                American Review Syndicate: a group of influential papers which he supplies &#38; that
                publish simultaneously articles from famous men whom ordinarily newspapers cannot
                reach&#8212;nor afford to pay separately even if they did reach them. All the
                articles that you see marked "Copyright" <pb xml:id="leaf002v"

                civil history of the civil war&#8212;legislation, &amp;c. </p>
            <p> He wants me to see you &amp; ask you to write a paper on your experiences of the
                Civil War&#8212;the hospital life, &amp; other phases that you witnessed &amp; have
                not yet described. </p>
            <p> Could you write an article giving your recollections of Lincoln and also your
                memories of the War? Short or long it will be gladly accepted &amp; <hi
                    rend="underline"><choice><sic>liberaly</sic><corr>liberally</corr></choice></hi> paid for. He will take it, whether it is a page
                or a hundred pages </p>
            <p> I shall be here a week. I suppose I shall have no difficulty in finding the good
                grey poet in Camden. </p>
