            <p>I have no news at all to write this time&#8212;I have not heard any thing of the 51st since I last wrote you, &amp; about the general war news only what you see in the papers&#8212;Grant is gradually getting nearer &amp; nearer to Richmond&#8212;Many [here] anticipate that should Grant go into Richmond, Lee will make a side movement &amp; march up west, into the north, either to attempt to strike Washington, or to go again into Pennsylvania&#8212;I only say if that should happen, I for one shall not be dissatisfied so very much&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, how are you getting along home&#8212;how do you feel in health these days, dear mother&#8212;I hope you are well &amp; in good heart yet&#8212;I remain pretty well, my head begins to trouble me a little with a sort of fulness, as it often does in the hot weather&#8212;Singular to relate the 1st Mass artillery boy, Charles Cutter, is still living, &amp; may get well&#8212;I saw him this morning&#8212;I am still around among wounded same, but will not make you feel blue by filling my letter with sad particulars&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am writing this in Willard's hotel, hurrying to catch this afternoon's mail&#8212;Mother, do you get your letters now next morning, as you ought? I got a letter from the Post Master of Brooklyn about it&#8212;he said if the letters were neglected again to send him word&#8212;I have not heard from home now in some days&#8212;I am going to put up a lot of my old things in a box &amp; send them home by express, I will write when I send them&#8212;Have you heard any thing from Mary or Han lately&#8212;I should like to hear&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tell Jeff he must write, &amp; you must too, Mother&#8212;I have been in one of the worst hospitals all the forenoon, it contains about 1600&#8212;I have given the men pipes &amp; tobacco, (I am the only one that gives them tobacco)&#8212;O how much good it does some of them&#8212;the chaplains &amp; most of the doctors are down upon it&#8212;but I give them &amp; let them smoke&#8212;to others I have given oranges, fed them, &amp;c&#8212;well, dear mother, good bye&#8212;love to Matty &amp; sis&#8212;</p>
