            <p>I suppose you must have heard from Ashton that I received Mr. Otto's letter,<ptr target="nyp.00197_n3"/> &amp; that I returned for answer that I would report myself to him on or about Tuesday 24th instant. During the week previous to 16th I was quite sick, but this week I am about as well as usual.</p>
            <p>I intend to leave here on Monday 23d&#8212;shall take the 8 o'clock morning train, which will probably arrive in Washington about 7 in the evening. William, if you could hear of a room, I wish you would engage it for me&#8212;if Gwinne<ptr target="nyp.00197_n4"/> has one, it would do&#8212;take the first good room you find, if any, irrespective of price&#8212;it would do for a week or so, any how&#8212;would like convenience for a fire, as I am susceptible to chill this winter.</p>
            <p>We got word yesterday by means of an exchanged prisoner, from my brother George, but only up to November 27&#8212;at that time he was at Danville, Virginia, in confinement with 350 other officers. We hear that he is full of fortitude &amp; even good nature, but like all the rest, starved, miserable &amp; naked, to the last degree.</p>
            <p>We are all well, home here. Last night another snow-storm, but fine &amp; sunshiny this morning&#8212;So far this winter, snow, rain, mud, melt, fog, with spells of sharp cold. I have received a letter from Charles Eldridge, from an island off in the sea, far beyond Boston. I suppose you got my letter of some ten days since. Nelly, I send you my love, &amp; hope you are well &amp; [in] good spirits. Farewell.</p>
