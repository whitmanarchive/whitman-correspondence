               <salute>Dear Friend</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>Your letter of Aug 26th reached me in due time.<ptr target="loc.00609_n2"/> I had began to think (<choice><sic>allmost</sic><corr>almost</corr></choice>) that you had forgotten me. Then I imagined that some press of work had prevented your writing me sooner. Well as for myself (And I have nothing <choice><sic>elese</sic><corr>else</corr></choice> to write about) I am at work on a Farm at present. And managing to save $30.00 per month. Considerable leisure time, entertaining Books, good company. My employer is at home but a very small portion of his time. Have enjoyed myself pretty well (Hard times when I cannot) considering that I am Just from so much excitement when compared with this. <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_00246.jpg" type="verso"/>Have been reading, Our Old Home (by Nathaniel Hawthorne,) Home and Abroad (by B. Taylor) Color Guard (by J. R. Hosmer) all light reading but entertaining, for news I have the Buffalo Express (daily). So you see dear friend that I am pretty well provided for. I should like very much to see you and be with you.</p>
            <p>Corry is a pretty rough place. Property is very valuable. it is the Junction of three R.R. Atlantic &amp; Great Western, Pa &amp; Erie and Oil Creek. Large Refineries, Saw Mills, <choice><orig>Manufactorys</orig><reg>Manufacturers</reg></choice> are located here and doing a flourishing Business. Lots with the stumps &amp; logs on are sold at the rate of $40.00 per foot.</p>
         <p>This winter I shall either learn a trade of go to <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_00247.jpg" type="recto"/>School, I shall be governed by circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Weather is very warm for this time of the season considerable rain has fallen lately but the weather is quite pleasant nevertheless.</p>
         <p>Seems to me you are about to leave Washington in its most pleasant season. I was <choice><sic>allmost</sic><corr>almost</corr></choice> delighted with the fall of the year in that climate.</p>
            <p><choice><sic>Dont</sic><corr>Don't</corr></choice> have any good pictures here. People are thinking more of money here than of Beauty.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I have disputes with the detested Copperheads. I treat them rather uncivilly. <choice><sic>Havent</sic><corr>Haven't</corr></choice> any special regard for them.</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_00248.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I hope you will write me a long letter. Your letter was very interesting to me&#8212;very valuable. Well Good Old Friend I must bid you good night.</p>
