            <p>&#8212;I have just had my dinner&#8212;roast beef, lima beans, graham-bread &amp; sweet butter, 
                with a cup of tea, &amp; some stewed cranberries&#8212;eat quite a good dinner, &amp; enjoyed it all. 
                I still consider myself getting along very well. O if <hi rend="underline">this</hi> only holds out, &amp; keeps on favorably, 
                even if ever so moderate &amp; slow&#8212;But I seem to have so many of these gleams that delude me 
                into thinking I am on the way to recovery, but soon cloud over again, &amp; let me back as bad as ever&#8212;But every time I feel pretty easy, I still keep thinking, <hi rend="underline">now</hi> 
                I am <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> going to get much better <hi rend="underline">this time</hi>
            </p>
            
            <p>Pete your short letter came to-day, written on the cars&#8212;dear son, come whenever you can&#8212;As I said on my postal card, if you were here this week, you would find me more like myself, 
                (with the exception of walking) than I have been for fourteen months&#8212;whether it will continue 
                or not, God only knows&#8212;but we will hope for the best. As I sit here writing to you to day, 
                it appears to me every way hopeful, &amp; likely that we shall yet have good times. 
                Every thing is quiet&#8212;rather lonesome. My little dog is stretched out on the rug 
                at full length, snoozing. He hardly lets me go a step without being close at my heels&#8212;follows me in my slow walks, &amp; stops or turns just as I do. We have had a most windy blustering 
                March, but it is pleasanter &amp; milder yesterday &amp; to-day&#8212;(I saw the new moon over my right 
                shoulder a week ago,&#8212;<hi rend="underline">of course</hi> a <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> sign 
                of good luck)&#8212;Will finish the letter &amp; send it to-morrow.

            <p>Pleasant &amp; bright weather&#8212;have been out on the side walk in front, once or twice, 
                with my shawl around me&#8212;walk slow &amp; quite feeble&#8212;have some spells of bad head-ache&#8212;Went by the West Philadelphia depot yesterday afternoon, in the Market st. horse-cars&#8212;saw plenty of RR men &amp; conductors, about the place, lounging &amp; waiting their time&#8212;thought if I could only see <hi rend="underline">you</hi> among them&#8212;As I sit here writing I can see the trains 
                of the Camden &amp; Amboy, in full view, some 40 or 50 rods off&#8212;makes it quite lively&#8212;As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable, &amp; am going out awhile after I finish this&#8212;but had a bad night last night. Hope this will find you all right&#8212;good bye for this time, dear son.</p>
