            <p>I feel as if this beautiful spring morning here in England must send you greetings
                through me.<!--<ptr target="n0259"/>--> Our sunny little mound of garden, which runs down
                toward the south, is fragrant with hyacinths and wall-flowers (beautiful, tawny,
                reddish, yellow fellows laden with rich perfume)&#8212;and at the bottom is a big
                old cherry tree&#8212;one mass of snowy blossom; in a neighbour's gay garden &#38;
                beyond is a distant glimpse of some tall elms just putting on their first tender
                green: our little breakfast room where I always sit of a morning opens with glass
                doors into this garden. Herby<!--<ptr target="n0262"/>--> is gone with the "Sunday Tramps,"
                of whom he is a member, for a ten or fifteen-mile walk. Said tramps are some half
                dozen friends &#38; neighbours, some of them very learned professors but genial good
                fellows withal, who agree to spend every other Sunday morning in taking one of their
                long walks together&#8212;&#38; a very good time they have. Giddy<!--<ptr
                    target="n0890"/>--> is gone to hear a lecture; our bonnie Scotch girl is roasting
                the beef for dinner, singing the while in the kitchen; and pussy &#38; I are sitting
                very companionable &#38; meditative in the little room before described.</p>

            <p>You cannot think, dear friend, what a pleasure it was to have a whole big letter from
                you (not that I despise Postcards&#8212;they are good stop-gaps, but not the real
                thing). Yes, I have &#38; prize the article on the Hebrew Scriptures. How I wish you
                could make up your mind to spend your summer holiday with us.</p>

            <p>I am still struggling along, striving to say something which, if I can say it to my
                mind, will be useful&#8212;will clear away a little of the rubbish that hides you from
                men's eyes. I hear the "Eminent Women Series"<!--<ptr target="n3084"/>--> is having quite a
                large sale in America. Good-bye. Love to Mrs. Whitman. Greetings to your
                    brother.<!--<ptr target="n1046"/>--> Love from us all to you.</p>
