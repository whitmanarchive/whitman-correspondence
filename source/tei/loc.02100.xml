            </opener>

            <p>The second copy of "November Boughs" reached me by post this morning; and a few lines
                are due to you to let you know its safe arrival. It is a great pleasure to me to
                receive it. I did particularly want it with your writing in it, and shall always
                read</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02100.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>from this copy and value it highly. I did not say anything of its absence from the
                big parcel<ptr target="loc.02100_n1"/>, because I supposed there was some good
                reason, &#38; knew I had much more anyway than I deserved. I shall keep the extra
                phototype portrait when you have placed it in the "Sands."</p>

            <p>Miss Louisa Drewry,</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02100.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>the lady whose paper I told you of in my last<ptr target="loc.02100_n2"/>, called
                here yesterday to see the various editions of your books, and the portraits I have
                of you. She is a thoroughly intelligent appreciator &#38; sees something of the
                magnitude of L. of G. She has carried off Mrs. Gilchrist's<ptr target="n0259"/>
                papers on you to read (Herbert's<ptr target="n0262"/> book).</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02100.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>You will probably hear from her, as she fancies to get some books you distribute
                yourself.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Yours always in affectionate respect</salute>
