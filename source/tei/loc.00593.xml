         <p>You will find the article you sent will be in the Times of this morning, when it is published. I<ptr target="loc.00593_n100"/> have crowded out a great many things to get it in, and it has taken the precedence of army correspondence and articles which have been waiting a month for insertion. It is excellent&#8212;the first part and the closing part of it especially. I am glad to see you are engaged in such good work at Washington. It must be even more refreshing than to sit by Pfaff's privy<ptr target="loc.00593_n2"/> and eat sweet-breads and drink coffee, and listen to the intolerable wit of the crack-brains. I happened in there the other night, and the place smelt as atrociously as ever. Pfaff looked as of yore. I read your article in proof and hope it's all accurate enough. "The field large&#8212;the reapers few" is the finest paragraph. Everything in New York moves on pretty much as usual. It's the old town&#8212;only different.</p>
            <p>My brother William<ptr target="loc.00593_n3"/> sailed for Port Royal ten days ago&#8212;to be present at the attack on Charleston&#8212;if it is to be attacked.<ptr target="loc.00593_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>Do you know Conway of Kansas?<ptr target="loc.00593_n5"/> He is a good man If you don't know him, and if he would be of any service to you in any way, I know he would be rejoiced to serve you, if you mentioned my name to him.</p>
            <p>The article has some things in that I could recognize you by, but not many. I like it better on that account than I should otherwise.&#8212;Hoping that Vicksburg may soon fall.</p>
