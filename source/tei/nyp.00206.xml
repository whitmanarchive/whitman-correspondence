            <p>By Mother's letter I have heard about the moving &amp; the new quarters&#8212;Mother says that she is glad they are no worse, under all the circumstances. I enclose an envelope to mother, with a little money in it. As you see, I am still in the same place, with easy times enough, &amp; a good place as I could expect. The Attorney General<ptr target="nyp.00206_n2"/> is absent now in Kentucky. There is not much work. I can't tell whether I shall keep on here, or not. There is nothing at present that looks like a change&#8212;I feel quite well this spring&#8212;but a clerk's life here is not very interesting&#8212;I went down last Thursday to Mt Vernon, 16 miles down the Potomac&#8212;I think it is the pleasantest spot &amp; farm I ever saw&#8212;went through the house &amp; grounds &amp;c&#8212;I was very glad I went&#8212;Yesterday we had the funeral here of a man you must have seen mentioned in the papers, old Count Gurowski. I have been very well acquainted with him since I have lived here&#8212;he was a strange old man, a great lord in his own country, Poland, owned 30,000 serfs &amp; great estates&#8212;an exile for conspiring against the government&#8212;he knew every thing &amp; growled &amp; found fault with everybody&#8212;but was always very courteous to me, &amp; spoke very highly of me in his book, his "Diary," printed last winter&#8212;his funeral was simple but very impressive&#8212;all the big radicals were there<ptr target="nyp.00206_n3"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>The fight between Congress &amp; the President is still going on&#8212;I think the President is rather afraid of going too far against Congress, for Stevens &amp; the rest of 'em are very determined.<ptr target="nyp.00206_n4"/>

            <p>My hospitals are dwindled down to a small force&#8212;but there are plenty of cases to occupy me a couple of visits a week&#8212;I always go Sunday, &amp; sometimes in the middle of the week&#8212;Julius Mason<ptr target="nyp.00206_n5"/> is here in barracks yet&#8212;Jeff, I wish I could now &amp; then be home &amp; see you all, even if was only a couple of hours&#8212;</p>
            <p>Give my best respects to Mr. Lane,<ptr target="nyp.00206_n6"/> and the Doctor<ptr target="nyp.00206_n7"/>&#8212;I send my love to Mat<ptr target="nyp.00206_n8"/> &amp; the little girls.<ptr target="nyp.00206_n9"/> Write &amp; tell me all about home affairs, &amp; how George<ptr target="nyp.00206_n10"/> is getting along&#8212;dear old Mother, as she gets older &amp; older, I think about her every day &amp; night&#8212;</p>
