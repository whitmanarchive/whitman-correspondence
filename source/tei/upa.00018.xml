        <salute>Dearest friend,<ptr target="n0259"/></salute>
      </opener>

      <p>To your good &amp; comforting letter of Feb. 25th<ptr target="upa.00018_n1"/> I at once
        answer, at least with a few lines. I have already <choice><orig>to&#8211;day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice> written (answering one just <choice><orig>rec'd</orig><reg>received</reg></choice> from him) a pretty long letter to Mr Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/>, &amp; requested him to loan it to
        you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully &amp; candidly.</p>

      <p>My new edition is printed &amp; ready. On receipt of your letter I have mailed you a set,
        two <choice><orig>vols.</orig><reg>volumes</reg></choice>, which you ought to have <choice><orig>rec'd</orig><reg>received</reg></choice> by this time. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.</p>

      <p>My health I am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better&#8212;certainly as well as any
        time of late. I even already vaguely contemplate plans, (they may never be fulfilled, but
        yet again they may,) of changes, journeys&#8212;even of coming to London, of seeing you, of
        visiting my friends, &amp;c. </p>

      <p>My dearest friend, I do not approve your American trans&#8211;settlement<ptr
          target="upa.00018_n2"/>&#8212;I see so many things here, you have yet no idea of&#8212;the
        American social &amp; almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, (at least in
        appearance)&#8212;Don't do any thing toward such a move, nor resolve on it, nor indeed make
        any move at all in it, without further advice from me. If I should get well enough to
        voyage, we will talk about it yet in London&#8212;You must not be uneasy about me&#8212;dear
        friend, I get along much better than you suppose. As to my literary situation here, my
        rejection by the coteries&#8212;&amp; my poverty, (which is the least of my
        troubles)&#8212;I am not sure but I enjoy them all. Besides, as to the latter, I am not in
        want. Best love to you, &amp; to your children. </p>
