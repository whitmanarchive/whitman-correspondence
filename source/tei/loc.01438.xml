                <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>The enclosed announcement will give you the particulars of a series which we have in
                hand, and expect soon to begin the publication of.</p>

            <p>We write now in hopes of securing your co-operation in the work.</p>

            <p>We understand that you have one or more lectures on Lincoln, and have beside a
                quantity of available material. Would you be willing to furnish us a volume not to
                exceed sixty thousand words? We would leave the treatmenet of the subject entirely
                to your best judgment, so that you might present Lincoln from any point of view that
                seems to you particularly affective. The details of his life have of course been
                done at great length.</p>

            <p>We think that such a volume as we propose from your pen would attract very wide
                attention.</p>

            <p>We are paying the authors in this series ten per cent of the retail price of all
                books sold. But if you would prefer a lump sum instead of the copyright, we should be
                happy to pay you Five hundred ($500) Dollars for such a volume as we outline, on
                receipt of the manuscript from you.</p>

            <p>Trusting that the idea may stike you favorably, and that we may have an answer in the
                affirmative, we are,</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
                <signed>Dodd, Mead &#38; Company</signed>
