            <p>I have yours 28 Feb. and 1 March enclosing John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/>
                of 27 Feb.<ptr target="loc.07342_n1"/> and the funny little wood cut. So you have
                become immortal in a cigar advertisement!!<ptr target="loc.07342_n2"/> Well done! I always thought you would
                come to something if you stuck to your business long enough! Burroughs' letter is
                deeply interesting&#8212;but what ails the fellow that he is so damned pathetic? He
                is (I judge) fairly well fixed (as things go)&#8212;good reputation, lovely home,
                enough to eat &#38;c. &#38;c. then why is he so infernally down in the mouth all the
                time? I don't see anything to whine about in getting old&#8212;think (on the whole)
                it is rather a good joke&#8212;my strongest feeling
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00728.jpg" type="verso"/>
            about it is: what is to come next? That we are going to (or towards) the bad all the
                time does not occur to me as likely at all and if not what is there to be blue
                about? I have just received and answered the enclosed long letter from Mrs O'Connor<ptr target="n4137"/>
                which I am sure you would like to read&#8212;you need not return it. I have some
                notion that I may take a week's run about middle of April to Philadelphia, Baltimore
                and Washington. I shall look out for the May Century with considerable interest.<ptr target="loc.07342_n3"/> We
                are pegging away at the meter<ptr target="loc.07230_n2"/> trying to get it on its feet and I look to succeed all
                in good time but it will take weeks perhaps months yet</p>
