            <p>You will, no doubt be surprised, when you see the signature to this letter, but. I
                have often been tempted to write you&#8212;to thank you for your kindness in writing
                to my boy<ptr target="loc.04506_n2"/>&#8212;far away in the Sierra Madre mountains&#8212;and</p>

                correspondents&#8212;and have also suffered from extreme indisposition, he has
                appreciated particularly your thought of him&#8212;&#38; been much
                pleased&#8212;&#38; his mother also shares with him the same feeling&#8212;</p>

            <p>I received a letter from John today&#8212;in which he mentions having heard from you
                &#38; that he had received a card also&#8212;he has had an attack of
                Pneumonia&#8212;his first sickness since he has been out there&#8212;and, is much
                weakened by it&#8212;and. I realise how very far away he is&#8212;and feel anxious
                about him&#8212;</p>
