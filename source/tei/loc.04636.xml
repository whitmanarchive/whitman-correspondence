            <p>You will, no doubt be surprised, when you see the signature to this letter, but. I
                have often been tempted to write you—to thank you for your kindness in writing
                to my boy<ptr target="loc.04636_n3"/>—far away in the Sierra Madre
                mountains—and <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02472.jpg" type="verso"/>
                always gladly welcoming any letters from his old home—and, especially from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>—who have <hi rend="underline">so</hi> many
                correspondents—and have also suffered from extreme indisposition, he has
                appreciated particularly your thought of him—&amp; been much
                pleased—&amp; his mother also shares with him the same feeling—</p>
            <p>I have once or twice learned, thro' the papers, of your ill health—with much
                regret and, we are always interested when we see your <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02473.jpg" type="recto"/> name—in print—</p>
            <p>I received a letter from John today—in which he mentions having heard from you
                &amp; that he had received a card also—he has had an attack of
                Pneumonia—his first sickness since he has been out there—and, is much
                weakened by it—and. I realise how very far away he is—and feel anxious
                about him—</p>
            <p>I will not trespass further on your time but hope you are <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02474.jpg" type="verso"/> regaining your strength and much
                    improved—Alice<ptr target="loc.04636_n4"/> unites with me in very kind
                remembrances—</p>
