               <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your letters from Washington have all reached me, with the others enclosed. The last from you was dated Sept 27. You did not mention William in it&#8212;I should always like to hear about him &amp; from him. Is Nelly in Boston? If so say I sent my best love, not forgetting little Jennie. The last letter I received from Nelly was from Little Compton Aug 18&#8212;I have written subsequently &amp; directed there, which I suppose she received&#8212;I have not heard from her since&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am pretty well, perhaps not so unconsciously hearty as before my sickness&#8212;We are deprest in spirits home here about my brother George, (2d div 9th Corps)&#8212;if not killed, he is a prisoner&#8212;he was in the engagement of Sept 30 on the extreme left.31</p>
            <p>My book is not yet being printed. I still wish to stereotype it myself. I could easily still put it in the hands of a proper publisher then, &amp; make better terms with him.</p>
            <p>If you write to William I wish you to enclose him this letter&#8212;I wish him to receive again my faithful friendship&#8212;while breath &amp; sense remain I cannot forget what he has been to me&#8212;I love him dearly&#8212;</p>
            <p>The weather here is fine of late&#8212;to-day a little blowy&#8212;The political meetings in New York &amp; Brooklyn are immense&#8212;I go to them as to shows, fireworks, cannon, clusters of gaslights, countless torches, banners &amp; mottos, 15, 20, 50,000 people&#8212;Per contra I occasionally go riding off in the country, in quiet lanes, or a sail on the water, &amp; many times to the sea shore at Coney Island&#8212;</p>
            <p>All the signs are that Grant is going to strike forthwith, perhaps risk all&#8212;One feels solemn who sees what depends. The military success, though first-class of war, is the least that depends&#8212;</p>
            <p>Good bye, dearest comrade, write me whenever you can&#8212;if I make any move I shall let you know&#8212;</p>
