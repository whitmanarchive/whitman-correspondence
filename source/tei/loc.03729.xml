            </opener>
            <p>It is after much hesitation that I venture at last to write these few words. Indeed
                for mine own sake I would not trouble you at all, but "The love of comrades" prompts
                me to do it cheerfully and willingly.</p>
            <p>Being a humble though ardent lover of the "Good Grey Poet"
                I was of course present to hear Mr Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> lecture in
                the Horticultural Hall, Philad<hi rend="underline">a</hi>.<ptr target="loc.03729_n3"/>
                Writing to a fellow admirer of Leaves of Grass, in England I described as best I
                could the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03729.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> visit
                and the lecture, the gaining of an object which we had both long wished for—a
                sight of the Hero whom we jointly worshipped.</p> 

            <p>Sometime after this when the lecture was printed my friend saw a copy and read it
                himself with much pleasure. The words, "Wreath the living brows," which act as a
                sort of keynote to the whole, gave the inspiration for the few well-wrought stanzas
                enclosed herewith. These he forwarded to me, asking if I would send them to him for
                whom they were written. And so I send them fully believing in their deep sincerity.
                In my humble opinion they would serve excellently as a heading to Mr Ingersoll's
                lecture:—</p>

                    What shall I add for mine own part? Is it possible
                    for me to say anything worth saying. When the heart is full language is poor to
                    express. I am but young yet seem to feel the pulse-beat of sympathy with life in
                    all its grand, mysterious, myriad phases changing ever and ever surging onward
                    all about me. The soul within me goes out to mingle with yours disclosed in your
