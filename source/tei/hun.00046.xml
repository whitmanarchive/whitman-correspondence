            </opener>
            <p>Do not suppose, because I have delayed writing to you, that I have forgotten
                you.&#8212;No, that will never be.&#8212;I often recall your visits to me, and your
                goodness.&#8212;I think profoundly of my friends&#8212;though I cannot write to them
                by the post office.&#8212;I write to them more to my satisfaction, through my
                poems.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tell Hector<ptr target="duk.00424_n18"/> I thank him heartily for his invitation and
                letter&#8212;O it is not from any mind to slight him that I have not answered it, or
                accepted the friendly call.&#8212;I am so non&#8211;polite&#8212;so habitually
                wanting in my responses and ceremonies.&#8212;That is <hi rend="underline"
                >me</hi>&#8212;much that is bad, harsh, an undutiful person, a thriftless debtor, is
                me.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I spent an evening with Mr. Arnold<ptr target="pml.00016_n7"/> and Mrs. Price<ptr
                    target="pml.00014_n2"/> lately.&#8212;Mrs. Price and Helen<ptr target="n4167"/>
                had been out all day with the sewing machine, at Mr. Beecher's<ptr
                    target="n0066"/>&#8212;either Henry Ward's, or his father's. <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="hun.00046.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> They had done a
                great day's work&#8212;as much, one of the Beecher ladies said, as a sempstress
                could have got through with in six months.&#8212;Mrs. P and Helen had engagements
                for a fortnight ahead, to go out among families and take the sewing
                machine.&#8212;What a revolution this little piece of furniture is
                producing.&#8212;Isn't it quite an <hi rend="underline"
                >encouragement</hi>.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I got into quite a talk with Mr. Arnold about Mrs. Hatch.<ptr target="hun.00046_n1b"
                />&#8212;He says the pervading thought of her speeches is that <hi rend="underline"
                    >first</hi> exists the spirituality of any thing, and <hi rend="underline"
                    >that</hi> gives existence to things, the earth, plants, animals, men,
                women.&#8212;But that Andrew Jackson Davis<ptr target="loc.01606_n1"/> puts <hi
                    rend="underline">matter</hi> as the subject of his homilies, and the primary
                source of all results&#8212;I suppose the soul among the rest.&#8212;Both are quite
                determined in their theories.&#8212;Perhaps when they know much more, both of them
                will be much less determined.&#8212;</p>
            <p>A minister, Rev. Mr. Porter,<ptr target="hun.00046_n10"/> was introduced to me this
                morning,&#8212;a Dutch Reformed minister, and editor of the "Christian
                Intelligencer," N.Y.&#8212;Would you believe it&#8212;he had been reading "Leaves of
                Grass," and wanted <hi rend="underline">more</hi>?&#8212;He said he hoped I retained
                the true Reformed faith which I must have inherited from my mother's Dutch
                ancestry.&#8212;I <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="hun.00046.003_large.jpg" type="recto"
                /> not only assured him of my retaining faith in that sect, but that I had perfect
                faith in all sects, and was not inclined to reject one single one&#8212;but believed
                each to be about as far advanced as it could be, considering what had preceded
                it&#8212;and moreover that every one was the needed representative of <hi
                    rend="underline">its</hi> truth&#8212;or of something needed as much as
                truth.&#8212;I had quite a good hour with Mr. Porter&#8212;we grew friends&#8212;and
                I am to go dine with the head man of the head congregation of Dutch Presbyterians in
                Brooklyn, Eastern District!</p>
            <p>I have seen Mrs. Walton<ptr target="n5001"/> once or twice since you left
                Brooklyn,&#8212;I dined there.&#8212;I feel great sympathy with her, on some
                accounts.&#8212;Certainly, she is not happy.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Fowler &#38; Wells<ptr target="loc.02340_n3"/> are bad persons for me.&#8212;They
                retard my book very much.&#8212;It is worse than ever.&#8212;I wish now to bring out
                a third edition&#8212;I have now <hi rend="underline">a hundred</hi> poems ready
                (the last edition had thirty&#8211;two.)&#8212;and shall endeavor to make an
                arrangement with some publisher here to take the plates <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="hun.00046.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> from F. &#38; W. and make the
                additions needed, and so bring out the third edition.&#8212;F. &#38; W. are very
                willing to give up the plates&#8212;they want the thing off their hands.&#8212;In
                the forthcoming vol. I shall have, as I said, a hundred poems, and no other matter
                but poems&#8212;(no letters to or from Emerson&#8212;no notices, or any thing of
                that sort.)&#8212;I know well enough, that <hi rend="underline">that</hi> must be
                the <hi rend="underline">true</hi> Leaves of Grass&#8212;I think it (the new vol.)
                has an aspect of completeness, and makes its case clearer.&#8212;The old poems are
                all retained.&#8212;The difference is in the new character given to the mass, by the
                additions.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear friend, I do not feel like fixing a day on which I will come and make my
                promised visit.&#8212;How it is I know not, but I hang back more and more from
                making visits even to those I have much happiness in being with.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother<ptr target="duk.00425_n3"/> is well&#8212;all are well.&#8212;Mother often
                speaks about you.&#8212;We shall all of us remember you always with more affection
                than you perhaps suppose.&#8212;Before I come to Philadelphia, I shall send you or
                Hector a line.&#8212;</p>
