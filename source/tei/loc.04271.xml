            </opener>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>Since Jeff's<ptr target="n0710"/> death I have been
                constantly thinking that there should be some proper obituary notice of him
                published in one of the engineering journals.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>At the time of the death of Moses Lane,<ptr
                target="duk.00438_n6"/> I found that the notices which I wrote brought forth
                others from his friends, and withal it was very satisfactory to his family and those
                to whom he was especially dear.</p>   
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>In Jeff's case, there is no one of us that knows enough
                of his early life to write a proper notice, in fact, there is no one that can do
                this with justice to his memory among us, save possibly Worthen,<ptr
                    target="loc.00429_n1"/> or Joe Davis,<ptr target="n0185"/> and we cannot hope
                for anything from them. Therefore, the thought has occurred to me that if you would
                write a notice that would take up say not over half a column <handShift
                    rend="manuscript"/>Publisher says you may take a whole column, <handShift
                    rend="typescript"/>(as it is very difficult, you know, in one of these
                engineering journals, to get more than this), if you would do this, I would attend
                to having it published in one of the engineering journals, and I know that it would
                be a very great satisfaction to his friends in the profession.<ptr target="loc.04271_n3"/></p>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>The death of Jeff has been a very great blow to me
                personally, as for a good many years I looked upon him as one of my warmest friends.
                Our association of the last four or five years has been constant, and very close,
                and I have learned to lean upon<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00444.jpg"
                    type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00445.jpg" type="recto"/> him
                in so many ways that I feel as though a prop were taken out of my life by his
                death.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>I am sorry to have to write you a machine letter now,
                but my crippled arm makes this a necessity.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>If you agree with me, and are willing <handShift
                    rend="manuscript"/>and strong enough<handShift rend="typescript"/> to furnish me
                the manuscript, I would suggest your doing it at once, as I shall be away from home
                after a few days, and besides that, it should be published as soon as possible.</p>
