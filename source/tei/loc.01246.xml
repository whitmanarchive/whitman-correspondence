            <p>After a splendid time in Ceylon &#38; India I have got back here again. Saw much of the interior 
                life of the people, religious customs, &#38;c&#8212;spent one night, or a good part of one, in a 
                Hindu Temple during a festival&#8212;saw a little of the peasantry &#38; their ways, and made 
                several friends among the natives. Altogether it is very interesting&#8212;the old occult knowledge 
                (some of a very remarkable character) lingering on among certain sections; then the
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01246.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                tremendous Westernising movement among other sections, towards education science, &#38; commercialism, 
                and away from caste &#38; religion; caste itself, such an intricate &#38; stupendous affair, impossible 
                to get to know more than the fringe of it; the evident rapprochement between The East &#38; The West, 
                and yet the deep &#38; vital differences between them, in temperament &#38; almost everything&#8212;altogether
                it has given me a lot to think about!</p>
            <p>I got a pamphlet from D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> of Bolton about his visit 
                to you<ptr target="loc.02495_n4b"/>&#8212;wh. I enjoyed&#8212;also a capital photograph. His account in the pamphlet and in a recent
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01246.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                letter about your health, dear Walt, is not very good&#8212;this long confinement to the house, together 
                with gastric troubles, must weary you at times&#8212;It does make such a difference when one can get 
                out&#8212;and yet there doesn't seem much difference in you, exc: quite outwardly.</p>
            <p>Some of us (Bessie &#38; Isabella Ford;<ptr target="loc.01238_n2"/> R.D. Roberts<ptr target="loc.01246_n2"/> of Cambridge; William, Arthur 
                &#38; Ethel Thompson;<ptr target="loc.01246_n1"/> and myself) are sending on to you our usual birthday 
                remembrance&#8212;with our love and unchanged affection (I think I may say). The letter of credit, enclosed, 
                is for &#163;40. I don't quite know what "identification" they require; but I don't think you will have any 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01246.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                difficulty about the matter.</p>
            <p>William Thompson is lately married &#38; is working a little at bookbinding for a trade. Arthur &#38; Ethel 
                are his brother &#38; sister, whom I know next to nothing of. The two Miss Fords have been down with influenza, 
                but are mending again I believe. Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> I hear is on Long Island.<ptr target="upa.00090_n2b"/>

                when you see them. I send you a bit of sweet briar wh. grows by the door of this little house. Our garden goes 
                on much the same, and all seems homelike &#38; pleasant after my long absence&#8212;the bees humming in the sun
                as if the world had only just begun! I hope you will have a pleasant birthday gathering, dear Walt&#8212;</p>
