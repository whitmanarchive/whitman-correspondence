                    Dear Walt,
                </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am often inclined to wish that you could have been with me today. As that is impossible I wish that I could
                give you word pictures of all I have seen. But I must content myself with the briefest hints &#38; suggestions.</p>
            <p>I arrived at Hungtington Station<ptr target="loc.08267_n3"/> &#64; 5. 57 last night, &#38; rode in traincar
                to village, putting up &#64; the Suffolk Hotel where you &#38; Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> stayed 10
                years ago. After supper I explored the main street a little&#8212;called in at the Library to see if I 
                could refer to a map of roads &#38;c.&#8212;borrowed the copy of "Specimen Days"<ptr target="n4121"/> you
                presented to the Library in 1883&#8212;called on Mr Funell (druggist) to ask particulars of 
                localities&#8212;got copies of the "Long Islander"<ptr target="loc.02524_n3"/> one of which I send to 
                you&#8212;&#38; arranged for

                buggy for today.</p>
            <p>At 8.30 this morning it came round&#8212;driven by an old man named Dodge&#8212;&#38;
                we drove to West Hills. I need not tell you how interesting the country was to me; nor do I need to 
                describe it. Mr. &#38; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Jarvis<ptr target="n5001"/> were very kind &#38; 
                courteous, &#38; showed me round the house. Then to the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> homestead. Apple 
                trees every where loaded heavily with fruit&#8212;apples lying in unheeded heaps on the ground. 
                So plentiful &#38; so cheap this year that it isn't worth while to send them off. And far
                more here than they know what to do with.</p>
            <p>Kindly received by M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Place<ptr target="n5001"/> with whom I sat a 
                little&#8212;looking in the old kitchen. Looked over the old farm lands,
                at the kitchen garden, the well, the dwelling
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01009_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                of your great grandfather (now used as a wagon-house &#38;c)&#8212;the grove of black walnuts&#8212;the
                grand old oak (shrunken of late years they say)&#8212;the orchard with its plentiful crop&#8212;&#38;c.</p>
            <p>I went up to the old burial ground &#38; sat there alone for about half an hour. The sky was rather 
                dull&#8212;but the clouds were high, the air clear, &#38; the temperature pleasant. A light breeze 
                sounded in the woods a low pensive rhythm&#8212;a distant cricket chirped&#8212;&#38; all else
                was silent&#8212;"graves under us <hi rend="underline">silent</hi>."<ptr target="loc.04402_n1"/></p>
            <p>Drove next to the top of Jaynes' Hill.&#8212;the great South Bay &#38; the beach beyond in sight to the 
                south&#8212;to the north the Channel &#38; the Connecticut Hills beyond&#8212;eastward the well wooded 
                undulating panorama of the Island with Dix Hills in the centre&#8212;westward woods &#38; woods beyond.<ptr target="loc.04402_n2"/></p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01010_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Then back just in time for dinner &#64; 12.30.</p>
            <p>At 1. 40 Dodge brought the buggy round again &#38; we drove to Cold Spring.<ptr target="loc.04402_n3"/> 
                The sun had come out &#38; a beautiful afternoon was granted us. We didn't know where to find the Velsor 
                burial ground &#38;c., so called at Warren P. Velsor's<ptr target="loc.04402_n5"/> to enquire. He referred us to his cousin
                "Charlie Velsor."<ptr target="n5001"/> He (WPV) knew you 50 years ago&#8212;attended your school&#8212;thought
                you boarded (while "boarding round") with his father, &#38; shared bed with him&#8212;&#38; asked me to give 
                you his best respects. He is a butcher&#8212;retains the Velsor love for horses&#8212;is a good horse doctor
                &#38; likes to keep a good horse himself&#8212;Drove on past the Harbor&#8212;up the hill through the woods, 
                past Charles H Jones',<ptr target="n5001"/> along the level road, then to the left along a lane with 
                snakefences on each side to "Charlie Velsor's. The old man came out &#38; was
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01011_large.jpg" type="recto"/>     
                extremely kind &#38; obliging. He offered to accompany us, &#38; as he was rather lame in one ankle I gave 
                him my seat in the buggy &#38; walked alongside. He attributed his lameness to the fact that his brother 
                "Lije"<ptr target="n5001"/> &#38; he used to be great "hoppers," &#38; rheumatiz
                had settled in his ankle since. He is in his 78<hi rend="underline">th</hi> year, but is wonderfully hale,
                active &#38; cute. He has a fine old face &#38; head &#38; reminded me of you in his nose &#38; ears. 
                Face shaven. He said he had been a strong man in his time, but had "got over it." He
                remembered taking you &#38; Dr. Bucke, &#38; wished that you could come again. He looked with interest &#38;
                pleasure at your portraits in L of G &#38; Dr Bucke's book<ptr target="loc.07194_n1"/> (As also did his 
                cousin, M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> &#38; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Jarvis &#38; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Place)</p>
            <p>Down the hill amongst the trees to the secluded valley below&#8212;a turn to the left across a narrow field&#8212;&#38; we
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01012_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                were at the foot of the burial hill.&#8212;Up through the bush &#38; we were in the burial ground 
                itself&#8212;surrounded by trees, secluded, still, simple, &#38; natural, with sunlit sky above. 
                Stood there about 20 minutes, looked for quite a time at your grandfather<ptr target="n7515b"/> &#38; grandmother's<ptr target="n7515"/> 
                graves, &#38; at the rest. ("No finer women ever walked this earth than the women of the Williams family"
                said &#38; repeated old C.V.)</p>
            <p>Then back to the buggy &#38; along to the Major's homestead. Foundations of house visible &#38; cellar still
                there&#8212;had quite large cherry trees growing in cellar &#38; in centre of Sitting Room. Big Ash tree 
                (now getting old) growing near front door. No traces left of barn, wagon-house &#38;c&#8212;the grain fields
                which were there on your visit in '81 also gone&#8212;the ground now planted with trees&#8212;smallish&#8212;mostly
                cedars. The valley very beautiful &#38; peaceful in the late afternoon light.
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01013_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I let the buggy get ahead of me, &#38; then turned up to the burial ground again to spend 5 minutes there
                alone. The ground itself shaded, the tops of the trees were bright in the sunlight, with beautiful sky
                above. The leaves rustled gently in the wind, &#38; all was peaceful &#38; sweet. I stopped at your
                grandmother's grave (&#8212;I could have loved her, &#38; even from description love her sweet
                memory&#8212;) &#38; plucked one or two small fronds of fern&#8212;(will enclose one for you.) Then walked 
                alone up the lane&#8212;the sunlight streaming through the trees&#8212;up to the house. Shook hands
                with the old man, who sent his regards to you, &#38; we drove back.</p>
            <p>It has been a blessed day to me&#8212;a true Sabbath&#8212;in many ways &#38; will be long memorable to me.</p>
               <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01014_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>And apart from all its old associations I can understand &#38; share your love for this beautiful country.
                I am glad to have seen it, even for a day, &#38; wish that I could explore it more fully. But its spirit 
                &#38; influence&#8212;inland &#38; on the coast&#8212;are embalmed in your book&#8212;&#38;
               <hi rend="underline">that</hi> at least I have.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow morning, if fine, I will drive over to Centreport to see Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/>&#8212;returning
                to Brooklyn in the evening.</p>
            <p>I think I had better spend 2 days in New York &#38; come to Camden on <hi rend="underline">Thursday</hi>.
                But I will write again. In any case Andrew Rome<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> will accompany me for the day.</p>
