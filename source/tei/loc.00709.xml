                    <handShift rend="manuscript"/> To Messrs. Beach, of the Sun: (through Mr.

            <p> The accompanying novel, of "The <hi rend="underline">Sleeptalker</hi>," I consider
                one of the most interesting, romantic, and full of incident, of any I have ever come
                across.&#8212;It is by the Danish novelist Ingemann,<ptr target="loc.00709_n3"/> a better writer even than Miss
                Bremer.<ptr target="loc.00709_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p> The work from which I have compiled "<hi rend="underline">the Sleeptalker</hi>" is
                an English translation, (I send you the cover and title page,) whose only fault
                    <del>it</del> was, that it was too voluminous, the author going very extensively
                into the details of old Danish history.&#8212;This I have altogether cut out;
                reducing the work to half its first size.&#8212;It has never been republished in
                this country, and is altogether unknown here.&#8212;</p>
            <p> The romance is a stirring and lively one, and it seems to me fitted to become very
                popular.&#8212;</p>
            <p> I take the liberty of leaving it for you to look at, to see if I could dispose of it
                for serial publication in "The Sun."&#8212;</p>

            <p> I desire but a moderate price.&#8212;After running through the Sun, it seems to me
                it would pay handsomely to print it in a neat 25 cent book form.&#8212;</p>
            <p> You will see that the title of the original is "The childhood of Erik Menved"; the
                latter part of the <add place="above">original</add> story, consisting very much of
                    <sic>prolic</sic><corr>prolix</corr> detail of historical events, gives it that
                name&#8212;but that part of the story I have contracted into a few paragraphs&#8212;and have taken a singular trait of one of the principal actors in the
                narrative as the foundation of the name I give it.&#8212;</p>
            <p> Please, if convenient, make up your minds whether it would suit you, and how much it
                would be worth to you, so that I can have an answer by the middle or latter part of
                the week.&#8212;</p>
            <p> The story would make about 65 leaded <add place="above">short</add> columns of the
                Sun&#8212;so that, at an average of 3 columns a day it would run through 22 days.&#8212;</p>
