I want to hear all about it&#8212;If you get this you must write to me, Thu, you need not mind ceremony&#8212;there is no need of ceremony between dear friends for that I hope we are, my loving boy, for all the difference in our ages.</p>
            <p>There is nothing new with me here&#8212;I am very well in health &amp; spirits, &amp; only need some employment, clerkship or something, at fair wages to make things go agreeable with me&#8212;no, there is one thing more I need &amp; that is Thuey, for I believe I am quite a fool, I miss you so.<ptr target="loc.00790_n4"/>

In Ward A things go on the same&#8212;I dont go as often there as I did&#8212;Pyne &amp; I went on quite a spree Monday, went to the mystic Varieties &amp; elsewhere, (saw the ghost as they call it)<ptr target="loc.00790_n7"/>&#8212;had an oyster supper, ale, &amp;c. quite a time&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well I will not write any more this time&#8212;so good bye for present, Thuey, &amp; I pray God bless you, my dear loving comrade, &amp; I hope he will bring us together again&#8212;good by, dear boy, from your true friend&#8212;</p>
            <p>Thuey, I enclose an envelope but will write my address here too for future&#8212;</p>

I can send you a little, a few 10ct bills, my darling&#8212;You write to me, Thu, just how it is&#8212;you need not be afraid, my darling comrade&#8212;it is little, but it may be some use&#8212;Thuey, you write to me just as you would to your own older brother&#8212;<ptr target="loc.00790_n100"/>
