Yet after all this succoring of the stomach (which is of course most welcome &amp; indispensable) I should say that I believe my profoundest help to these sick &amp; dying men is probably the soothing invigoration I steadily bear in mind, to infuse in them through affection, cheering love, &amp; the like, between them &amp; me. It has saved more than one life. There is a strange influence here. I have formed attachments here in hospital, that I shall keep to my dying day, &amp; they will the same, without doubt.<ptr target="loc.000885_n100"/>
