            <p>I am sending you a P.O. order for &#163;10.<ptr target="n0141b"/> Some of my friends want your books and are forwarding the money through me. I also want one or two copies to give away.</p>
            
            <p>You had better, I think, send the books direct to the following:</p> 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr_kc.00018.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                <p>Both vols (Leaves of Grass &amp; Two Rivulets) to <address><addrLine>E. Seymer Thompson</addrLine>
                    <addrLine>Christ's College</addrLine>
                    <addrLine>Cambridge</addrLine></address>&#8212;ditto to 
                    <address><addrLine>Clement Templeton</addrLine>
                        <addrLine>Abernethy House</addrLine>
                        <addrLine>Mount Vernon</addrLine>
                        <addrLine>Hampstead</addrLine>
                        <addrLine>London</addrLine></address></p>

                    <addrLine>University Extension Lecturer</addrLine>

            <p>The rest you had better send to me. But do not send them immediately. I will write again when I know my address at Sheffield (where I am going shortly), and when I know which volumes are wanted.</p>
            <p>I have not seen (or heard) anything of Buchanan<ptr target="n0117"/> since I have been in England: but I shall bear in mind your message if ever I come across 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00020.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                him. I looked at Augusta Webster's<ptr target="n0840"/> poems the other day at a library: but they seemed to me commonplace&#8212;rather inclining to be intellectual&#8212;and I don't think you would care about them. They were not miscellaneous poems, but one vol: a drama and the other a Chinese story. I have made <choice><orig>enquiries</orig><reg>inquiries</reg></choice> but I can not hear of any other vol. If however by any chance you want to have one of these vols write &amp; 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="syr_kc.00021.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                tell me and I will send it.</p>

            <p>I had a letter from Arunachalaen&#8212;my Bengalese friend&#8212;whose photo: you have, not long ago. Speaking about you he says 'I have for some time been seriously thinking of writing to him to express my love &amp; reverence'. He also says 'Do send me a photograph of him. I know of no means of getting it. I want if possible also a big one that I could frame &amp; hang up'. I have sent him one of the small photographs that I 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="syr_kc.00022.jpg" type="verso"/>
               
                have.</p>
            
            <p>By the bye, I wish very much that you would not have that photograph on the fly leaf of Two Rivulets. I do not like it at all. I don't think it is like you. Could you not put, instead, the head of 1871, or that of 1872 (which I admire much)? I have been showing the photographs you gave me to my sister Dora<ptr target="n0842"/>&#8212;whose likeness you have. She is very much impressed with particularly 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="syr_kc.00023.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                the last mentioned and wants to make a painting after it in oils. She is getting on finely I think and if I can get it I shall send you a photograph of one of her last&#8212;a couple of dogs, a pug and a King Charles.</p>
            
            <p>I am finishing up my preparations for my winter course of lectures. I have got a whole lot of apparatus down here to illustrate 'sound'&#8212;organ pipes 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="syr_kc.00024.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                and tuning forks and speaking tubes and piano wires stretched on sound boards &#38;c&#8212;and am practising experiments on them much to the delight of a small nephew, who understands everything <hi rend="underline">at once</hi>&#8212;in the most alarming way&#8212;</p>
           
            <p>Remember me to Harry<ptr target="n0590"/>&#8212;I would like to know what he is doing&#8212;</p>
