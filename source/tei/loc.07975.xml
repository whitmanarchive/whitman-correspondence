            <p>I wonder how you are geting on this hot weather! I did hope that we were not going
                to have any very hot weather this summer but the past two or three days have been
                very hot.</p>
            <p>I have thought of you so much &amp; wondered how you are geting on I should have
                written to you before this had I not heard from you through pap &amp; Debbie.<ptr target="n0844c"/> &amp; Herbert<ptr target="n0262"/> comes down once in A while &amp; we hear from you
                through him. I have been in Camden once or twice &amp; should have called to see you
                but thought perhaps my <choice>

                understood that you did not see only A
                few of your friends.</p>
            <p>I went to Marlton to day saw Harry &amp; Eva<ptr target="n0590"/> they are all well.
                Harry looks well he asked after you said he had called once or twice at your place
                some time A go, but couldnot see you</p>
            <p>I suppose you know that Gomery Stafford<ptr target="n0910c"/> has sold the old place
                at Kirkwood<ptr target="loc.07975_n2"/> every thing is changed there now it's all laid out in Building lots

            <p>how much we should like to see you with us once again but suppose that can never be.
                Its A pleasure to know that you are comfortable—am glad to know that 
                Mrs D<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; the nurse<ptr target="n4319"/> are kind I hope you will
