                <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received your letter—also one from Jeffy. I wrote to Jeffy yesterday—I
                suppose it is for the best that he should go to St. Louis
<ptr target="duk.00648_n1"/>
—as it seems to be a great position—I was
                much pleased to hear that it was Mr. Kirkwood
<ptr target="duk.00648_n2"/>
                 who was the designing Engineer—&amp; also that
                    Davis
<ptr target="duk.00648_n3"/> is to
                go to St. Louis on the works—</p>

            <p>Well, mother, about domestic matters—I hardly know what to say at
                present—Jeff did not say in his letter what was proposed, or how he &amp; Mat
                thought of doing—I can tell better after I hear—But, Mother, you must
                not worry about it—it will be arranged some way—</p>

            <p>There is nothing new in my affairs—I have a little more work these days than
                usual, but get along first rate—am satisfied with the boarding-house as well
                as could be expected. Love to you &amp; all, dear mother. I write this at my
                desk—spring is quite advanced here—it is a damp, misty, cloudy
                forenoon—but pleasant—I can send you whatever money you need, dear
                mother, any time—or can come on for a few days—try to take things
                coolly.</p>
