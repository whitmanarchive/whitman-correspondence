                    Thank you&#8212;thank you! for several kind remembrences of you in periodicals and for

                    hope that you will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now &#38; 
                    then in your wilderness of books &#38; papers! With much to bring pleasure to you from

                    you have helped to illuminate &#38; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed with it 
                    physical &#38; mental heart sinkings when the unsolved, unsolvable problems of sin, pain,

                    Well, dear Comrade, we are helpless&#8212;we must go on with the deepest problems unsolved,
