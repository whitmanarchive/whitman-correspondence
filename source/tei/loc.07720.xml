                    Thank you—thank you! for several kind remembrences of you in periodicals and for
                    your letter &amp; postal,<ptr target="loc.01390_n1"/> all of which bridge over the great separating waters of the 
                    Atlantic. Our Alys<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> will have before this seen you, I trust, 
                    and given us a picture of how you fare in these days. Having got through the murderous 
                    heats of the Camden summer, I greatly

                    hope that you will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now &amp; 
                    then in your wilderness of books &amp; papers! With much to bring pleasure to you from 
                    far &amp; near—the hearty tribute of reverence and affection from those whose lives 
                    you have helped to illuminate &amp; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed with it 
                    physical &amp; mental heart sinkings when the unsolved, unsolveable problems of sin, pain, 
                    sorrow &amp; the unrevealed future

                    unrevealable consciousness, the problems are fought out—alas! with what small results 
                    of certitude. Not a few of us have met great audiences with bold words while the depths 
                    of purgatory were being stirred up within us!

                    Well, dear Comrade, we are helpless—we must go on with the deepest problems unsolved, 
                    &amp; face pain, grief, loneliness, death bravely as we can. From the condition of my heart 
                    death is a daily probability to my <choice><sic>conciousness</sic><corr>consciousness</corr></choice> 
                    &amp; I face all my responsibilities in the sense that it

                    &amp; can plan &amp; work as though I had a century before me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have many, many friends among the young &amp; earnest in whose unsoiled

                    drive around the beautiful hills, two thirds in woods &amp; undergrowth for miles. I had hoped 
                    to guide you across the ocean, but I fear that we may not now hope for that.
