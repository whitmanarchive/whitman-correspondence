            <p>It seems to be but yesterday that I saw you riding on the cars talking to the driver
                on Stevens Street, &amp; it has really been nearly three years three years, this
                coming August since I left Camden. Time has flown so rapidly that it seems but a
                year &amp; yet, again, it seems ten years, since I felt the old home <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01560_large.jpg" type="verso"/></p>
            <p>Your photograph greets me every time I go into my brother's office I have it hung
                there so we can both see it, &amp; you do not know how many people know you way out,
                in this western country.</p>
            <p>One of my friends came in the other day &amp; said, "you have still got his picture
                hung up," &amp; I said "yes! it would hang there until I go away &amp; then it will
                go <hi rend="underline">with me</hi>". it reminds me of so many pleasant chats with
                the original.</p>
            <p>New Mexico, has changed me so My Dear Mr Whitman that you would not<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01561_large.jpg" type="recto"/> recognize me. I
                am only one inch short of six feet &amp; am heavily built in proportion, weighing
                150 lbs.</p>
            <p>The first year I came out I was a cowboy, &amp; altho' it is a very prosaic life,
                still I have some very pleasant reminiscences of that time. I have been out on the
                prairie with no house or food in sight when night came &amp; had nothing to do but
                to roll up in my blankets &amp; make the best of it, then again, horse breaking is
                one of the hardest times of the cowboys life. Many a tumble I have had off<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01562_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of a broncho but
                you have to get up &amp; conquer the horse before you stop in spite of all the hard
                knocks you get.</p>
            <p>For a man with <hi rend="underline">money</hi> there <hi rend="underline">is</hi>
                wealth in the cattle business, but for a cowboy—only, a small ranche with a
                smaller number of cattle, to look forward to—after years of hard &amp;
                unceasing labor still a cowboy is always happy, contented &amp; what is the best of
                all—the finest &amp; constant friend, when you call upon him, that a man can
                have.</p>
            <p>I have been to Calafornia<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01563_large.jpg" type="recto"/> I went about the first of April &amp; was gone two weeks. the
                scenery I think was the grandest that I ever saw. It was just magnificent. I thought
                how Mr Whitman would like to see it. At times we would be going through some deep,
                dark cañon &amp; then we would burst forth into the full glory of sun as we
                hastened over a level stretch of praire, then we would slowly slowly be going up a
                steep <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="low">part</unclear> of the Rockies, only to come dashing down the<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01564_large.jpg" type="verso"/> other side with all the brakes set,
                hard &amp; objects flying by you like magic. I remember one morning we reached the
                top of the San Fransica Mts. just as the sun was rising &amp; it was grand to feel
                the sun &amp; look down the valley when all was as yet in complete darkness with the
                sun slowly ascending &amp; giving its light to the earth below. One place I remember
                well &amp; that was Cañon Diablo a great rent in the Earth 300 ft deep and 100
                ft wide<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01565_large.jpg" type="recto"/> looking
                down that fearful hole your imagination will conjure up ideas that you would not
                think of elsewhere &amp; you can realize the freaks of nature to their fullest extent But I have
                not described the town of Albuquerque &amp; I will not attempt to do so, as I can
                never describe anything correctly, but will send you a magazine that I have sent for
                which describes it fully The inhabitants are in expectations of a boom which they
                say will take place in about three months, but<pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01566_large.jpg" type="verso"/> as I am not a sanguine person I do
                not say so. I must close now as it is bedtime Mother &amp; Harry say "Remember us to
                Mr Whitman &amp; tell him that we often remember him &amp; wish we could see
                him"</p>
            <p>If you ever feel like it Mr Whitman a small letter from you would be very much
                appreciated &amp; promptly answered</p>
