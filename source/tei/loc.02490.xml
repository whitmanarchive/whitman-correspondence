            </opener>
            <p>Most heartily do I thank you for yr kindness in sending me the p.c of June 12<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02490_n2"/>
                which I received on June 25<hi rend="underline">th</hi>—the same day upon which Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> yours of the 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02490_n3"/> This looks like 
                another of the "faults
                of the p.o." of which you complain &amp; thro' which I fear several of your
                communications have gone <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02490.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> astray. </p>
            <p>Yes, I rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> your letter of June 1<hi rend="underline">st</hi><ptr target="loc.02490_n4"/> &amp; I trust that by this time you have 
                read the
                two lots of the facsimile copies which I sent to you.<ptr target="loc.02490_n5"/></p>
            <p>I note that on June 12<hi rend="underline">th</hi> you were "much the same" &amp; that on June 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi> you were
                standing the oppressively hot weather "pretty well, so far."</p>
            <p>This is welcome news for us but we hope to receive better before long.</p> 
            <p>We too, have had a spell of hot weather <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02490.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> here lately. The glorious,
                sunshiney days of the beginning of the week were followed by severe storms of
                thunder &amp; lightning with heavy rain—the lightning display being
                exceptionally brilliant &amp; prolonged—</p>
            <p>Bolton is now having a respite from the Influenza scourge &amp; I take every
                opportunity of escaping from the hot &amp; noisy town into the refreshing Country
                for an hour with nature, alone. One of these sweet hours I am now enjoying in <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02490.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> Raikes
                Wood—the nearest bit of natural wood to my house &amp; one of my favourite
                haunts—where I draft this letter, sitting upon a fallen tree trunk.</p>
            <p>As I write the birds are singing blithely upon the sycamores, oaks and ash trees all
                around me—a blackbird &amp; a thrush being especially vociferous with their
                melody; a bonnie wee bird is preening its feathers while another is <hi rend="underline">cheeping</hi> plaintively beside it; a corncrake is <hi rend="underline">crake crake</hi>-ing in the meadow across the brook <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02490.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> which, inky
                black tho' it alas! is, mirrors the blue sky &amp; its own green tree-fringed
                banks, where a lot of sparrows are jabbering noisily, a butterfly (a "straw-coloured
                psyche")<ptr target="loc.02490_n6"/> has just fluttered past me &amp; a tiny ladybird is creeping along the tree
                trunk on which I am seated.</p> 
            <p>The wood is carpeted with long slender grass—whose blades are now all diamonded
                with glistening rain drops—horsetails &amp; wild rhubarb through which I have
                had <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02490.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to wade knee
                deep to get to my sylvan throne. Here &amp; there occur blue wreaths of wild
                hyacinths intermingled with the pretty, pink flowers of the "ragged robin."</p>
            <p>There is no sun &amp; hardly any wind to move the lovely arboreal screen which hides
                me &amp; the air is fragrant with woodland scents so refreshing to a town
                dweller—</p>
            <p>Here I spent a sacredly happy hour—"happiness pervades the open
                air"<ptr target="loc.02490_n7"/>—until a sudden shower of rain <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02490.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> came pattering on the leaves,
                temporarily silencing the birds &amp; sending me home.</p>
            <p>I send you a little souvenir of that visit to my wood.</p>
            <p>I also send you two copies of my facsimile of your mask photograph, which I hope you
                will like; as well as two papers in which your name occurs.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to you for telling us about the "fuller report of the Birthday Spree"<ptr target="loc.02490_n8"/>
                that is to appear in <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02490.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

           <p>This morning I met with what might have been a serious accident. While driving in the
                phaeton one of the shafts became loose frightening the horse into running away &amp;
                upsetting the coachman &amp; me on to the pavement.</p>
            <p>Fortunately beyond a severe shaking for us both <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02490.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/> a cut arm &amp; bruised shoulder
                for him &amp; a bruised hip &amp; leg for me we did not sustain any serious injury.
                The trap was damaged but the horse escaped unhurt &amp; I am thankful things are no
                worse with us.</p>
            <p>I sincerely trust that the next news we hear of you will be favourable</p>
            <p>God bless you now and always!</p>
