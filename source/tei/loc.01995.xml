            <p>I suppose you will think by this time that I have forgotten my Dear old Friend by my long silence &amp; neglect to answer your letter, or acknowledge the receipt of your paper that you was so kind as to send me, but I assure you that I have not forgot you but sill remember you with the same Love that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#kk">commenced</unclear> in Armory Square Hospital &amp; will not cease as long as life lasts.</p>
            
            <p>There is not a day that passes but what I think of you &amp; promise myself that I will not delay writing to you any longer but as often I break my promise.</p>
            
            <p>We have had excellent Sleighing here for the past two or three weeks

and it still continues to be good &amp; all that can afford it seem to enjoy it very much.</p>
            
            <p>I am at work in the Melodeon &amp; Piano Factory of A. C. Chase again and shall probably continue there this winter. My health is very good. Father has been quite sick for a week but is improving now. Father &amp; Mother send their Love to you.</p>
            
            <p>Our Baby Walt is a fine boy now &amp; as bright as a dollar. I hope to have the pleasure of showing him to you someday.</p>
            
            <p>If you come to New York next summer &amp; cannot come up and make me a short visit let me know when you are coming and if my business will permit I will meet you at new york and have a short visit with you there.</p>
            
            <p>I hope that the exit of A Johnson &amp; the inauguration of Gen Grant
