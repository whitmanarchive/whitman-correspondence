                <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>Your most kind letter of May 23<hi rend="underline">rd</hi><ptr target="loc.04716_n1"/> 
                duly received &#38; welcomed. Thank you from my heart.</p>
            <p>It grieves me very much to note that at the time of writing there was no improvement
                in your condition&#8212;"the same continued." It is at once affecting &#38;
                inspiring that you should have written at all under such circumstances, &#38; that
                your letter should breathe such<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01208_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> unbroken cheer &#38; playful humour&#8212;as of robust &#38;
                undisturbed health&#8212;the "little spark of soul"<ptr target="loc.04716_n5"/> shining serene &#38; unobscured
                in unwavering good cheer &#38; love&#8212;"master of all terror &#38; all pain"<ptr target="loc.04716_n4"/></p>
            <p>I at once made a careful facsimile copy &#38; sent it to Johnston.<ptr target="n4102"/></p>
            <p>I need not say that we shall be delighted to receive the "audacious" photo.<ptr target="loc.02483_n5"/> you 
                promise us&#8212;which will have the additional
                interest of being the most recent portrait of you. I quite long to see it.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01209_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>It reminds me of an old intention of mine. I have several times wondered if the "<hi
                rend="underline">Portraits from Life</hi>"<ptr target="loc.02486_n5"/> advertised &#64; &#36;3
                include portraits which I have not seen. And now I will enclose money order for 13s/-
                &#38; ask you to send me a set.&#8212;Provided, that is, that you are well enough
                &#38; that it will not trouble you too much.</p> 
            <p>The weather here is dull &#38; showery&#8212;with cool east winds. But we have just
                had a gorgeous sunset&#8212;rich &#38; warm.<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01210_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I hope that the weather is better
                with you &#38; more favourable to you&#8212;Here, there is quite an excessive amount
                of sickness&#8212;influenza mainly&#8212;&#38; the Drs (our friend Johnston amongst
                them) are very heavily worked.</p>
            <p>I am very impatient of these slow mails. I long to know how you are <hi
                    rend="underline">now</hi>, &#38; I am anxiously waiting for better news.&#8212;I
                cannot emulate your serene acceptance of whatever comes. Too much of warm personal
                love is wrapped up in you for that. And yet, my loved friend &#38; master, I <hi
                    rend="underline">know</hi> in my heart of hearts that all is well, that "Love
                like the light silently wraps us all,"<ptr target="loc.04716_n3"/> &#38; that death
                itself cannot sever the love between us.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>God's blessing upon you, &#38; my tenderest love&#8212;</salute>
