               <salute>Dear Lewy,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I thought I would write you a few lines to-day&#8212;I suppose you rec'd a letter from me eight or nine days ago<ptr target="loc.00887_n1"/>&#8212;I hope this will find you in good health &amp; spirits&#8212;I wrote to you not to go about too much, &amp; eat &amp; drink too freely, &amp; I must repeat the caution&#8212;a fellow can keep himself in good condition by a little care &amp; prudence&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, Lewy, the presentation to Dr Bliss<ptr target="loc.00887_n2"/> came off last Saturday evening&#8212;it was in ward F&#8212;the beds were all cleared out, the sick put in other wards&#8212;the room cleaned, hung with greens &amp;c., looked very nice&#8212;the instruments were there on exhibition the afternoon. I took a view of them, they were in four cases, &amp; looked very fine&#8212;in the evening they were presented&#8212;speeches were made by one &amp; another&#8212;there was a band of music &amp;c&#8212;I stopt about 20 minutes, but got tired, &amp; went off among the boys that were confined to their beds&#8212;the room was crowded, &amp; every thing passed off right I heard&#8212;</p>
            <p>Lewy, we have had the hottest weather here I ever experienced&#8212;it has been now about ten days, &amp; no let up yet&#8212;Yesterday &amp; last night was the hottest, no rain for some time &amp; the air prickly &amp; burning&#8212;Still I am enjoying very good health, thank God&#8212;better this last week than I have had for two or three months&#8212;I have some thought of going on to New York for a short time, as I have not been home now in eight months, but if I do, I shall pretty surely return here before long&#8212;Lewy, the draft has been put through here in Washington the past week&#8212;they drafted lots of secessionists &amp; quite a good many darks&#8212;(I wonder if it wouldn't be a good plan to draft all of both them kinds)&#8212;I don't hear any particular war news&#8212;the Army of the Potomac is down around Warrenton&#8212;there are conscripts arriving there to fill up the reg'ts, more or less every day&#8212;it will be a great &amp; sudden change of life to many, especially such weather as this. I believe I told you in my last letter about the strange way the baby was born in the Chaplain's&#8212;well the baby is alive &amp; growing like a pig, &amp; the father Mr Lane is getting well, Mrs Lane ditto&#8212;Dr Bliss is just going off on a furlough&#8212;the Chaplain &amp; wife have left on a furlough&#8212;Taber<ptr target="loc.00887_n3"/> &amp; the rest in ward K are all right&#8212;there have been quite a good many deaths in hospital the past week or so, the heat is bad for the poor wounded men&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, Lewy, I must now wind up&#8212;I send you my love, my darling son &amp; comrade, &amp; request you to write me soon as convenient, how you are getting along &amp; all about things&#8212;I will write again before very long, till then good bye &amp; God bless you, dear son&#8212;</p>
