                <salute>My dear Sir.</salute>   
            </opener>
            <p> I have read in the newspapers the account of your dangerous illness, and hasten to
                extend to you a little information and advice.&#8212;I am but <hi rend="underline">two 
                    weeks off from my bed,</hi> after having suffered for <hi rend="underline">six</hi> weeks 
                with <hi rend="underline">Bronchial Pneumonia</hi>,&#8212;such
                as you are said to have.&#8212;I was taken down at my farm in Westchester County
                near Pleasantville station on the Harlem road. And my doctor was Doct Swift<ptr target="loc.04643_n3"/> of that
                place. He brought me through, refusing to <hi rend="underline">permit any cupping as
                    was done in Florences<ptr target="n5001"/> case</hi>; but taking <hi rend="underline">good care, that during
                    every half <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02506_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    hour,</hi> I should have a <hi rend="underline">fresh, hot flax seed poultice
                    over my lungs in front</hi>&#8212;not covering the shoulder blades, except that he
                gave me a jacket over my shirt, to protect from cold, as I thrashed about. The
                jacket was a <hi rend="underline">linen</hi> one with sleeves. so that I should not
                feel the <hi rend="underline">heat</hi> of one.&#8212;Now, after a short time, (only
                a few hours,) from my left lung, (the one worst affected,) I began to throw off a
                green mucus.&#8212;This continued for days.&#8212;My <hi rend="underline">breath</hi> 
                came &#38; went with a <hi rend="underline">rattle</hi>. but this
                he assured me would disappear, as it finally did.&#8212;My doctor insisted <hi
                    rend="underline">I would live.</hi>&#8212;others said <hi rend="underline">no. I
                    could not.</hi>&#8212;He also gave my nurse each night instructions that at the
                end of each 2 hours, I should take a milk punch of Jamaica rum, milk &#38;
                sugar,&#8212;a wine glass full.&#8212;And daytime I should take 2 or 3 as I needed
                or felt inclined.&#8212;He gave me then <hi rend="underline">sauce</hi> to eat. <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02507_large.jpg" type="recto"/> such as
                Partridges, and in fact any thing I felt I could relish. To those <hi rend="underline">flax seed</hi> 
                poultices and the stimulants which kept me up, I
                owe my <hi rend="underline">recovery.</hi> I am still a little <hi rend="underline">weak</hi>, 
                but my strength is daily improving.&#8212;I believe you can recover
                if you will follow my suggestions. And you can write to Doct Swift, or I will for
                you if you desire &#38; notify me, for the other medicines he gave me to help the
                poultices on.</p>
            <p>If I can benefit you, you can rest assured I shall <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.02508_large.jpg" type="verso"/> only be too happy to do
                so.&#8212;</p>

                <p>P.S. I used the poultices of flax seed so hot, that I could barely endure them.
                    Gradually I got so I could have one put on so hot I could not bear my hand upon
                    it. He also <hi rend="underline">painted</hi> my lungs with Iodine.&#8212;but
                    put the flax seed, red hot right over it.</p>
