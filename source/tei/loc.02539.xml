            <p>It is a cold wintry day here&#8212;a hard frost, with snow on the ground &amp;
                occasional showers of snow flakes whirling &amp; dancing in the air.</p>
            <p>I have just finished my morning's round of visits, had dinner &amp; seen the folk in
                the surgery &amp; as 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02539.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                this is mail night I thought I would sit down &amp; write a line
                or two to you, just to cheer you up a little in your sickness &amp;
                your&#8212;perhaps&#8212;loneliness. For it must be lonely for you at times in spite
                of all the dear &amp; kind friends near you, &amp; I wish you to take this letter 
                as a token of my continued &amp; unchanged affection for you &amp; of my

                heartfelt sympathy in your illness.</p>
            <p>You are much in my thoughts at all times &amp; I long with a great inexpressible
                longing to help you But if I cannot help you I can at least love you &amp; that will
                perhaps help you&#8212;who knows?</p>
            <p>From the cables' silence we conclude that you are at least holding your own against

            <p>Later</p>
            <p>I had got thus far with my letter when I was called away to take in a 
                box wh. had come by rail</p> 
            <p>Opening it I found it contained the Clay Head<ptr target="loc.02521_n5"/> of yourself from Costelloe<ptr target="loc.08177_n6"/></p>
            <p>I have hastily unpacked it &amp; placed it upon my table where it now stands at my elbow and
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02539.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                seems to look at me as I write this &amp; it dominates the whole room with 
                its Homeric massiveness &amp; rugged grandeur.</p>
            <p>It is a great prize for the College &amp; I am proud to be honoured by the custody of
                such a treasure&#8212;for of course I recognise no actual <hi rend="underline">ownership</hi>
                in it. It is <hi rend="underline">ours</hi> &amp; I am its custodian.</p>
            <p>But I must thank you for your great kindness in ordering it to be sent to us &amp;
                this I do most cordially. It is a

                noble gift &amp; we will all value it very highly indeed</p>
