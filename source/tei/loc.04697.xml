                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was extremely pleased, last evening, to receive the copy of Ingersoll's<ptr
                    target="n0839"/> lecture<ptr target="loc.04697_n2"/> you were kind enough to
                send me, &#38; I thank you for it with all my heart.</p>
            <p>I have read it over tonight for the first time.&#8212;I was hardly prepossessed in
                its favour. I had previously known but little of Ingersoll. And I learned from
                    Carlyle,<ptr target="n4301"/> long ago, to care little for <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01088.jpg" type="verso"/> platform "oratory" as such, &#38; to
                consider the main question always (as <hi rend="underline">you</hi> do) "What does
                it amount to?" And the newspaper reports (necessarily brief &#38; imperfect) did not
                make it appear to amount to very much.</p>
            <p>But the full report, as I read it, swept away all prepossession &#38; criticism,
                &#38; filled me with a great &#38; dilating joy. It is a great &#38; notable
                utterance&#8212;strong, manly brave &#38; free&#8212;worthy of its subject, &#38;
                worthy of a great American orator to an American audience.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01089.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I feel as though I should like to write to Ingersoll himself to thank him for it. And
                I rejoice, with all my heart, that at last <hi rend="underline">you</hi> should have
                heard so strong a public declaration of the value of your work. Honour to Ingersoll
                for it! and gratitude &#38; love to him from all your friends here.</p>
            <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="horbar-short-center"/>
            <p>But my rejoicing is greatly disturbed &#38; overclouded by intelligence received at
                noon today of your relapse &#38; ill health. D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J.<ptr
                    target="n4102"/> sent me a copy of a paragraph in yesterdays "<hi
                    rend="underline">Daily Graphic</hi>" as follows:&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01090.jpg" type="verso"/>"A post card received from Walt Whitman
                says:&#8212;'Am having an extra bad spell these days. May <hi rend="underline">blow
                    over; may not</hi>.'"</p>
            <p>No date is given so that I do not know when it was written. But we shall be very
                anxious indeed till we hear further. I will write to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> by
                this mail to ask him to send word at once.</p>
            <p>Dearest &#38; best of friends! Most honoured of benefactors! What <hi
                    rend="underline">can</hi> we say to you?&#8212;but that our warmest love &#38;
                sympathy &#38; our hearts' best wishes are with you always.&#8212;</p>
