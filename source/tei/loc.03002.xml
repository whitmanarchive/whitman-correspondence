                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Thank you for the papers sent the other day. I sent you one yesterday, with various
                opinions on immortality. I <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="5"/>
                Davidson says one of the strongest proofs is that we can't prove it!</p>

            <p>How comes on the preface to the stories? is it nearly done, or not begun, or how? or
                am I "too previous" in assuming that you are<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03002.002.jpg" type="verso"/> doing, or to do it? I only know what Dr.
                    Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> wrote me, as I have not heard from you on the subject
                at all. My plan is, &amp; do you like it? My plan is to put the <hi rend="underline"
                    >six</hi> published stories, &amp; the new one, "The Brazen Android" in one
                volume,&#8212;with the sketch or preface, or whatever you may think best, &amp; feel
                to do. Then you know that Appleton proposed to publish the "Carpenter" as<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03002.003.jpg" type="recto"/> an illustrated story
                for the next Christmas, &amp; Dr. Bucke says the illustration must be a picture of
                    <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. I hope that the death of O. B. <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ktl">Burce</unclear> has not changed the
                plan, he was the one who had it in hand. You know dear Walt, that they begin early
                to get up the books for Christmas, &amp; I want to have the volume out early, &amp;
                am having "The Brazen Android" put in type now, by a type<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03002.004.jpg" type="verso"/>writer, as there was but just the one
                copy in the world; &amp; I would not risk that in the mail. So, if you are in the
                mood, I shall be very glad of your part as early as you can let one have it, if I am
                to have it; which is for you to say. I have told you what a great help it will be to
                me in many ways, so shall not enlarge upon that now. I feel that <hi
                    rend="underline">you</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline">you only</hi>, are the<pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03002.005.jpg" type="recto"/> one person in all the
                world to say the right thing about William O'Connor.<ptr target="n2002"/></p>



            <p>If you have any suggestions to make about the volume I shall be very glad of them,
                for I feel that I am &amp; have been very much working in the dark. If you feel like
                it, I should like you to confer with Horace Traubel,<ptr target="n4267"/> &amp; see
                if he likes the plan of republishing in one volume.</p>
            <p>How are you<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03002.006.jpg" type="verso"/> these hot
                days? We have had it very hot, an old fashioned June.</p>
            <p>In some weeks I had two school girls with me, &amp; we went out several times in the
                evening &amp; took long horsecar rides; &amp; it brought back to mind the old days
                when you &amp; William, little Jeannie,<ptr target="n4138"/> Charles Eldridge<ptr
                    target="n0210"/> &amp; I used to go in the same way. I am alone again, but not
                    for<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03002.007.jpg" type="recto"/> long, I
                think.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed the visit from Dr. Bucke much.</p>
            <p>I wish I could see you&#8212;</p>
