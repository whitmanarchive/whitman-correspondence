            <p>Thank you for the nice chicken—had some for my
                dinner—was glad to see Van &amp; to hear from you all—</p>
            <p>I am getting over my bad spell of health—but very slowly—&amp; have been
                depressed a great deal by the sudden taking down &amp; death by hasty consumption of
                a dear friend, a young man in his 19th year—I was there all Saturday and
                Sunday—till he died ab't noon—I hadn't been out of the house for three
                weeks, before—&amp; was only able to get there with assistance—he sent
                for me to be with him—The funeral was yesterday afternoon—I did not
                intend to go to the cemetery &amp; burial, but his father wished me to so earnestly,
                I went—So all these things hang like a cloud for a while—but I shall
                without doubt soon be nearly as usual—(though I think likely a little weaker
                &amp; clumsier <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ss">permanently</unclear>).</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001r" facs="loc_gt.00028_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I have got to get out of this house too, &amp; very soon—for the new tenants
                take possession April 1. Don't know yet what move I shall make—but shall have
                to do something in a few days—If it hadn't been for my sick spell should have
                been out before this—I will let you know—(most likely shall come down
                &amp; tell you myself)<ptr target="loc.04261_n2"/>—</p>
            <p>I am sorry I missed Harry—I want to see him &amp; have him with me—was in
                hopes he would come up in the Friday, (or Saturday) morning train—&amp; still
                have some hopes—but I have just rec'd his postal card from Haddonfield that he
                would try to come up early next week—I send him my best love, &amp; always
                    welcome<ptr target="loc.04261_n3"/>—</p>
            <p>Susan I rec'd your good letter—If we only lived near, so I could come in &amp;
                spend a couple of hours every day or two I know it would do me good—Harry,
                come up soon—</p>
