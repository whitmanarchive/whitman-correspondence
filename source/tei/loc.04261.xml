            <p>Thank you for the nice chicken&#8212;had some for my
                dinner&#8212;was glad to see Van &#38; to hear from you all&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am getting over my bad spell of health&#8212;but very slowly&#8212;&#38; have been
                depressed a great deal by the sudden taking down &#38; death by hasty consumption of
                a dear friend, a young man in his 19th year&#8212;I was there all Saturday and
                Sunday&#8212;till he died ab't noon&#8212;I hadn't been out of the house for three
                weeks, before&#8212;&#38; was only able to get there with assistance&#8212;he sent
                for me to be with him&#8212;The funeral was yesterday afternoon&#8212;I did not
                intend to go to the cemetery &#38; burial, but his father wished me to so earnestly,
                I went&#8212;So all these things hang like a cloud for a while&#8212;but I shall
                without doubt soon be nearly as usual&#8212;(though I think likely a little weaker
                &#38; clumsier <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ss"

            <p>I have got to get out of this house too, &#38; very soon&#8212;for the new tenants
                take possession April 1. Don't know yet what move I shall make&#8212;but shall have
                to do something in a few days&#8212;If it hadn't been for my sick spell should have
                been out before this&#8212;I will let you know&#8212;(most likely shall come down
                &#38; tell you myself)<ptr target="loc.04261_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am sorry I missed Harry&#8212;I want to see him &#38; have him with me&#8212;was in
                hopes he would come up in the Friday, (or Saturday) morning train&#8212;&#38; still
                have some hopes&#8212;but I have just rec'd his postal card from Haddonfield that he
                would try to come up early next week&#8212;I send him my best love, &#38; always
                    welcome<ptr target="loc.04261_n3"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Susan I rec'd your good letter&#8212;If we only lived near, so I could come in &#38;
                spend a couple of hours every day or two I know it would do me good&#8212;Harry,
                come up soon&#8212;</p>
