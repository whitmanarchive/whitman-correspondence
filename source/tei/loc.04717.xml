                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your letter of May 28<hi rend="underline">th</hi> received yesterday morning.<ptr target="loc.04717_n2"/> Deep responding gratitude &amp; love
                to you for writing at all under such sad conditions—"still badly prostrated—horrible torpidity." And 
                cordial thanks to you not only for the letter, which I deeply prize, but for its address to my old &amp; dear friend
                Wentworth Dixon.<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/></p>
            <p>I took the earliest opportunity of calling on him
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01212_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with it at his office &amp; giving it to him. I read it to him first—in a sort of casual way—&amp; when I
                came to the words "Give this scrawl to Wentworth Dixon to keep if he cares for it" it was notable how his face &amp;
                neck flushed deep red with pleasure. It was a rare joy to me as well as to him.</p>
            <p>No gift could possibly have been better, &amp; I know well he will treasure it as long as he lives.</p>
            <p>Quiet, cool &amp; undemonstrative—no man in Bolton is more true &amp; genuine. A model husband &amp; father, he
                is also a friend after Horatio's<ptr target="loc.04717_n4"/> pattern—to be worn in one's heart of hearts.
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01213_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                Uncompromising in his reverence for truth alone, he quietly puts aside all that is doubtful or undemonstrable, 
                &amp; takes his stand on what is verifiable only.</p>
            <p>Leaving the orthodoxy in which he was brought up, he became an agnostic. Then, to his deep delight, 
                he found in the writings of Epictetus<ptr target="duk.00387_n1"/> &amp; Marcus Aurelius<ptr target="n0373"/> portraitures of noble souls, strong brave, 
                &amp; sincere, whom he could with a whole heart reverence &amp; love.
                He studied their books closely and with genuine enthusiasm. I have heard nothing better than two papers on 
                Epictetus he once read to our little "College"<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/>—himself a worthy representative of the noble old Roman.—
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01214_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                And now he is coming more &amp; more under <hi rend="underline">your</hi> influence. 
                He has long since learned to love &amp; honour you as a man. 
                I can see that he does this increasingly, with keener desire to understand your words, &amp; a nearer approach to 
                sympathy &amp; receptiveness. And I expect that "they will itch at his ears"<ptr target="loc.04717_n5"/> evermore, &amp; 
                that the unfolding spirit of life within him will drive him more &amp; more into fuller sympathy with a faith 
                &amp; hopes that will enrich &amp; irradiate his life.</p>
            <p>To that divine spirit I leave him with hope &amp; trust. Often in talking with him I have realized the force of
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01215_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                your words that "logic &amp; sermons never convince"<ptr target="loc.04717_n6"/> &amp; that the man's own evolution can alone supply 
                what is lacking. And a man so quietly faithful &amp; true, so resolutely good, loyal, 
                candid &amp; helpful as he cannot long fail of the best.</p>
            <p>I think you will see now why I rejoice so much that you should have addressed your letter, 
                with its brief comments on Stoicism,<ptr target="loc.04717_n7"/> to <hi rend="underline">him</hi>. I thank you, &amp; I thank God, with a full heart.</p>
            <p>He sent me a facsimile tracing of it, which I have carefully read again &amp; again, &amp; pondered over—
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01216_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Some day I hope to make it the text of a talk to the friends.</p> 
            <p>I do wish that you were better, &amp; I think of you continually with loving sympathy.</p>
            <p>The weather here has been beautiful these last 2 days though with rather cool N.E. winds. 
                A more beautiful morning than the one today never dawned out of the deep.—
            </p> 
            <closer>
                <salute>Thanks &amp; love &amp; best wishes to you always.</salute>
