            <p>
                My best thanks to you for yr kind p.c. of 
                Oct 12<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02524_n2"/> rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> two days ago, 
                from which I was pleased to gather that there was then no
                <gap reason="torn away" quantity="1" unit="word"/> for the worse with you. 
                <gap reason="torn away" quantity="1" unit="word"/>d
                too to know that you find Hodgkinson's<ptr target="loc.04829_n1"/> undershirt 
                "just right fit &#38; all"&#8212;&#38; I know that he will be pleased to hear
                that you like them.</p>
            <p>
                Along with your dear p.c. came good letters from J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> 
                H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38;

                I shall not write to J.W.W. by this mail as usual, as he will probably have 
                sailed by the time this gets to you,<ptr target="loc.02526_n4c"/> perhaps by

            <p>Last night I deliverd my Lecture on "My trip to America"<ptr target="loc.02496_n3"/> &#38; 
                shewed all my pictures by the oxyhydrogen, lime light to a large hall full of working men, their
                sweethearts &#38; their wives &#38; succeeded in holding their interest 
                for an hour &#38; a half while I talked about my American
                experiences&#8212;you &#38; your surroundings coming in for a good share of attention.</p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon I took

                Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> with me to our new Turkish Baths<ptr target="loc.02524_n6"/>&#8212;of 
                wh. I am a director&#8212;&#38; this being his first "Turkish" experience it was
                as good as pantomime to see him, &#38; better, to hear his uniquely &#38; inimitably 
                quaint &#38; humorous remarks &#38; criticisms
                all given in broad "Bowton" dialect&#8212;of the various operations &#38; processes to 
                which he was subjected at the hands of the shampooer. For example 
                the scrubbing brush was "a cat let out of a bag and clawing at him." 
                The wooden pillow had "the feathers the wrong way up":
                the tapping &#38; pounding was "playing the piano on his ribs" &#38;c &#38;c. 
                At the end he felt so invigorated
                that he wanted to know if there was anybody, about his own size &#38; weight, 
                who wanted to fight! He is a born humourist
                &#38; a downright good fellow.

                    The physicians find time to go to Milwaukee on excursions, serve as jurors,
