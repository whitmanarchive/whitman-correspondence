            <p>
                No clergiman this morning so I read the service and a sermon (One of Chas. Kingleys<ptr target="n0137"/>) myself. Since then
               have been writing official letters. It is now afternoon&#8212;perfect weather&#8212;cool, bright, white
               fleecy clouds on every hand, a gentle breeze stirring&#8212;flowers, trees, grass all in fine order after
               the good rain a few days ago. Your post card of 21<hi rend="underline">st</hi><ptr target="loc.08231_n3"/> came to hand
                yesterday&#8212;no sign yet of D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston,<ptr target="n4102"/> singular how he could have disappeared
                so completely. Willy Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> is at the asylum today&#8212;he lives in the city (London) now&#8212;works
               every day in the meter shop. He has a man working with him, they are getting ready to produce meters,
               expect to be actually manufacturing (turning out meters) in another week or two.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the asylum all is very quiet, Mr<ptr target="n0323"/> &#38; Mrs Ingram<ptr target="prc.00130_n3"/> will have given you a good idea how peaceably and quietly
               life goes on with us. I am satisfied, have really all I want except only I should like to see you oftener and have
               more time to give to the good cause&#8212;but perhaps (as far as this last is concerned) the little I do now is as much
               as I could do under any circumstances. I got the other day from England a little book by Havelock Ellis<ptr target="loc.02037_n1"/> called
                "The Criminal"[.]<ptr target="loc.08231_n1"/> I am greatly interested in it. We are all well&#8212;Little Pardee<ptr target="loc.07347_n5b"/>
               is taking private lessons (at the house) in Greek, Latin and French [/] we think after it is over he will be quiet
               strong and may go to school or college as well as any boy&#8212;he is in fact <hi rend="underline">quite well</hi>
               now, the only thing being to <hi rend="underline">keep him so</hi>
