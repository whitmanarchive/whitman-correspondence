            </opener> 
            <p>Through one &amp; another source we hear of you from time to time—sometimes by your
                postals, sometimes by the press &amp; again through mutual friends. The latest accounts
                seem to be that you are better in health in which we rejoice. But both you &amp; I have
                the one disease which has never in the ages been cured—old age! The Phoenix
                business of fable don't &amp; won't come to us! What the beyond has or has not for us we
                may not know.</p>
            <p>We have come for the summer to a wonderfully beautiful country home—perfectly
                ideal in its fascinations &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00208_large.jpg" type="verso"/>scenery. Probably one third of the country around us is in
                reserved public commons and
                woods which the mountainous country displays grandly—and all only 40 miles
                south of London. For near neighbors we have Tennyson,<ptr target="n0625"/>
                Tyndall<ptr target="n6162"/> &amp; quite a host of lesser lights in literature science &amp; art.</p>
            <p>Mary<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> has a cottage close at hand and her two little girls<ptr target="loc.01389_n4"/>
                are the poetry of our old age. Your admirer &amp; friend the truly noble Lady Mount Temple<ptr target="loc.03842_n1"/> is now our
                guest and we have been together reading your Autumn boughs<ptr target="loc.03842_n2"/> this evening. I greatly
                wish that you could be with us here to let us minister to you!</p>

            <p>Alys<ptr target="uva.00553_n3"/> returns to Philadelphia next month to finish her
                college course and she will see you soon now &amp; tell us all about you. Logan<ptr target="n6122"/> is working hard in his college course of which he is making the
                best use. We hope for the best things for him in the future through the <choice>

                    <corr>skillful</corr>
                </choice> use of his pen for which all this work is preparing him. He writes very
                bright plays for us &amp; then acts them for us with his sisters. I have full use of my
                one remaining eye and am in much better health in this much criticised but really
                best of all known climates.<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00210_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I do not see any present prospect of our return home for at our
                age it is everything to us to be near our children in whom we mostly live what
                remains to us of life.</p>
            <p>Goodbye dear friend—let us hear from you (here till October 1st &amp; then to the
                old address of 44 Grosvenor Road Westminster London) when the spirit moves you.</p>
