                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Gloriously fine here today, but <hi rend="underline">too</hi> warm. 
                I wonder how it is with you.
                I hope that the heat is not excessive or injurious to you.</p>
            <p>I write this in the afternoon—2–30—after a rest &amp; quiet read. 
                D<hi rend="underline">r</hi><ptr target="n0119"/> is away in town
                on business.</p>
            <p>After writing to you yesterday we had a most enjoyable drive to the town &amp; 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00922_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                back—the Dr's talk (chiefly about <hi rend="underline">you</hi>) 
                being extremely interesting to me.</p>
            <p>Alfred Gurd<ptr target="loc.04387_n3"/> &amp; wife<ptr target="loc.04387_n4"/> to tea in addition to previous company. 
                After tea, D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> &amp; I 
                went across to the office together. 
                Most lovely evening—the moon just rising, preternaturally large &amp; 
                impressive—Jupiter, near her, shining with a 
                lustre that rivalled the moon's. A glory still in the west, &amp; golden light 
                touching the trees here &amp; there. An indescribable
                beautiful scene, peaceful, soothing, perfect.</p>
            <p>Amongst other things 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00923_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I wrote to H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> while the Dr attended to his business. 
                Then, when he was through, 
                we had a talk I am not likely to forget, in which
                he told me of an experience he had in '71, which you doubtless know about.<ptr target="loc.04387_n5"/></p>
            <p>Home again in the moonlight. Sat for a time in the Verandah looking out on its perfect 
                beauty—figures moving about the lawn
                seeming of weird &amp; unearthly beauty, in form &amp; movement.</p>
            <p>But, lovely as the night was, I was tired &amp; went in pretty good time to bed.</p>
            <p>A lazy day today—a little writing, 2 or 3 photos, a
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00924_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                visit to the office &amp;c. I was very much touched &amp; pleased to receive 
                <hi rend="underline">another</hi> paper from you
                (The Boston Evening Transcript<ptr target="loc.08248_n5"/>) &amp; read the passage you marked with interest</p>
            <p>Another letter, too, from our indefatigable &amp; dear friend 
                H.L.T.—His letters are always like a cordial to me, &amp;
                in their zealous, ever kind, &amp; busy comradeship appeal to my deepest 
                heart—&amp; seem like a prophecy, a foretaste, of a new earth.
                God's blessings on him &amp; his!</p>
            <p>I wish I could see you just now &amp; that I could 
                <hi rend="underline">do</hi> something for you. 
                I think of you continually with loving sympathy
                &amp; blessing. May God be with you, in ever-nearing communion &amp; tenderest love &amp; blessing.<ptr target="loc.04387_n2"/>
