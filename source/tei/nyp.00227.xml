            <p>I answered your letter koughnsiquenlighly<ptr target="nyp.00227_n1"/> you owe me one, unless you think that sending a fellow some note paper would be sufficient answer. I had several thoughs then, one was that I made such a poor fish at it, that you wanted me to try over again and see if I could not do better and then I thought that you had had some <hi rend="italic">milk</hi> in your coffee which had been so strong that you imagined you had said something. there is something I am certain of and that is, a peice of blank paper is not half as interseting as one with writing on it. I would have stood on my dig some time longer if George had not brought some religious remarks to bear, something about "doing good for evil" and when a fellowed pluged you in the snoot instead of hitting back give him another try at the other side, I thought I would take note paper as it would not take so many words to fill up </p>
