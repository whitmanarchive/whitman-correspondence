            <p>The days are slipping away so pleasantly here that weeks are gone before I know it.<ptr target="n0259"/>
                The Concord folk are as friendly as they are intellectual, and there is really no
                end to the kindness received. We are rowed on the beautiful river every day that it
                is warm enough&#8212;a very winding river not much broader than your favourite
                creek&#8212;flowing sometimes through level meadows, sometimes round rocky
                promontories &amp; steep wooded hills which, with their wonderful autumn tints, are
                like a gay flower border mirrored in the water. Never in my life have I enjoyed
                outdoor pleasures more&#8212;I hardly think, so much&#8212;enhanced as they are by
                the companionship of very lovable men and women. They lead an easy-going life
                here&#8212;seem to spend half their time floating about on the river&#8212;or
                meeting in the evening to talk &amp; read aloud. Judge Hoar says it is a good place
                to live and die in, but a very bad place to make a living in. Beatrice spent one
                Sunday with us here. We walked to Hawthorne's old house in the morning, &amp; in the
                afternoon to the "Old Manse" and to Sleepy Hollow, most beautiful of last resting
                places. Tuesday we go on to Boston for a week very loth to leave Concord&#8212;at
                least, I am!&#8212;but Giddy begins to long for city life again. And then to New
                York about the 5th <choice>
                    <abbr>Nov</abbr><expan>November</expan></choice>. Herby told you, no doubt, that I spent an hour or two with
                Emerson&#8212;and that he looked very beautiful&#8212;and talked in a friendly,
                pleasant manner. A long letter from my sister in England tells me Per. looks well
                and happy &amp; is so proud of his little boy&#8212;and that Norah is really a
                perfect wife to him&#8212;affectionate, devoted, and the best of housewives. How
                glad I am Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> is painting you. I wonder if you like the landscape he is working on
                as well as you did "Timber Creek." Miss Hillard<ptr target="loc.04959_n1"/> has undertaken the charge of
                a young lady's education, and is very much pleased with her task. She is in a
                delightful family who make her quite one with them&#8212;live in the best part of
                New York, and pay her a handsome salary. She has the afternoons and Saturday &amp;
                Sunday to herself.&#8212;Concord boasts of having been first to recognize your
                genius. Mr. Alcott &amp; Mr. Sanborn say so. Good-bye, dear Friend.</p>
