            <p>Did you see my snow study "Tumultuous Privacy,["] last monday in Transcript for

            <p>Every emendation of yrs is good. I rather doubted at first yr sub&#61;head. But I
                guess it's better than mine, (wh' was too big&#61;headed for the main structure).
                Your other touches give accuracy to my over&#61;statements. Really I was unfit to
                treat the subject[.] Howsoever, we've <hi rend="underline">together</hi> hammered
                out a bit of wrought&#61;iron work of some value. I never said anything just like it
                for fact&#61;iness. The thing grew upon both of us, as we went on. Somebody ought to
                write a scholarly&#61;picturesque thorough &#38; exhaustive history of the
                Dutch&#61;Americans. I wish I were rich enough. I wd&#8212; go to Albany &#38; the
                pastoral horse&#61;raising regions of New York State, &#38; to N.Y. City &#38; L.
                Island, &#38; study the <hi rend="underline">Dutch</hi> people at first hand. I
                remember years ago I had a splendid <hi rend="underline">clean</hi> young Dutch
                commerical fellow as a pupil in Brooklyn, N.Y. I taught him English through the
                medium chiefly of German.</p>

                <p>I'm afraid with that rebellious bowel business your experience must be something
                    like that of an old Scotchman I heard of who was opposed to having water closets
                    in the middle of a house.</p>

                <p>"Mr Whatcomb [Whitcomb]" said he, "I dont like 'em. A man can't make <hi
                        rend="underline">a bet of wand</hi> without being heard all over the
                    house"!</p>
