               </opener>
               <p>Mother received your letter<ptr target="loc.00433_n2"/> to-night&#8212;we were all very glad to hear that you arrived so nicely and were so well established&#8212;The enclosed two letters came to-day<ptr target="loc.00433_n3"/>&#8212;I sent the box to dear brother George yesterday at noon directed just as you left word&#8212;I got some hoop iron and straped the box up strong&#8212;I dont suppose there can be anything wrong in sending it straped in that way&#8212;do you suppose there is? I had in it a ham piece of smoked beef can of milk (condensed) coffee can of peaches&#8212;crackers&#8212;potatoes&#8212;salt&#8212;and the clothes that he sent for&#8212;I think I will send him another next week or week after&#8212;We were all elated upon seeing the letters published yesterday about the exchange of prisoners.<ptr target="loc.00433_n4"/> O I so hope they will make an exchange&#8212;can you not write something that will keep up the talk about the matter, sometimes little weights when the[y] fall at the right moment turn the scale and accomplish great results  Seems as if twould be worth almost a life time to help along such a thing as the general exchange of prisoners&#8212;</p>
               <p>so you have assumed the duties and honors of an officer of the government<ptr target="loc.00433_n5"/>  Mother was wondering at tea to-night what you would have to do&#8212;I told her that undoubtedly the first thing would be to calculate just exactly how many little indians John Brown<ptr target="loc.00433_n6"/> did have&#8212;as that was the first thing the clerks had to do in the Indian dept.&#8212;What the devil is the Indian dept.&#8212;? It is suggestive of scalps, war and paint&#8212;whiskey and laziness  However I suppose you have not yet had time to tell what the business is about but anyhow if it is only a comfortable berth without too much hard work, it will come in good<ptr target="loc.00433_n7"/>&#8212;I hope you will have good health&#8212;I would suggest that you should not go it too strong in the Hospital way, for a while&#8212;I would draw it mild for a month or so&#8212;How does it seem to you to go back&#8212;I suppose it looks quite natural&#8212;I hope to be able to come and make you a visit soon&#8212;probabaly some time next mont[h]&#8212;Write to me Walt&#8212;I like to hear from you often&#8212;Write to George tell him we sent his box and will send more</p>
