            </opener>
         <p>Yours came to me on Friday last much sooner than I<ptr target="duk.00376_n100"/> expected </p>
            <p>Because my being so negligent of course I supposed you would act
the same to me</p>
            <p>Last week I was sick so that the house was obliged to hold me very tight  It is kind of a curious thing for me. I can not go out in to the open air with out taking cold</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will call at Armory Square when in Washington. I have been thinking about going there this winter to wile a way some of these lonesome days</p>
            <p>My Folks have some objections to my going where I have been so often for the last three years. But there is nothing like geting used to a thing or too</p>
            <p>The least stormy weather here drives us in to the house&#8212;But the rainyest night on Picket in Virginia we had to stand any how. Even a snow storme or too we have had here then I thought about being by the side of a snug fire all curdleed up in a little heap half froze to death</p>
            <p>A good warme bed a fellow gets at home besides other fixens throwed in. I hardly evr thought of these when I Enlisted &amp; perhaps I may try the self same opperations again. This is a curious world to live &amp; sport in   There will be no Young ladies after this war closes.</p>
            <p>Because they are a fraid some of the loved ones will come home crippled &amp; they will Marry while they think about it  Mostly of the Softer Sex will be old Maids waiting so long. I presume some of them are tired</p>
            <p>Yes I will tell her all about you one of these times &amp; that before she is Married which wont be a great while. Well Uncle I hope this may find you still alive &amp; well</p>
            <closer rend="right">
               <salute>My best respects To you, My Uncle</salute>
               <salute>Adieu till next time</salute>
