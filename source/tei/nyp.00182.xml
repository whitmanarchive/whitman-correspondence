               <salute>Dear brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I sit down to rattle off in haste a few lines to you. I do not know what is the reason I have been favored with nary a word from you, to let me know whether you are alive &amp; well&#8212;that is, if you are so, which I pray to God you are. My thoughts are with you often enough, &amp; I make reckoning when we shall one day be together again&#8212;yet how useless it is to make calculations for the future. Still a fellow will.</p>
            <p>Tom, I wrote you one letter April 21st, &amp; then another April 26th. The first one must have gone all right, as a letter was received by me April 28th,<ptr target="nyp.00182_n1"/> (very pretty written)&#8212;but I have not heard whether you got my second letter. I enclosed in it an envelope with my address on, in hopes you would write to me.</p>
            <p>Well, dear brother, the great battle between Hooker &amp; Lee came off, &amp; what a battle it was&#8212;without any decisive results again, though at the cost of so many brave men's lives &amp; limbs&#8212;it seems too dreadful, that such bloody contests, without settling any thing, should go on. The hospitals here are filled with the wounded, I think the worst cases &amp; the plentiest of any fighting yet. Was you in the fight? I have made inquiries of two of the 11th Mass. here in hospital, but they could not tell me about you for certain.</p>
            <p>Lewy Brown<ptr target="nyp.00182_n2"/> seems to be getting along pretty well. I hope he will be up &amp; around before long&#8212;he is a good boy, &amp; has my love, &amp; when he is discharged, I should feel it a comfort to share with Lewy whatever I might have&#8212;&amp; indeed if I ever have the means, he shall never want.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bliss<ptr target="nyp.00182_n3"/> was removed from Armory &amp; put for a few days in the Old Capitol prison&#8212;there is now some talk however of his going back to Armory. There is no particular change in my affairs here&#8212;I just about manage to pay my way, with newspaper correspondence &amp;c. Tom, I believe I shall have to lay pipe for some office, clerkship, or something&#8212;</p>
            <p>We had awful hot weather here three or four days ago&#8212;O how the grease run off of me&#8212;I invested in an umbrella &amp; fan&#8212;it must have been gay<ptr target="nyp.00182_n4"/> down there about Falmouth&#8212;didn't you want some <hi rend="italic">ice cream</hi> about last Sunday?</p>
            <p>My dearest comrade, I cannot, though I attempt it, put in a letter the feelings of my heart&#8212;I suppose my letters sound strange &amp; unusual to you as it is, but as I am only expressing the truth in them, I do not trouble myself on that account. As I intimated before, I do not expect you to return for me the same degree of love I have for you.</p>
