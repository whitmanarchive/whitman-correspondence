            <p>I am writing to you from Mary's<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> to tell you about her and
                her dear little baby, four weeks old. It is another little girl to be called
                Katherine Elizabeth,<ptr target="n6186"/> but Karin (pronounced like the "a" in
                'car') for short. She is a dear good little baby with large blue eyes, and Ray<ptr
                    target="n3137"/> is so pleased with<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00048_large.jpg" type="verso"/> her little sister. She calls her
                "isser" &#38; likes to kiss &#38; stroke her. Mary is not as well as she ought to
                be, a toublesome wisdom tooth having followed the appearance of the baby, and that
                is why she hasnot written to you, though she has thought of you very often. The rest
                of us are all well &#38; very pleased to be back in England again. Father<ptr
                    target="n4979"/> &#38; Mother &#38; I spent the winter

                &#38; Italy &#38; we enjoyed the trip very much indeed, but still nothing compares
                to London &#38; to the dear old Thames running by us here.</p> 

            <p>Mr. Rhys<ptr target="n4152"/> &#38; his sister<ptr target="loc.03813_n3"/> are near
                neighbours of ours in Westminster &#38; I have seen the sister once since I came
                home. I think she is very pretty &#38; charming, as you said.</p> 

            <p>Have you seen that novel "The Story of an African Farm"? We saw a good deal of the<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00050_large.jpg" type="verso"/> author, Olive
                    Schreiner,<ptr target="n7503"/> when we were in the Riviera, &#38; she is such
                an interesting girl. She has wonderful dark eyes &#38; a lovely expressive face,
                &#38; her conversation is most delightful. I wish that she were going to America
                instead of back to Africa, so that you could see her.&#8212; Mary sends you a great
                deal of love &#38; so do I, dear Mr. Whitman. We hope you are pretty well. Will you
                give my love to Mrs. Davis?<ptr target="n6113"/></p>
