            <p>Yours of 17<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.07909_n3"/> came, I believe,
                    19<hi rend="underline">th</hi> in ev'g. Next day I was away from early m'n'g to
                late night at Toronto and Hamilton seeing the inspector and the Provincial Secretary
                re case Ross v. Bucke.<ptr target="loc.07882_n8"/> They do not consider me in any
                way to blame and the government will assume the case paying all costs and
                damage&#8212;but meantime we shall appeal to a higher court and try to get the
                verdict set aside. There is no manner of doubt that the verdict was a most
                outrageous breach of justice, and even (I believe) of law. Nothing was done or said
                by me that ought not to have been done and said. If I did not repeat every word in a
                similar case happening say tomorrow it would not be because I <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_zs.00240.jpg" type="verso"/> ought not but because I would be afraid
                to do what was right for fear of getting into trouble.</p>
            <p>Thanks for enclosing Stoddart's<ptr target="loc.04674_n1"/> letter<ptr
                    target="loc.07909_n2"/> and especially for the little piece called "The Pallid
                    Wreath"<ptr target="loc.02219_n2"/> which I find one of the most touching little
                poems I ever read.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear that at time of writing you were not suffering so much but it is
                plain that you are not, on the whole, having a good time. I wish&#8212;and
                wish&#8212;but can do little enough. I can find no fault with your diet and I agree
                with you that you ought to eat a fair quantity&#8212;do not believe that anything
                like abstinence would be good for you&#8212;only make you uncomfortable for nothing.
                My greatest comfort is that from Horace's<ptr target="n4267"/> accounts you <hi
                    rend="underline">seem</hi> and <hi rend="underline">look</hi> well and that
                being the case however you may suffer your condition cannot be out &#38; out serious </p>
