                <salute>Dear Walt:<!--<ptr target="n2002"/>--></salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I enclose the letters from Riley<!--<ptr target="n3005"/>--> and Bathgate<!--<ptr target="n3019"
                />--> you sent me long ago, and which should have been returned earlier, and would have
                been but for the maelstrom confusion in which I have lived the sad year past. All
                the letters you told me to forward to Bucke<!--<ptr target="n0119"/>--> went on to him
                except one, which was overlooked, and has been sent lately.</p>

            <p>I was very much touched with what Ruskin<!--<ptr target="n3005"/>--> wrote, which seemed to
                me to be very strongly on your side. You appear to <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03295.002.jpg" type="verso"/> have a different impression, judging by
                some remarks you make in a letter of last October, and perhaps have some other
                information. It seems a great thing to say, as Ruskin does, that your book "is
                deadly true&#8212;in the sense of rifles&#8212;against our deadliest social
                sins"&#8212;and also that its fruit is "ungatherable save by loving and gleaning
                hands, <hi rend="underline">and by the blessed ones of the poor</hi>." I understand
                this as a high endorsement, coupled with a bitter indictment of English society. But
                maybe mine is a misreading.</p>

            <p>I never told you about <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03295.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                Macaulay's article on you<!--<ptr target="loc.01270_n2"/>--> in the "Nineteenth Century."
                It is certainly very fine, and I greatly enjoyed it. His reservations were
                completely oversloughed by his eulogy.</p>

            <p>Do you hear any more of Rolleston's<!--<ptr target="n1027"/>--> German translation?</p>

            <p>The <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi> this week (I have just seen it) does not print
                my reply, which may have come too late, and perhaps will appear next week.</p>

            <p>Your postal card of the 14th came.<!--<ptr target="loc.03295_n1"/>--> What a good time you
                must have. Well I know that delightful <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03295.004.jpg" type="verso"/> Germantown landscape, and the unmatched
                Wissahikon.</p>
            <p>The enclosed about the Nirvana is good. I never believed that the Buddhist meant
                annihilation.</p>

            <p>I sent Tucker<!--<ptr target="nyp.00496_n4"/>--> one of Bucke's books, in souvenir of the
                gallant stand he made for you against the authorities. Did you send Mrs. Ritter<!--<ptr
                    target="upa.00070_n4"/>--> one? I want to avoid sending to anyone who may have
                received the book already. You have probably sent one to Mrs. Gilchrist.<!--<ptr
                    target="n0259"/>--></p>
