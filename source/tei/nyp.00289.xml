            <p>I am still troubled with a severe cold in my head—I suppose it is that which causes me

            <p>We have had a cold snap here—but this forenoon it is very pleasant, bright, &amp; comfortable enough—I did not have any bad spells in the head yesterday—nor, so far, to-day—My cold in the head has been extremely bad, &amp; is not well yet—Went up to Ashton's<ptr target="nyp.00289_n6"/> Thursday evening to spend the evening with some company—had supper about 9 o'clock.

            <p>Well, mother, I will finish my letter &amp; send it off—I thought to send it yesterday, Sunday, but did not come down to the office. All goes on the same with me—it is now about 11 oclock, and very pleasant—I am rather busy to-day with work in the office—but nothing to hurt—I have had a present of the most beautiful red rose you ever see—I have put it in a little glass of water, on my desk—Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; George &amp; all.<ptr target="nyp.00289_n7"/></p>
