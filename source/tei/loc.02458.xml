            <p>
               I was greatly pleased at receiving your kind postcard of Dec. 31st. this morning &amp; I thank you
               most cordially for it &amp; for the thoughtful consideration which prompted you to write it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was extremely sorry to learn from it, though, that there was then so little real improvement in 
                yr. physical condition&#8212;"health points much the same, (not favourable)," 
                so says the p.c.&#8212;but I am glad to know that you were in "fair spirits" &amp; able to sit up &amp; 
                "write a little."         
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02458.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>
                My best thanks to you, too, for your kind offer to "send, or notify" me of, any thing you may write
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could do something to <hi rend="underline">really</hi> help you, &amp; 
                it grieves me to think how powerless I am; for I can do nothing but write to you &amp; try to <choice><orig>shew
                </orig><reg>show</reg></choice> you something 
                of a personal affection for you which is almost filial in its intensity &amp; of the gratitude with which my heart 
                is filled to overflowing, for all your great &amp; countless benefactions to me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                God bless &amp; keep you now &amp; always, my life's Blessing, my Soul's Guide, Philosopher, Friend &amp; Comrade Perfect!

                By last mail I received a kind letter from Mrs O'Connor<ptr target="n4137"/> acknowledging the receipt of the copy 
                of my "notes" sent at your request. In it she informs me that her late husband's story, "The Brazen Android," is to appear in 
                the <hi rend="underline">Atlantic Monthly</hi> for April &amp; May &amp; the volume containing all the seven stories later. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also had a friendly &amp; affectionate letter from John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> in wh. he says that he is pleased with the pamphlet, 
                &amp; compliments me upon my sketch of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I send you a Bolton paper containing an account of a serious railway collision to which I was called professionally. It was a 
                distressing scene but fortunately
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02458.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                it has not been attended with any fatal results. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Today there are signs that our long frost is breaking up as a thaw, which seems <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#kw" cert="low">general</unclear>, 
                has fairly set in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I enclose a par., cut from the <hi rend="underline">Family Herald</hi> (London), in which your name occurs. It <choice><orig>shews
                </orig><reg>shows</reg></choice> that you have a 
                reader on the staff of that paper. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope, when this reaches you, that you will be freed from the ailments which have troubled you for so long or at least that you
                may be relieved from the pain &amp; able to enjoy your life in comparative comfort. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With kindest regards to all the members of yr household &amp; with best love to yourself
