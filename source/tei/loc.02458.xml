                <salute>My dear old friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was greatly pleased at receiving your kind post card of Dec<hi rend="underline"
                    >r</hi> 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi><ptr target="n5002c"/> this morning &#38;
                I thank you most cordially for it &#38; for the thoughtful consideration which
                prompted you to write it.</p>
            <p>I was extremely sorry to learn from it, though, that there was then so little real
                improvement in y<hi rend="underline">r</hi> physical condition&#8212;"health points
                much the same, (not favourable)," so says the p.c.&#8212;but I am glad to know that
                you were in "fair spirits" &#38; able to sit up &#38; "write a little."</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02458.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>My best thanks to you, too, for your kind offer to "send, or notify" me of, any thing
                you may write</p>
            <p>I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could do something to <hi rend="underline"
                    >really</hi> help you; &#38; it grieves me to think how powerless I am; for I
                can do nothing but write to you &#38; try to <choice>

                    <reg>show</reg>
                </choice> you something of a personal affection for you which is almost filial in
                its intensity &#38; of the gratitude with which my heart is filled to overflowing,
                for all your great &#38; countless benefactions to me.</p>
            <p>God bless &#38; keep you now &#38; always, my life's Blessing, my Soul's Guide,
                Philosopher, Friend &#38; Comrade Perfect!</p>

            <p>By last mail I received a kind letter from Mr<hi rend="underline">s</hi> O'Connor<ptr
                    target="n4137"/> acknowledging the receipt of the copy of my "Notes"<ptr
                    target="loc.02495_n4"/> sent at your request. In it she informs me that her late
                husband's story, "The Brazen Android," is to appear in
                the <hi rend="underline">Atlantic Monthly</hi> for April &#38; May &#38; the volume
                containing all the seven stories later.<ptr target="loc.02472_n9"/></p>
            <p>I have also had a friendly &#38; affectionate letter from John Burroughs<ptr
                    target="n0129"/> in wh: he says that he is pleased with the pamphlet, &#38;
                compliments me upon my sketch of you.</p>
            <p>I send you a Bolton paper containing an account of a serious railway collision to
                which I was called professionally. It was a distressing scene but fortunately <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02458.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> it has not been
                attended with any fatal results&#8212;</p>
            <p>Today there are signs that our long frost is breaking up as a thaw, which seems
                 general, has fairly
                set in&#8212;</p>
            <p>I enclose a par., cut from the <hi rend="underline">Family Herald</hi><ptr
                target="loc.02448_n14"/> (London), in which your name occurs.<ptr target="n5002f"/> It <choice>

                    <reg>shows</reg>
                </choice> that you have a reader on the staff of that paper.</p>
            <p>I hope, when this reaches you, that you will be freed from the ailments which have
                troubled you for so long or at least that you may be relieved from the pain &#38;
                able to enjoy your life in comparative comfort.</p>
            <p>With kindest regards to all the members of y<hi rend="underline">r</hi> household
                &#38; with best love to yourself</p>
