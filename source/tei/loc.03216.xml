                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It seems fitting that, as I have been writing about you, I should submit for your
                inspection what I have written, and therefore I send to you by this mail a copy of
                Murray's Magazine for the present month.<ptr target="loc.03216_n2"/> Whether or not
                you will approve of what I say, I cannot tell; but of this I am sure that it is
                sincerely spoken and not in haste. I hardly know <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03216.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03216.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> how many years
                it is since I began to prepare it. Some four or five years ago I read a portion of
                it to a society of "Literary &amp; Scientific" persons (as they styled themselves)
                in Birkenhead, and succeeded in stimulating them to enquire for themselves about the
                brave poet of whom they had often heard but knew little. Again, last December, a
                more important society in Liverpool listened to what I had to say on the same
                subject. Part of what I told them is contained in the present article &amp; part in
                a pamphlet which I will send you later on, as soon <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03216.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03216.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> as I receive it.
                I may say that at this meeting I had the pleasure of hearing several warm admirers
                of yourself discuss my paper. Mr. E. R. Russell,<ptr target="loc.03216_n3"/> the
                editor of the Liverpool <hi rend="underline">Post</hi> and late M. P for Glasgow had
                some good &amp; wise words to say. Perhaps in its printed form my article may
                stimulate others to enquire. If so I shall be well satisfied.</p>
