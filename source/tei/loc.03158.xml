                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> This is a fine Xmas morning&#8212;cold &#38; clear&#8212;the air full of church
                bells chiming. </p>

            <p> You should see my old mother&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg"
                    cert="low">spry</unclear> today, gets about without a stick, not bowed, nor over
                much wrinkled; full of fun and clear headed &#38; able to direct the turkey-stuffing
                and suet-pudding making as well as ever. She has kept her mentality (as the
                spiritists used to say) as sound &amp; bright as ever it was. And her memory is
                remarkable. She calls up the forgotten past and tells us all of our deeds &#38;
                misdeeds. You bet she was awfully tickled to see me&#8212;I found them all <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03158.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> abed, &#38; had
                to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="medium">ring</unclear> them up. They
                all came down, my brothers, sister, &#38; the three children, &#38; didn't get back
                to bed again till past one o clock. They also have a capacious tea pot, &#38; it was
                well filled. I gave mother your compliments &#38; she sends her kindest to you,
                &#38; hopes you will take a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="medium"
                    >start</unclear> someday as she did &#38; walk without cane. She was delighted
                with the cake the Harned's sent, &#38; with Mrs Davis'<ptr target="n6113"/>
                silk kerchief. She said the "angel food was sadly needed" in her family. And then
                you should hear her laugh. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03158.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> She said she used to say when she was a girl, she hoped she
                should never get so polite she couldn't laugh, &#38; she believes laughing has kept
                her alive. </p>
            <p> I find my brother a very democratic individual&#8212;rather opinionated &#38; too
                "damn sure" to get on easy with; but he allows two black fellows to sleep in his
                shop &#38; ekes out their scanty subsistence with a cup of coffee &#38; a "bite,"
                &#38; at Christmas dinner he had up an old lady who lives alone, a sort of
                counterpart to Aunt Mary. She thought she must do something, so she brought up a
                "poor man's pudding" <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03158.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> and we had the toughest job to get away with it, so as not to
                disturb her. </p>
            <p> I am in the midst of the confusion&#8212;all the family around &#38; talking, &#38;
                the cold weather&#8212;I wonder if it's so in Camden. </p>
            <p> I just write this <hi rend="underline">memoranda</hi> to let you know the situation.
                Perhaps Mrs Davis will care to read it, &#38; accept the old lady's proud thanks.
                The first my brother said when I showed him the Hicks picture<ptr
                    target="loc.03158_n2"/> was&#8212;"He's the man who said the blood of Christ has
                no more to do with our sins" &amp;c. He thinks it a grand head. </p>
            <p> Send me a few words if no more. Hope the day has been a merry one for you all. </p>
