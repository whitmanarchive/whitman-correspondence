                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> This is a fine Xmas morning—cold &amp; clear—the air full of church
                bells chiming. </p>

            <p> You should see my old mother—<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">spry</unclear> today, gets about without a stick, not bowed, nor over
                much wrinkled; full of fun and clear headed &amp; able to direct the turkey-stuffing
                and suet-pudding making as well as ever. She has kept her mentality (as the
                spiritists used to say) as sound &amp; bright as ever it was. And her memory is
                remarkable. She calls up the forgotten past and tells us all of our deeds &amp;
                misdeeds. You bet she was awfully tickled to see me—I found them all <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03158.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> abed, &amp; had
                to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="medium">ring</unclear> them up. They
                all came down, my brothers, sister, &amp; the three children, &amp; didn't get back
                to bed again till past one o clock. They also have a capacious tea pot, &amp; it was
                well filled. I gave mother your compliments &amp; she sends her kindest to you,
                &amp; hopes you will take a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="medium">start</unclear> someday as she did &amp; walk without cane. She was delighted
                with the cake the Harned's sent, &amp; with Mrs Davis'<ptr target="n6113"/>
                silk kerchief. She said the "angel food was sadly needed" in her family. And then
                you should hear her laugh. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03158.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> She said she used to say when she was a girl, she hoped she
                should never get so polite she couldn't laugh, &amp; she believes laughing has kept
                her alive. </p>
            <p> I find my brother a very democratic individual—rather opinionated &amp; too
                "damn sure" to get on easy with; but he allows two black fellows to sleep in his
                shop &amp; ekes out their scanty subsistence with a cup of coffee &amp; a "bite,"
                &amp; at Christmas dinner he had up an old lady who lives alone, a sort of
                counterpart to Aunt Mary. She thought she must do something, so she brought up a
                "poor man's pudding" <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03158.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> and we had the toughest job to get away with it, so as not to
                disturb her. </p>
            <p> I am in the midst of the confusion—all the family around &amp; talking, &amp;
                the cold weather—I wonder if it's so in Camden. </p>
            <p> I just write this <hi rend="underline">memoranda</hi> to let you know the situation.
                Perhaps Mrs Davis will care to read it, &amp; accept the old lady's proud thanks.
                The first my brother said when I showed him the Hicks picture<ptr target="loc.03158_n2"/> was—"He's the man who said the blood of Christ has
                no more to do with our sins" &amp;c. He thinks it a grand head. </p>
            <p> Send me a few words if no more. Hope the day has been a merry one for you all. </p>
