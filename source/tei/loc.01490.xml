                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I ought before now to have thanked you for the poem "After all, not to create only",
                which I read with very great interest &amp; pleasure. The evening I came to Dublin a
                friend—Todhunter—offered to lend me a copy cut out of a New York
                newspaper, not knowing I had seen it. Much work lying before me on my return here
                prevented me from thanking you sooner.</p>
            
            <p> Probably the Hon. Roden Noel, almost certainly Mr Rossetti has sent you a copy of
                this month's "Dark Blue"—nevertheless on the chance of your not having seen it
                I post a copy. I think you can hardly fail to be pleased with the article upon your poems. The essay in the same number
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01490.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                upon Robert Browning is by Miss West, whom I named to you as one who knew &amp; loved what you have
                written.</p>

            <p>I also send you the first morsel of O'Grady's writing (I named him to you also),
                which has got into print—"Apollo". You will see, I think, that he springs from
                Carlyle on one side, &amp; from you on the other, &amp; is an aristocratic-democrat
                or democratic aristocrat. I do not wholly like "Apollo". I think he has made Apollo
                (&amp; his English fellow) too idle, a god of glorious play merely, whereas he
                really does each day a good day's joyous work, illuminating the world, &amp; slaying
                Python, &amp; doctoring sick folk in a magnificent

                manner.</p>

            <p>We have heard here that Mr. Tennyson has asked you to come to him. I hope you will
                come. And if to England—to Ireland too. And if to Ireland, would you not come
                to this house if you had not pleasanter quarters? Your welcome, at least, would be
                very sincere.</p>
