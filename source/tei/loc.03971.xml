                <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received your welcome letter on the 31,<ptr target="n0590"/> was glad to get it, I received one from H Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> the same day, he wishes me to come up to his house and go out to the theatre with him on Saturday, but I will not get to go, if I could go anywhere I would come up to see you, but I will have to put it off until next Saturday week, I think, I want to come up and see you so bad but cannot. I did not get my load of cabbage

            sold, had to leave them with a commissioner, over in the city, I got all wet and <choice><sic>cought</sic><corr>caught</corr></choice> cold, and have not been well since, have had the head ache all the time. It is raining very hard there, and when I went out to get the paper to write to you I got all wet and got the paper wet also, you must excuse the paper. I wrote a letter Jo, to-day. I have not heard from him for a long time, I think that I wrote the last letter to him, but perhaps he did not get it, for I put it in a Telegraphic envelope

            and perhaps he has not received it. I am still with B K Sharp,<ptr target="n1041"/> him and I had a row one day last week, he came in as he always does <unclear reason="damage" cert="high" resp="#vm">with</unclear> some of his fooling and I gave him back as good as he sent and he got on his ear about it and <choice><sic>toled</sic><corr>told</corr></choice> me if things did not suit me here I was free to leave at any time, then I cursed him and went out of the office and went over to the Narrow Gauge and found a job, but when I came back to tell him he made up with me, and I
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00122.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            the same with him, so I did not go.</p>
            <p>The <choice><sic>folkes</sic><corr>folks</corr></choice> are all well I <choice><sic>ballieve</sic><corr>believe</corr></choice>, and I feel better than I have for the past 3 days, but not as well as I did before I went to market. I hear that: Elmer<ptr target="n0858"/> was over to see you 2 times and you and him went over to Mrs. Gilchrist's<ptr target="n0259"/> to spend the evening, hope you had a good time. I must close.</p>
