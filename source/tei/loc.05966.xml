                The conviction that I am
                the least and latest of all
                poets gives me courage to
                write to you who are so far
                beyond me in years, honors,
                knowledge and&#8212;most pathetic
                of all in one sense&#8212;the world's
                laurelled acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                "When lilacs last in dooryards bloomed"
                I was reading from papers of yours
                in Colonel Romey's <hi rend="underline">Progress</hi>. I
                then wrote to him a little prose
                sonnet trying to tell how much
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jp.00180_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                pleasure I crowded into
                those brief readings. There
                was a short poem of yours
                "Italian Music in Dakota"
                which has always been to
                me like a saunter through
                spicy, summer-warm woods,
                when the brooks were low-voiced 
                under the alders, and
                the air was heavy with not
                yet escaped storm bursts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the window where I
                do my morning work, there is
                an old lilac tree, dating from
                my grandmother's youth&#8212;and
                when in spring it is strong but
                proud, bearing great clusters of
                purple bloom, and I think always
                of you and your lines,
                heavy with <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">tears</unclear>, while you
                throw your lilac boughs on
                the martyr President's coffin.
                <hi rend="underline">That</hi> is noble! The voice
                you speak with there!
            </p>
            <p>
                If I had written anything
                to compare, even so slightly with
                this noble and rugged harmony
                of your verse, I would send 
                it to you with this, asking
                you to read it and recognize it
                as from one of the youngest, the
                least aspiring of the children
                who follow and look up to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Won't you send me a line
                with your name? There!
                I have dared to ask much.
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_jp.00181_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                Forgive my assurance, and,
                if possible give me that
                pleasure of that great recompense
                for being so unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been reading Mr
                Stedman's article in the Nov.
                Scribner&#8212;it must be pleasant
                to have such friends, and
                such appreciation. I have
                read too your views in the
                North American Review on
                The Poetry of the Future.
