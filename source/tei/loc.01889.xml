                are willing to confess in it, however, to being an irregular correspondent, I gladly
                avail myself of so tempting an opening for saying that I am the same&#8212;&#38;
                shall feel confident that my delay is pardoned.</p>
            <p>I read with much zeal the poem<ptr target="upa.00013_n2"/> you kindly sent me, with
                its deep sonata–like alternations of emotion.</p>
            <p>It was a peculiar pleasure to me to get acquainted with Mr. Bur<pb xml:id="leaf001v"

                </choice> you please remember me with great cordiality whenever the chance occurs.
                He may have told you&#8212;&#38; indeed it cannot have needed telling&#8212;that you
                were a very principal subject of our discourse, &#38; of my reiterated
                enquiries.</p>
            <p>It interests me to see in your letter that you have a habit of taking moonlight walks
                out of Washington: I used to find walks of this kind highly enjoyable, &#38; have
                frequently indulged in them years ago. In my youth I was living in habits of daily
                &#38; brotherly intimacy with various painters (Millais,<ptr target="n0771"/> Holman
                      Hunt,<ptr target="n0317"/> &#38;c); &#38; from time to time we <choice>

                  night<!-- First recorded instance of "night boating." -->, &#38; pass the whole
                  night, &#38; sometimes the succeeding day 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01889.027_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                as well, tramping about, &#38;
                enjoying the varying effects of night, dawn, &#38;c&#8212;studied of course with
                peculiar interest, &#38; directness of observation &#38; purpose, by the painters:
                sometimes, instead of walking, we <choice>

                agreeable country round London: but, unless one lives quite out in the suburbs, it
                takes miles of walking to get even to the beginning of anything green or rural. I
                can easily imagine that to walk out of Washington at night "into Virginia or
                Maryland"<ptr target= "loc.01889_n3"/> is an experience of a very different sort, in point of grandeur &#38;

                are asleep, &#38; scarcely a passenger met athwart one's path. The interval when the
                streets are really deserted to this extent is but brief: I suppose from about 2&#190; to
                4 a.m. is the most vacant time.</p>

                intuition is distressing to those who love her&#8212;among whom I may humbly but
                truly profess myself. It seems as if she were even <hi rend="underline">less</hi>
                capable than others of appreciating great work vital with the very marrow of her
                bones &#38; corpuscles of her blood: perhaps this very affinity is partly the
                reason&#8212;but at any rate a bad &#38; perverse reason. In this country there are
                of course very diverse knots of opinion, &#38; schools of thinking &#38; criticism,
                &#38; to several of these your

                works are still an exasperation &#38; an offence: but others
                accept &#38; exalt you with all readiness of love &#38; delight, &#38; I think I may
                safely say that it is these <choice>

                some years to come.&#8212;But I will say no more on this tack. For myself (with
                others) who believe in you with the certainty of full conviction, all these
                considerations are poor &#38; slight: the one thing is the work itself, &#38; the
                maker of the work, which has a destiny as assured &#38; as limitless as that of any
                other great product of the soul or of nature.</p>

                What I saw of him I liked
                particularly. He seems an uncommonly young man to be a Professor&#8212;less than 30
                to look at; &#38; is in no common degree good–looking, pleasant, open, &#38;

                right&#8212;guided also by the fullest measure of lettered cultivation. Mrs.
                    Gilchrist<ptr target="n0259"/> I dined with not many weeks ago. She seems to
                have fairly recovered from a very exhaustive &#38; indeed dangerous illness that
                oppressed her of late (say from the early autumn of 1870 to the late summer of
                1871)&#8212;only that she is not so capable as she used to be of continuous mental
                or bodily strain. It was a pleasure to see her surrounded by her family,

                The eldest son<ptr target="n2000"/> bids fair to have a distinguished &#38;
                prosperous career as a mining engineer: a younger son<ptr target="n0262"/> is
                greatly set on being a painter. One of the daughters<ptr target="n0260"/> is just
                about grown up, the other,<ptr target="n0261"/> I suppose, 10 or 11 years of

                wrote to me (2 or 3 letters) showing himself to have been for some while past one of
                your very ardent admirers. Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> I have known for years,
                &#38; like much: I think him deep–hearted &#38; high–minded, <choice>

                present a very obtuse exterior to their advances or approaches: for myself, I can
                truly say my experience is the direct contrary. I think you &#38; he <choice>
