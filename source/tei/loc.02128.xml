            <p>
                It is with profound
                sorrow that I read in the papers
                the news that you are again 
                suffering from your old trouble.
                I trust it is not so serious as
                reported. My regard for you is 
                so great that I am very sorry, not
                to be able to buy more copies of your
                books and thus give a more substantial
                token of sympathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic reader of
                your books, both volumes of which
                I have within reach of hand.
                I am, everywhere in my teaching
                and writing, making your claims
                felt and shall continue to do so.
           
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02128.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02128.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
                I have demonstrated (what of course 
                you know) that there is no veil&#8212;no
                impediment&#8212;between your mind
                and your audience, when your
                writings are <hi rend="underline">voiced.</hi> The formlessness
                is only seeming not real.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have never read a page
                of your poetry, or quoted a line,
                that has not commanded admiration.
                The music is there and the grandeur
                of thought is there, if the reader
                reads, guided by the sense and
                not by the external lining or paragraphing.
                Even very young pupils
                feel the thrill of the deep rolling
                music though the thought may be too
                profound for them to grasp.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a course of lectures before the
                Boston School of Oratory last summer
                I made a test of the matter. I do 
                not think a single pupil held out
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02128.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02128.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                against my arguments supplemented
                by readings from your work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trouble is they get at your work
                through the daily press or through the
                defenders of Longfellow or Tennyson (whom
                it is supposed you utterly antagonize).
                When it is brought to them by one 
                who appreciates and measurably understands
                your methods and ideals I 
                do not think there is any doubt
                of the favorable result. I have found
                much opposition but it was mostly
                ignorant &#38; misled.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a young man of very ordinary
                attainments and do not presume to
                do more than to give you a glimpse
                of the temper of that public which 
                would not do you wrong, deliberately,
                but who by reason of the causes
                hinted at above, fail to get at the
                transcendent power of "Leaves of Grass."
            </p>
            <p>
                If I have given you the impression
                that I believe in you and strive
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02128.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

                to interpret you, you will not 
                feel that I have over-stepped the
                privileges of a pupil in the presence of a great teacher.
            </p>

                The enclosed slip is a meagre
                out-line of a volume which I am
                writing and which I hope to get out this
                coming spring. As the motto-page
                of this volume I have used a paragraph
                from your "Collect" which
                is entitled "Foundation Stayed&#8212;then 
                Others." While it is not strictly
                essential to the book, yet I should
                esteem it a favor if you 
                consent to its use. One sentence,
                <hi rend="underline">"In nothing is there more evolution
                than in the American mind</hi>," 
                I have also used in company 
                with Spencer's great law of progress
                upon my title page. It helped
                to decide the title, which is: <hi rend="underline">The Evolution
                    of American Thought</hi>:<ptr target="loc.02128_n2"/> an outline
                study of the leading phases of American
                Literature etc. In the latter part

                of the volume I have treated of
                the Age of Democracy and its thought,
                taking as foundation the splendid
                utterances of Mr. Paine upon the modern
                age. It is in this chapter that
                I place your work. I quote from
                you quite largely both in treating
                of your writings and in treating
                the general theme of present and
                future democratic ideals. I hope
                to be able to please you with my
                treatment of your great work.
                Beside this I am preparing special
                lectures upon the same subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                Have you any objection to the
                quotations which I find if necessary
                to use? In conclusion let me 
                say that without any bias in your
                favor, (rather the opposite from newspapers)
                your poems thrilled me, reversed many
                of my ideas, confirmed me in others,
                helped to make me what I am. I 
                am a border-man; born in Wisconsin
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02128.010_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.02128.011_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                 and raised on the prairie &#38;
                frontier. I am a disciple of Mr. Spencer
                and therefore strive at comparative methods
                of criticism. That your poems should
                thus convert me, is to me a revelation
                of their power, especially when I can
                convince others in the same manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                And my revered friend (for I feel
                you are a friend) think of me as one
                who radiates the principles of the modern
                age, and who will in his best manner
                (poor at best) strive to make his hearers
                and readers better aware of the
                goodness and grandeur of the "Good 
                Gray Poet" and his elemental lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your readers are increasing, and
                may you live to see the circle
                infinitely extended, is my fervent hope.
                I do not expect a reply to this other
                than the signification whether I may
                quote you or not. I wish I might
                see and talk with you but that is not
                possible except through your volumes.
