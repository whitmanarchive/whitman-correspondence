               <salute>Dear Brother Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours I received yesterday  I also had a lettr from Mat to-day<ptr target="loc.00444_n2"/>  As you can imagine I am very glad to get news from home—I was glad you sent me Mothers letter—</p>
            <p>In regard to the house I think too that it is far better to do as you propose and build on George's lot—twill be a home and a good one too I think for Mother<ptr target="loc.00444_n3"/>—I see from Matts letter that they are going to be turned out from their place there—that Olmstead<ptr target="loc.00444_n4"/> and all the rest are a mean set of cusses as ever lived—there is no need of their wanting the house</p>
            <p>I hav'nt written to Kingsly<ptr target="loc.00444_n5"/> yet—am thinking of perhaps some other way of raising the money—anyway I am pretty sure—indeed <hi rend="italic">am</hi> sure that it can be had—how soon will you want it? write me about it—</p>
            <p>I am glad you went home<ptr target="loc.00444_n6"/>  I guess it did Mother and all of them a great deal of good—Mat writes that she is going out to hire rooms as soon as she can  It seems to me d—m mean that they manage to want the whole of that big house  It looks more like being a little ugly than anything else—I wish Mattie would be a little stiff with them—the Bullards<ptr target="loc.00444_n7"/> I mean the people that are going to move in—the d—m cusses shant have my water pipe unless the[y] behave decent—yet I suppose the Park people are mean enough to prevent my taking it up—</p>
            <p>Matters are beginning to get into shape with me—I am in need of Davis<ptr target="loc.00444_n8"/> very much—I have been urging him to come as soon as possible but received a letter to-day saying that he could not possibly get here before the 15th of June if then—I hope however that he will certainly get here by that time.</p>
            <p>Mr Kirkwood<ptr target="loc.00444_n9"/> left me this morning—he has been here since Saturday—The Board of Commis[sio]ners I like very much—they do just whatever I ask—at once—indeed almost too much so.<ptr target="loc.00444_n10"/> I begin to feel as if I should get along if I have decent luck—Yet it is hard to say what will turn up—</p>
            <p>I manage to get the N. York papers pretty regularly now. I had the Times of Friday while eating my Breakfast on Sunday—that is pretty well isnt it. The weather is quite cool—but nevertheless vegetation is getting forward fast—and just out side the city—where we are to build part of our new works, matters look perfectly beautiful. I hope you will be able to come on here and make me a visit if I stay here long—I begin to like the city better—Yet it dont come up to B[rooklyn] by a long chalk—</p>
            <p>Give my regards to Mr and Mrs O'Connor<ptr target="loc.00444_n11"/>—write me as often as you can</p>
