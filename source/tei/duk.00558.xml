                i received a letter from <choice><orig>heyde</orig><reg>Heyde</reg></choice><ptr target="duk.00469_n13"/> yesterday
                they all <choice><orig>jeff</orig><reg>Jeff</reg></choice><ptr target="duk.00422_n2"/> and all set in for me to send
            the letter to you and i thought i would last
            night but to day i thought better of it
            i thought it would only put you out
            of temper as it did all of us) he first
            began with saying <choice><orig>hanna</orig><reg>Hannah</reg></choice><ptr target="duk.00558_n12"/> was so she
            came out to the <choice><orig>kichen</orig><reg>kitchen</reg></choice> and eat her meals
            but she is very far from complete recovery
            she is very frail constitutionally yet
            her hand or rather her thumb by what he
            says is quite bad and the flesh <choice><orig>scrinks</orig> <reg>shrinks</reg></choice>
            from the bone) this may all be true
            probably is) then he goes on to say that
            she is better off with him that any change
            would not benefit her or to that affect
            with his <choice><orig>highfullatin</orig> <reg>highfulatin</reg></choice> phrases) well now
                for the second act) he says
            he received
            a very stupid letter from Walt addressed
            to han<ptr target="duk.00558_n17"/>
            which he humanely concluded not
            to deliver to her and then he goes on to
            quote the first part of the letter he says
            it ran thus) i suppose my dear sister
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="duk.00558.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            you are by this time perfectly recovered
            and the next) what a stupid man and

            is about nothing himself<ptr target="duk.00558_n11"/>
