            <p>Yours of the 25th<ptr target="n5002d"/> came duly. I hope there will be an effort made by the 
                creditors to push C. P. S.<ptr target="n0575"/> to the extremity of the law.</p>
            <p>That he obtained your goods &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="medium">service</unclear> under <hi rend="underline">false pretenses</hi>
                is perfectly certain to my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="low">mind</unclear>. I had placed confidence in him notwithstanding warnings from
                some <choice><sic>freinds</sic><corr>friends</corr></choice> who didn't like his looks &amp; even up to last <choice>
                    <abbr>Nov.</abbr>
                    <expan>November</expan>
                </choice> or <choice>
                    <abbr>Dec.</abbr>
                    <expan>December</expan>
                </choice> I put confidence in him &amp; did every possible thing to help him. In one
                of those months for example (I can't remember to a day) I offered to pay at least
                $100 in payment of <hi rend="underline">your</hi> claim in cash if he would let me
                have some property which he had no earthly use for viz some books which had once
                been in my private library a $150 bookcase which had been in my library <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01193.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01193.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 5 or 6 years
                before I thought of going into book business. He had much more shelving than he
                could use without it. In fact had some lying away entirely unused—I urged that
                it was his interest to pay you entire &amp; secure your new book then announced,
                &amp;c &amp;c To make a long story short I used every inducement to make him pay the
                debts but he either shuffled, evaded or refused to do any thing. I <choice>
                    <abbr>bo't</abbr>
                    <expan>bought</expan>
                </choice> one of the claims under his solemn promise to give me $25— towards
                it on a certain day in <choice>
                    <abbr>Dec.</abbr>
                    <expan>December</expan>
                </choice>. He utterly refused to let me have any money or even books which were mine
                under exemption laws had I elected to call them so. Since then I have not spoken to
                him or he to me. One of the creditors is now prosecuting him. <hi rend="underline">I</hi> paying lawyers fees. His defense is a lie.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01193.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I wish I could see you to give you all the points. However owing to a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="low">form</unclear> of the contract you
                have an advantage over the other creditors. In one place he binds himself to pay you
                $200.00 (just what was due <choice>
                    <abbr>Dec</abbr>
                    <expan>December</expan>
                </choice> 1st '74) In another place he binds himself to carry out all my contracts
                with you among other authors &amp;c. This last is quite unconditional. The first
                with other debts were to be paid in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">four proportions</unclear> as the goods were sold. Now do you know
                some able lawyer here in whom you have confidence who would make fees in accordance
                with the times &amp; my (&amp; your) purses? If so let me see him give him the
                points &amp; pay enough to begin operations. I will work, as I have done for 3 or 4
                years, day &amp; night &amp; sunday, to get justice out of this <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01193.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01193.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/> fellow for
                myself &amp; my creditors. Your case is in the best shape of any of them &amp; it is
                an outrage that you should not have been paid promptly <hi rend="underline">as he
                    most solemnly &amp; repeatedly promised me</hi> you should be. He represented
                that he had <hi rend="underline">several</hi> sources from which to obtain money
                each of which was quite beyond any contingency—(if you have no better
                acquaintance here) Perhaps the attorney of the suit (<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">Donely</unclear> &amp; Co's <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#smb">claims</unclear>) above named would do. I never knew him till 5 or 6 weeks
                since but am very well impressed. He is a man of some note, about your age &amp;
                quite moderate so far in his charges. Perhaps you can otherwise learn of his
                reliability. The name is H. F. Pultry,<ptr target="n5001"/> 67 Williams <choice>

                whether he can be made to pay up if it is not too much—</p>

            <p>I have been too hard at work in trying to pay other debts &amp; support my large
                family to attend to this before. Now I wish to go into the book business again &amp;
                I wish to get through with C. P. S. &amp; all the debts he left unpaid. If I can do
                this without bankruptcy I'll be glad—But I weary you—I don't wish to
                wait for you to come to N. Y. I want proceedings begun <hi rend="underline">at
                    once</hi>. Please let me hear promptly &amp; oblige</p>
