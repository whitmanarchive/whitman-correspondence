                <salute>Dear sir</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yours of the 25th came duly. I
                hope there will be an effort made by the editors to push C. F. S. to the <choice><sic>extremety</sic><corr>extremety</corr></choice>
                of the law.</p>
            <p>That he obtained your goods &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/> under <hi rend="underline">false</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">pretenses</hi> is perfectly certain to any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/>. I had placed confidence in Him
                notwithstanding warnings from some friends who didn't like his looks &amp; even up
                to last Nov. or Dec. I put confidence in him &amp; did every possible thing to help
                him. In one of those months for example (I can't remember to a day) I offered to pay
                at least $100 in payment of <hi rend="underline">your</hi> claim in cash if he would
                let me have some property which he had no earthly use for viz some books which had
                once been in my private library a $150 bookcase which had been in my library <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01193.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01193.005.jpg" type="recto"/> 5 or 6 years before I
                thought of going into book business. He had much more &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/> than he could use without it. In fact had some lying away
                entirely unused&#8212;I urged that it was his interest to pay you entire &amp;
                secure your new book there <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/><!-- amusement [?]-->, &amp;c &amp;c To make a long story short I used every
                inducement to make him pay the debts but he either shuffled, evaded or refused to do
                any thing. I got one of the claims under his solemn promise to give me $25 towards
                it on a certain day in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/>. He utterly refused
                to let me have any money on even books which were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/> under exemption laws that I elected to call them to. Since
                then I have not spoken to him on <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 words"/>. One of
                the creditors is now prosecuting him <hi rend="underline">&amp;</hi> paying lawyers
                fees. His defense is a lie.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01193.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01193.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I wish I could see you to give you all the points. However owing to a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/><!-- form [?]--> of the contract you have an
                advantage over the other creditors. In one place he binds himself to pay you
                    $200.00 (just what was due
                Dec 1st '74) In another place
                he binds himself to carry out all my contracts with you among other authors &amp;c.
                This last is quite unconditional
                <!-- might also read "This lost" instead of "This last" [ej] -->. The first with
                other debts were to be paid in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">four <choice>
                        <sic>perportions</sic>
                        <corr>proportions</corr>
                    </choice></unclear> as the goods were sold. Now do you know some able lawyer
                here in whom you have confidence who would make fees in accordance with the times
                &amp; my (&amp; your) purposes? If so let me see him give him the points &amp; pay
                enough to begin operations. I will work, as I have done for 3 or 4 years, day &amp;
                might &amp; sunday, to get justice out of this <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01193.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01193.009.jpg" type="recto"/> fellow for myself
                &amp; my editors. Your case is in the best shape of any of them &amp; it is an
                outrage that you should not have been paid promptly <hi rend="underline">as he most
                    solemnly &amp; repeatedly promised me</hi> you should be. He represented that he
                had <hi rend="underline">several</hi> sources from which to obtain money each of
                which was quite beyond any contingency&#8212;(if you have no better acquaintance
                here) perhaps the attorney of the suit (<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">Donely</unclear> &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words"/>)
                    <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words"/> above would do. I never knew him till
                5 or 6 weeks since but am very well impressed. He is a man of some note, about your
                age &amp; quite moderate so far in his charges. Perhaps you can otherwise learn of
                his reliability. The name is H. F. Pultry, 67 William's <choice>

            <p>I have been too hard at work in hoping to pay other debts &amp; support my large
                family to attend to this before. Now I wish to go into the book business again &amp;
                I wish to get through with C. F. S. &amp; all the debts he left unpaid. If I can do
                this without <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/> I'll be glad&#8212;But I
                weary you&#8212;I don't wish to wait for you to come to N. Y. I want proceedings
                begun <hi rend="underline">at once</hi>. Please let me hear promptly &amp;
