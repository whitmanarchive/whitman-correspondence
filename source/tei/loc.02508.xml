            </opener> 
            <p>Again have I to thank you for your kindness in sending us news of yourself—your
                pc of July 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi><ptr target="loc.02508_n2"/> coming to hand by last mail. 
                We note with pleasure that you were then "getting on about the same as ever" &amp; we are delighted 
                to know that our
                letters "help to cheer you up." <hi rend="underline">That</hi> is the greatest
                compliment you could pay them &amp; it is a genuine &amp; deep satisfaction &amp;
                joy to us</p>
            <p>I note also that you "half think" that one of my letters—dated Aug 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02508_n3"/>—
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02508.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> did not
                reach you &amp; in case this should be so I now send you a copy of it, from my
                draft.</p>
            <p>Yes, we have received the tomb<ptr target="loc.07329_n5b"/> photos &amp; are much pleased to have them. The tomb
                itself is truly Whitmanic in its design, its proportions, its situation &amp; its
                surrounding; tho', doubtless, as you say, its "best investments, vines, creepers
                &amp;c, are yet to come."</p>
            <p>I fancy the figure dimly seen through the foliage is that of H.L. Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/></p>
            <p>I thank you most cordially for sending such a loving message to

                offer to send him a copy of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02508_n4"/> I have mentioned
                this to Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> &amp; we both think that it would be a good
                thing if you were to do so, as it would probably be the means of introducing you to
                a class of men who otherwise would not hear of you; but as we wd prefer to pay for
                the book I enclose a p.o.o. value 21/-His address is:—

                <p>This is Wallace's birthday &amp; at his desire we have done nothing in the way of
                celebrating it beyond sending him letters &amp; making him a few
                presents—among these being the price of a return ticket to Camden N.J.!<ptr target="loc.02508_n5"/> And we
                regard it as a good omen that he has accepted it. May he soon be able to use it!</p>
            <p>He has written his letter to you here this evening &amp; has just returned to
                Anderton.</p>
            <p>We shall be anxious to hear about the effect of the great heat wave upon you.</p>
