            </opener>
            <p>Many thanks to you for your kind letter dated Sept 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                1890<ptr target="loc.02447_n1"/> and for the two letters<ptr target="loc.02447_n3"/> from 
                Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> to you which I will
                return by next mail.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear such a good account of your health and I hope it may continue to
                improve</p>
            <p>Thanks too for the domestic details and glimpses into your daily life which you favour
                me with, all of which possess a genuine and deep interest for me and which serve to
                vivify and deepen the ever-present and<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02447.002.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> ineradicable image &#38; memory of yourself and your surrounding and
                to recall the numerous &#38; unexampled 
                kindnesses you have shewed me</p>
            <p>Dr Bucke's letters are extremely interesting but two paragraphs are of especial
                interest to us here The first is that "Horace"<ptr target="n4267"/> (? H. L. Traubel)
                is preparing a new book about you&#8212;"W W to date."<ptr target="loc.07318_n1"/> Will you please kindly order
                    <hi rend="underline">two</hi> copies for me &#38; I will forward the cash when I
                know the price?</p>
            <p>The second is that he (Dr B.) will probably be in England before so long<ptr target="loc.02447_n5"/> &#38; will call 
                &#38; see "Johnston Wallace &#38; Co! (It sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> be W. J. &#38; Co!) This
                is news indeed! There is none of your friends whom I would like more to see than he
                &#38; <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02447.003.jpg" type="recto"/>there is no place
                where he would receive a warmer welcome than in Bolton among "the boys."<ptr target="loc.04708_n6"/> We are none
                of us wealthy but such as we have would be at his disposal during his stay among us.
                We have had many "Whitman evenings" but a "Whitman Evening" with Dr. Bucke in the
                    rostrum would be the climax of all 
                &#38; a life long remembrance. The thought of it is almost enough to take one's breath
                away&#8212;Let us hope it may not prove "too good to be true"!</p>
            <p>Our birthday "Surprise party" came off very successfully on the 25<hi

                supper "on the sly." Our arrival in a body surprised him, the giving of a reading-machine

               <p>fairly overwhelmed him.</p>
            <p>The inscription is a most artistic piece of work and the bordering is a beautifully
                executed design in leaves of grass, wild flowers &#38; "straw coloured &#38; other psyches"
                the whole being the work of W. M. Law<ptr target="loc.02447_n7"/> one of "the boys" &#38; a clever draughtsman<ptr target="loc.02447_n4"/></p>
