                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Many thanks to you for your kind letter dated Sept 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                1890 and for the two letters from Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> to you which I will
                return by next mail.</p>

            <p>I am glad to hear such a good account of your health and I hope it may continue to
                improve</p>
            <p>Thanks too for the domestic details and glimpses into your daily life which you favor
                me with, all of which possess a genuine and deep interest for me and which serve to
                vivify and deepen the ever-present and<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02447.002.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> ineradicable image + memory of yourself and your surrounding and
                to recall the numerous + <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="10"/>
                kindnesses you had shewed me</p>



            <p>Dr Bucke's letters are extremely interesting but two paragraphs are of especial
                interest to us here The first is that "Horace" (?H. L. Traubel)<ptr target="n4267"/>
                is preparing a new book about you&#8212;"W W to date." Will you please kindly order
                    <hi rend="underline">two</hi> copies for me + I will forward the cash when I
                know the price?</p>
            <p>The second is that he (Dr B) will probably be in England before so long + will call +
                see "Johnston Wallace + Co! (It sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> be W. J. + Co!) This
                is news indeed! There is none of your friends whom I would like more to see than he
                + <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02447.003.jpg" type="recto"/>there is no place
                where he would receive a warmer welcome than in Bolton among "the boys." We are none
                of us wealthy but such as we have would be at his disposal during his stay among us.
                We have had many "Whitman evenings" but a "Whitman Evening" with Dr. Bucke&#8212;the
                    <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="7"/> would be the climax of all +
                a life long remembrance. The thought of it is almost enough to take one's breath
                away&#8212;Let us hope it may not prove "too good to be true"!</p>
            <p>Our birthday "Surprise party" came off very successfully on the 25<hi
                    rend="underline">th</hi> and it proved to be a veritable surprise to our <hi
                    rend="underline">victim</hi><pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02447.004.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> the Revd F. R. C. Hutton MA who had not the slightest suspicion
                of our intentions although his own wife was in the plot and had prepared a grand
                supper "on the sly." Our arrival in a body surprised him, the <gap
                    reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="5"/> of a reading-machine
                inscribed&#8212;"to the Revd F. R. C. Hutton M. A.&#8212;'Something for a token'
                from the boys of the College" astonished him; but the presentation of the pocket
                book copy of L. of G. with an inscription&#8212;"to the Revd F. R. C. Hutton MA with
                all good wishes from the boys of the College and from Walt Whitman" fairly
                overwhelmed him.</p>
            <p>The inscription is a most artistic piece of work and the bordering is a beautifully
                executed design in leaves of grass, wild flowers + "straw coloured + other psyches"
                the whole being the work of W. M. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium"
                    resp="#ktl">Land</unclear> one of "the boys" + a clever draughtsman</p>
