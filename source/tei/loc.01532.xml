        <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letters of 10th and 12th have come safe, &amp; are welcome&#8212;dear son, I see you
        are hard at work &amp; appear to be in lively spirits&#8212;I am glad to hear you practice
        with the Arithmetic&#8212;I wish you to try &amp; do a little with it every
        day&#8212;practice makes perfect&#8212;you will see how soon &amp; how clear it will all
        come to you&#8212;If you have the Geography or Atlas, look into that a little too&#8212;one
        needs to have an idea of the world too. </p>

      <p>I am concerned to hear of the death of Amos Dye&#8212;poor Amos&#8212;he was one of the
        first (I don't know but the very first) of the railroad men there I got acquainted with,
        &amp; rode with&#8212;Pete, if there is any further subscription for Mrs. Dye, I authorize
        you to put me down for $5&#8212;I will either send the money, or give it to her when I
        return&#8212;</p>

      <p>I shall return in about three weeks. I am now in the eighth week of my furlough&#8212;it is
        seven weeks last Tuesday night since we parted there at the corner of 7th street. Well,
        Pete, dear loving boy, I must now close for to-day. </p>

      <postscript>
        <p rend="right">late Friday afternoon <lb/>Sept. 16. </p>

        <p>Dear son, I have time to add only a few words, in order to put it in the mail this
          evening&#8212;I am working a while every day at my printing yet&#8212;but I go around
          considerable&#8212;still go out in the bay&#8212;&amp; enjoy myself among my friends
          here&#8212;&amp; in riding around, &amp;c&#8212;The weather is very fine, both days &amp;
          nights. I don't know whether I told you how I stand now about the war&#8212;suffice it to
          say, that as things have gone on, &amp; as the case stands, I find myself now far more for
            <hi rend="italic">the French</hi> than I ever was for the Prussians<ptr
            target="loc.011532_n2"/>&#8212;</p>

        <p>Then I propose to take my first drink with you when I return, in celebrations of the
          pegging out of the Pope &amp; all his gang of Cardinals &amp; priests&#8212;&amp; the
          entry of Victor Emanuel<ptr target="n0217"/> into Rome, &amp; making it the capital of the great independent
          Italian nation.<ptr target="loc.011532_n3"/>
        </p>

        <p>Good bye till next time, darling boy. </p>
