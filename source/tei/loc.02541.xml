            </opener>
            <p>I send you my best &#38; warmest thanks for that transcendantly kind letter<ptr target="loc.02541_n2"/> 
                you sent to us by last mail &#38;
                which has stirred our hearts to their very depths, so overwhelming did we feel its 
                influence&#8212;That you 
                should undertake the trouble &#38; brave the exhaustion &#38; prostration which the effort induced, &#38;
                all for us is

                one of the most overpowering proofs of your affection for us that we have ever had &#38; we appreciate
                the tremendous compliment to the full.<ptr target="loc.02538_n4b"/></p>
            <p>Thanks &#38; again thanks to you, our noble and generous&#8211;hearted Benefactor!</p>
            <p>We took the words "facsimile from America" to imply that you would like the letter to be facsimiled
                &#38; copies sent to each of your English friends. Accordingly I have placed it in the hands of a 
                lithographer &#38; ordered him to strike off some 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02541.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                copies for us &#38; I expect to be able to send some off to you by next mail.</p>
            <p>We are sorely grieved to learn of your continued bad physical condition of of your "fearful sufferings"
                &#38; send you our continued &#38; deeply felt sympathy &#38; love</p>
            <p>It cheers us to know that you are so well looked after &#38; so kindly treated by all &#38; sundry</p>
            <p>The visit of your dear friend Col Ingersoll<ptr target="n0839"/> wh. 
                Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> told us about would cheer &#38; delight you greatly

                I have just returned from a flying visit to the home of my dear 
                sister<ptr target="loc.02519_n6"/>&#8212;near Carlisle, 100 miles
                from here&#8212;who is ill &#38; the journey there &#38; back in 18 hours &#38; my work 
                today have tired me somewhat.</p>
            <p>Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> &#38; I had a four mile walk through the snow 
                together the other night &#38; enjoyed a long &#38;
                loving talk about you</p>
            <p>I hope you are easier tonight. Good night to you Good sleep to you &#38; God bless you.</p>
