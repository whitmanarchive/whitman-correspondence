                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>1) The address of K. Elster<ptr target="n0216"/> is
                <address>
                    <addrLine>Mr. Kristian Elster</addrLine>
                    <addrLine>Strandgade 38</addrLine>
                    <addrLine>Throndhjem</addrLine>
                    <addrLine>Norway</addrLine>
                </address>
            </p>
            <p>2) I wrote in the midst of March a long letter to you in a large yellow <choice><sic>enveloppe</sic><corr>envelope</corr></choice>;<ptr target="syr.00007_n1"/>—have you received it?</p>
            <p>3) I should be glad, if John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> would send me his photography; tell him that I 
                like his book very much.</p>
            <p>I received in March or April with an interval of eight days both the prayer of Columbus and 
                The redwood Tree<ptr target="loc.02875_n1"/> in Harper's Magazine.<ptr target="n6009"/> 
                Of the redwood Tree I have had the greatest. It is your old great theme 
                in a simple and powerful <choice><sic>stile</sic><corr>style</corr></choice>, 
                embracing the holy and original nation of the far West.</p>
            <p>5) I am very glad to be furnished with new materials concerning the American humor. In these waggish gasconades 
                lies the em<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr.00007.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>bryon                     
                of a comical poet greater than any of the old world's in present and past. But you, your humourists of the day 
                I don't like. Mark Twain<ptr target="ucb.00961_n2"/> has been translated into Danish this year. He is a detestable fool.</p>
            <p>6) Clemens Petersen's<ptr target="n0780"/> letter has amused me very much. His force is the psychological critic, 
                the analyzing power, which he can't use in America, where the <hi rend="underline">words</hi> have too much
                to do to follow such subtle explorings. Therefore he has had to be poetical traveller; but his fancy is 
                important and he has no great sum of observation. In Sweden he never has had his foot. 
                Touching is what he speaks of "a letter from your mother". His mother, which he never shall see more,
                is the only <choice><sic>beeing</sic><corr>being</corr></choice> in the world, which he loves. 
                I should be glad to have the continuation of his letters.</p>
            <p>7) I have sent you all the criticisms on your book, slang, chatter and earnest critic—all the criticism in 
                "Dags Telegrafen"<ptr target="n0177"/> is good, but the best is Elster's. I got the number of "Aftenbladet"<ptr target="syr.00007_n2"/> 
                here in Kopenhagen and sent it you for security's sake; probably it has also been sent you from Norway. It should 
                interest me to know what impression also these varie<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr.00007.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>gated
                 opinions have made on you. Particularly I long to hear, if the criticism of Elster has been completely translated 
                 to you.</p>
            <p>8) Has this translation of your book into Danish<ptr target="n0189"/> not been spoken of in the American papers?</p>
            <p>May the line meet you in good health and <choice><sic>joyfull</sic><corr>joyful</corr></choice>. Do you understand my bad English?</p>
