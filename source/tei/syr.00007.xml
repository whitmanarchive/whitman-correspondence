                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>1) the address of K. Elster is</p>
            <p>Mr. Kristian Elster</p>
            <p>Strandgade 38</p>
            <p><unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Throndhjem</unclear></p>
            <p>Norway</p>
            <p>2) I wrote in the midst of March a long letter to you in a large yellow envelope;&#8212;have you received it?</p>
            <p>3) I should be glad, if John Burroughs would send me his photography; tell him that I like his book very much.</p>
            <p>I received in March or April with an interval of eight days both the pages of Columbus and The redwood Tree in Harper's Magazine. Of the redwood Tree I have had the greatest. It is your old great theme in a simple and powerful tale, embracing the holy and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#al">original</unclear> nation of the far West.</p> <!-- you left off here -NNK -->
            <p>5) I am very glad to be furnished with new materials concerning the American humor. In these waggish gasconades like the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#al" cert="medium">embryon</unclear>

            of a comical poet greater than any of the old world's in present and past. But <choice><sic>you your</sic><corr>your</corr></choice> humourists of the day I don't like. Mark Twain has been translated into Danish this year. He is a detestable fool.</p>
            <p>6)<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">Clemen Petersen's</unclear> letter has amused me very much. His force is the psychological critic, the analyzing power, which he can't use in America, where the words have too much to do to follow such subtle explorings. Therefore he has had to be poetical traveller; but his fancy is important and he has no great <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">sum</unclear> of observation. In Sweden he never has had his foot. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Touching</unclear> is what he speaks of "a letter from your mother." His mother, which he never shall see more, is the only being in the world, which he loves. I should be glad to have the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">continuation</unclear> of his letters.</p>
            <p>7) I have sent you all the criticism on your book, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">slang</unclear>, chatter and earnest <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">critic&#8212;all!</unclear> the criticism in "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Dagohelegraphen</unclear>" is good, but the best is Elster's. I got the number of "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Aftenblaket</unclear>" here in <choice><orig>Kopenhagen</orig><reg>Copenhagen</reg></choice> and sent it you for security's sake; probably it has also been sent you from Norway. It should interest me to know what impression also the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">varigated</unclear>

                 opinions have made on you. <choice><sic>Paticuly</sic><corr>Particularly</corr></choice> I long to hear, if the criticism of Elster has been completely translated to you.</p>
            <p>8) Has this translation of your book into Danish not been spoken of in the American papers?</p>
            <p>May the line meet you in good health and <choice><sic>joyfull</sic><corr>joyful</corr></choice>. Do you understand my bad English?</p>
