                express my feelings. 
                Tis the first time I have had the pleasure of gazing up on the picture of my Great 
                Great Uncle Elias Hicks.</p> 
            <p>I shall always cherish the memory of Walt Whitman and this beautiful and instructive Volume November boughs.</p>

            <p>When this life shall have ceased to cherish the book thou hast so kindly presented me, 
                it shall fall to the pocession of your name sake Fred Whitman Van Tassel.<ptr target="loc.04352_n2"/></p>
            <p>In return for this precious gift, I shall present you his picture, which shall be taken expressly 
                for you, may his baby face please you, he is just two years old.</p>
            <p>Mr Whitman, I have no father now, he passed peacefully a way to his heavenly rest, Six years 
                a go, since he has gone I miss his kindly face, and his tender love. He was to me a Mother,
                he loved his Grand children dearly, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_zs.00179.jpg" type="recto"/>
                Since God took his life have been weary and dreary, but 
                with the radiant hope of meeting him in the bright here after. I have patiently submited to 
                the will of God, it is through him I breathe, live, and have my being.</p>
            <p>Father and Mother gone, a <choice><sic>vacency</sic><corr>vacancy</corr></choice> is felt 
                never to be replaced <choice><sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr></choice> we meet on that

            <p>Trusting the Spirit of Jesus is hovering over and administering into your comforts, I close 
                with much thankfulness of the heart for your great generosity in the presentation of so 
                worthy a Volume, November boughs.</p>
