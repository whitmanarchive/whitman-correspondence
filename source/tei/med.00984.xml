            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>Well, election times are over. We have
                recovered from the heat and burden of the battle, and most folks breathe freer."
                Taylor<ptr target="med.00989_n10"/> is President, the republic is comparatively quiet for about three years—quiet
                at least on one great subject—and the Universal Yankee Nation is "saved." How
                splendidly the Northern States, the biggest and richest of them voted for your
                Louisiana Planter! Does this look like a spite towards the South? That feeling
                which some mistaken gents in your latitude (though not precisely in your longitude)
                are so fond of ascribing to us! For my part I confess I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> vote for the old
                General, but I am willing to see all the good developments of the election,
                nevertheless. To me it is a beautiful thought, that the "fraternity" which forms the
                third ingredient in what Monsieur Crapeau<ptr target="n5001"/> is after, already exists—with "liberty"
                and an elsewhere unequalled amount of "equality"—in this Republic. Whoever doubts
                it, look at the grand majorities in Pennsylvania and New York, for the old
                Southerner, Taylor—and when convinced, make a note of, and don't babble of
                "sectional feeling" any more.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>New York, about these times, is most musically
                pervaded. We have had the Germania Musical Society, a company of twenty-five
                splendid performers, led by Tenschow,<ptr target="med.00984_n8"/> the German composer—a remarkable and superior
                band. Now we have Gung'l's Band—Josef Gung'l,<ptr target="med.00984_n7"/> haven't you heard of him and his
                "three tact time," and his folks? Oh, if you haven't you had better set about it,
                because the musical critics say that he is "great:" and besides that, his corps will
                make a circle around the land, and take in New Orleans by the way.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>Do you see
                that New York sends two editors to Congress? Greeley<ptr target="med.00972_n1"/> goes this winter, 
                and Brooks<ptr target="med.00984_n9"/>
                (of the Express) next. Well, well, it's lucky the two are to be separated by the
                distance of nine months—for their interminable bickerings and pen-fights have kept
                the partisans of each on fire, for months and months past. Greeley is likely to do
                good, if he would but try, on such points as Postoffice reform, giving the election
                of officers to the people, wherever practicable, and such like. But the probability
                is, that he will leave all these, and try for the chimerical and
                never-to-be-accomplished establishment of a "Protective Tariff," or some such
                by-gone nonsense.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>New York, now-a-days, is brilliant and busy, with crowds of
                strangers. General Butler,<ptr target="med.00952_n2"/> Mrs. Polk,<ptr target="med.00984_n5"/> the 
                Van Burens,<ptr target="med.00984_n6"/> and divers more celebrities,
                are to be seen in Broadway, of a morning, or at some place of entertainment in the
                evening. Poor Manager Fry!<ptr target="med.00988_n7"/> His very name is descriptive of the condition of a
                musical director. He has more sulking and quarrelling and hair pulling to trouble
                him than any other mortal soul. He holds a tight rein, however, and will either make
                or break—probably the latter.</p>
