                <salute>Dear Whitman</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>(If you will permit me to drop the "Mr.")—I write in some haste. Yours of 26 Jan. &amp; 11 Feb. received.<ptr target="loc.01886_n2"/></p>
            <p>Ever since we in England heard that your health had received a serious shock, we have had it much at heart, 
                I assure you, to testify our love, respect &amp; gratitude, in some tangible shape: &amp; I 
                <choice><abbr>c.d</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> at this moment tell you of at least 3 several plans 
                <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> were actively mooted, &amp; 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01886.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                partly started. Our ideas on the subject have shifted according to the varying accounts that reached us, 
                more especially with regard to the material comforts of your present mode of life. As the extract 
                <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> you send me from the West Jersey Press, &amp; 
                <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> you vouch for as less strong than the facts, 
                proves that some more cheerful preceding accounts were not accurate, there are some of us who 
                <choice><abbr>w.d</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice> really be glad to exert ourselves to the extent of 
                our moderate means, to prove that we are not insensible of the obligations we owe 
                you. <choice><abbr>Profr.</abbr><expan>Professor</expan></choice> Dowden<ptr target="n0199"/> of Dublin, 
                &amp; myself, have more especially been in frequent written 
                com<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01886.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>munication 
                on this subject, &amp;, if I hear from you in terms to warrant, my so doing, I shall call the attention of others to the subject.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0259"/> &amp; I agreed on the 25th that we <choice><abbr>w.d</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice> 
                at once ask you to oblige each of us with copies of your forthcoming books<ptr target="loc.01235_n1"/> to the 
                value of £5 (25 dollars, I believe this is) each. This morning I saw about getting the requisite letter of 
                credit for the amount, £10, &amp; it will no doubt be procured &amp; transmitted to you very shortly. 
                I <choice><abbr>c.d</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> not find any suitable locality nearer 
                than New York mentioned in the Bank documents.—Mrs. G. <choice><abbr>w.d</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice>
                wish her books to be copies of the Two 
                Ri<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01886.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>vulets 
                <hi rend="underline">only</hi>. I <choice><abbr>sh.d</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> wish for 
                The Two Rivulets, &amp; also the forthcoming edition of your poems, in whatever proportions may be 
                most convenient, &amp; suitable for making up the £5.</p>
            <p>I sent the substance of the West Jersey Press article to the Academy,<ptr target="loc.02532_n6"/> but regret to 
                find the Editor not forward to publish it: if he fails, I will send it elsewhere. Will also lose no time in 
                offering for publication the poem &amp; prose-matter <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> you 
                forwarded to me—&amp; both of <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> 
                I read with great interest. I trust I may succeed in all these points.</p>
            <p>Arthur Clive (so Dowden in<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01886.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>formed 
                me long ago) is really Standish O'Grady,<ptr target="n0453"/> an Irish barrister of good position (or good
                prospects, I forget which). As it happens, I have not yet seen his article.</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>Dowden has mentioned to me your "Autograph Edition," but without defining what it is, nor do I precisely know.
                    It sounds tempting, so I hope Mrs. Gilchrist &amp; I may come in for some specimen of it.</p>
