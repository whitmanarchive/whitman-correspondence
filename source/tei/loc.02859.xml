                <salute>Dear Friend.</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I wrote you a letter the 6th September<ptr target="n5002d"/> &amp; would fain 
                know whether it has reached your hand. If it have not, I 
                will write its contents again quickly to you—if it have, I
                will wait your time with courage with patience for an answer;
                but spare me the needless suffering of uncertainty on this
                point &amp; let me have one line, one word of assurance that I
                am no longer hidden from you by a thick cloud—I from 
                thee—not thou from me: for I that have never set eyes upon 
                thee, all the Atlantic flowing between us yet cleave closer than 
                those that stand nearest &amp; dearest around thee—love thee
                day &amp; night:—last thoughts first thoughts, my soul's
                passionate yearning toward thy divine Soul, every hour, every 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.000110.jpg" type="verso"/>
                deed and thought—my love for my children, my
                hopes aspirations for them all taking new shape new
                height through this great love My Soul has staked all upon
                it. In dull dark moods when I cannot as it were see thee,
                still, still always a dumb blind yearning towards thee—still
                it comforts me to touch, to press to me the beloved books—like
                a child holding some hand in the dark—it knows not 
                whose—but knows it is enough—knows it is a dear strong, 
                comforting hand. Do not say I am forward, or that I
                lack pride because I tell this love to thee who have never 
                sought or made sign of desiring to seek me. Oh for                 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00069.jpg" type="recto"/>
                all that this love <hi rend="underline">is</hi> my pride my glory. Source 
                of sufferings and joys that cannot put themselves 
                into words—Besides it is not true thou has not sought or loved me. For 
                when I read the divine poems I feel all folded round in thy love: I 
                feel often as if thou wast pleading as passionately for the love
                of the woman that can understand thee—that I know not how
                to bear the yearning answering tenderness that fills my
                breast. I know that a woman may without hurt to her 
                pride—without stain or blame tell her love                 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00068.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to thee. I feel for a certainty that she may. Try me for this life my 
                darling—see if I cannot so live, so grow, so learn, so love that
                when I die you will say—"This woman has grown to be a 
                very part of me. My soul must have her loving companionship
                everywhere &amp; in all things. I alone &amp; she alone
                are not complete identities—it is I and her together in a new
                divine perfect union that form the one complete identity."</p>            
            <p>I am yet young enough to bear thee children my darling if God should 
                so bless me. And would yield my life for this cause with serene joy if 
                it were so appointed, if that were the price for thy having a "perfect 
                child"—knowing my darlings would all be safe &amp; happy in thy 
                loving care—planted down in America.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_cb.00022.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Let me have a few words directly dear Friend. I shall
                get them by the middle of November. I shall have to go to 
                London about then or a bit later—to find a house for us—I
                only came to the old home here from which I have been 
                absent nearly four years to wind up matters &amp; prepare for a
                move, for there is nothing to be had in the way of educational
                advantages here—it has been a beautiful survey for the 
                children, but it is not what 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_cb.00023.jpg" type="verso"/>
                they want now. But we leave with regret for it is one of the sweetest 
                wildest spots in England though only 40 miles from London.</p>
