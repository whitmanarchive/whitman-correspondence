            </opener>
            <p> My best thanks to you for your kind p.c. of Aug 28<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr
                    target="loc.02516_n1"/> in which you say that you are "delighted" at the
                prospect of "seeing W.<ptr target="n6121"/> &#38; B.<ptr target="n0119"/> so soon."<ptr target="loc.02516_n2"/></p>
            <p> As I have seen no intimation of the arrival of the "British Prince" up to date, 
                tho' she was due at Phila. yesterday, I presume she
                has been delayed by the contrary <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.02516.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> winds &#38; will probably arrive
                today. In that case Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> will see you face to face for the
                first time today and perhaps at this moment 7.20 p.m here&#8212;about 2.20 pm with
                you&#8212;he is sitting by your side &#38; holding sweetest of sweet converse with
                you. Somehow I have a feeling that he is either with you or very near to you as I
                write this, &#38; I should like to know the exact time &#38; date when he does see
                you first. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02516.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> How
                memorable that meeting will be &#38; how pregnant with vast issues not only for him
                but for us all none of us can tell &#38; I love to dwell upon it &#38; I long to
                participate in its great joys&#8212;nay I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> participate
                in them in spirit.</p>
            <p>By this time you will have received a copy of W. Dixon's<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>
                admirable report of "The College Farewell to Dr. Bucke &#38;
                J.W. Wallace"&#8212;multiplexed by T. Shorrock<ptr
                    target="loc.02448_n8"/>&#8212;from which you will be able to gather something of our
                doings upon that memorable evening&#8212;a <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02516.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> sort of parallel to your Birthday
                spree,<ptr target="loc.03027_n3"/> &#38; some of us flatter ourselves that it was nearly as good as yours!</p>
            <p>
                <date when="1891-09-09"><hi rend="underline">Wed Sept 9. 91</hi></date> At last we
                have word of J.W.W's ship's arrival in Phila &#38; glad are we all to hear of it. My
                heart goes out to you both for now I <hi rend="underline">Know</hi> that you have
                met &#38; are now near each other. God bless you both!</p>
            <p> I have my dear good old mother<ptr target="loc.02519_n5"/> staying with me at present &#38; proud indeed am I to
                be with her</p>
            <p> My sister<ptr target="loc.02519_n6"/> &#38; her bonnie <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02516.005_large.jpg"
                type="recto"/> wee boy<ptr target="n5001"/>&#8212;4 years old&#8212;are also here. He delights me
                with his delicious prattle &#38; childish ways &#38; is very fond of "Uncle John"
                who I am afraid spoils him&#8212;we have no children of our own.</p>
            <p>I send you a paper &#38; a photo wh. I think will interest you. (Please give
                the duplicates to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38; Mrs. D.)<ptr
                    target="n6113"/> Together they form a record of an event of which I am
                proud&#8212;The Society wh made me the unexpected presentation of a testimonial is
                composed entirely of workmen&#8212;factory men foundry men &#38;c.&#8212;&#38; to me
                it is very gratifying <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02516.006_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> to receive this token of their appreciation &#38; respect tho,'
                as I told them, I do not see why the simple performance of one's duty, for wh they
                    <hi rend="underline">pay</hi> me, should merit any exceptional recognition</p>
            <p>I trust you are keeping better by this time&#8212;Perhaps JWW's &#38; Dr B's visits
                may give you a bit of a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">fillip</unclear>. </p>
            <p>Please thank HLT<ptr target="n4267"/> for his kind letter of 28th Aug<ptr target="n5002d"/></p>
            <closer>
                <salute>with kindest regards to him &#38; to all your house &#38; with best love to
                    yourself</salute>
