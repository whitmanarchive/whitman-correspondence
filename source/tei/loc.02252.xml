            <p>Allow me to express my ineffable gratefulness to you for the immense delight your
                "Leaves of Grass" have thrilled me with, in the form of a few of my rhapsodies which
                I take pleasure in committing to you&#8212;though, I fancy I shall survive minus
                encouragement, it would be infinitely</p>

            <p>agreeable to me to receive any cheer you may be disposed to render me&#8212;Mr.
                Emerson's recommends of your work secured you a very nice introduction to the world,
                and, perhaps, I should become as famous(!) under the ban of your warm regards for my
                poetic productions&#8212;(properly belonging to the 21 &#38; 22 centuries.)</p>

            <p>Like our great poets,I, too, am familiar with straitened circumstances..&#8212;Being,
                now, in a position, that would find a small-fortune a great blessing:&#8212;since, I
                do not seem to be endowed with the worldly tact or talent for making lucre&#8212;I
                have, however, amassed material both poetical and philosophical for volumes, as soon
                as ever,</p>

                the public&#8212;But they were the poorest specimens of my work&#8212;Had it been
                otherwise&#8212;that is, one of my most select copies,&#8212;the people would have
