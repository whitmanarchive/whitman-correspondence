            <p>I went in H. Williams &#38; Everetts<ptr target="loc.02912_n1"/> this evening after
                work, &#38; passed a few rapt moments in looking at the bust of you which is
                handsomely mounted on a polished wood tall pedestal standing on the middle landing
                of the stairs &#38; just before a pier glass mirror&#8212;The very best position in
                the rooms. I then saw <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02912.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> that I had not really seen it at all in the right
                way&#8212;before (I mean) it was on a pedestal &#38; viewed at a distance. I gave it
                draining regards that fixed it in my mind. I regard it as a noble work, &#38; am
                very glad of this rich honor done to my poet, &#38; I want to congratulate Morse
                very heartily on it. It is a fine, nay a great, work, in my opinion.</p>
