                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>Coming home from our "Athenaeum"—a great reading union with a large 
                number of papers and periodicals from all countries of the earth—and having there with 
                great pleasure read in the Norwegian "Aftenbladet"<ptr target="n5006"/> (Evening Paper) for 
                April 1 the the first <hi rend="underline">real</hi> criticism of your book, I found on my table 
                your kind letter of March 19,<ptr target="loc.01911_n1"/> in reply to which I immediately write 
                these lines to let you know the fact. 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01911.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                The author is a young man in my years; his name is Kristian Elster,<ptr target="n0216"/> he is 
                living at present in Throndhjeim (English: Drontheim). I received a letter from him this morning 
                of March 28 announcing that he had written the criticism but expressing a great fear that the 
                editor (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the roaring sea the Norwegians are 
                a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they are a race of cowards. Either the 
                author or the editor will forward a copy of the number to you. I will beg you to let it be 
                <hi rend="underline">carefully</hi> translated to you. Elster speaks of a certain affinity between 
                the author and his translator, others have made 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01911.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                the same remark.</p>
            <p>In the whole I have sent you 1) Fædrelandet 2) Nær og fjern.<ptr target="n0430"/> 
                3) Dagbladet<ptr target="loc.01911_n3"/> 4) Folkets Avis.<ptr target="loc.01911_n4"/> 
                The last paper (people's paper) is <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#aja">slang</unclear> 
                and the editor is the clown of the basest Copenhagen public.</p>
            <p>All the other critics have been in the same case with you as during many years our critics have 
                been with Grundtvig:<ptr target="loc.01911_n2"/> when the objections against the books are exhausted, 
                <hi rend="underline">the man</hi> is standing there invulnerable against all the darted arrows and 
                imposing the critic himself!</p>
            <p>And therefore your adversaries here are at the bottom your friends. But your proper friends are among 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01911.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                the peasantry and the teachers of the village schools and the <hi rend="underline">very few</hi>, 
                to whom culture has been no poison (among these especially the women.)</p>
            <p>I am very glad to hear that your brother and sister<ptr target="n1046"/> are with you in your lonesomeness.</p>
            <p>I should be glad to know some thing about John Burroughs;<ptr target="n0129"/> his book has made 
                his individuality dear to me.</p>
            <p>Here follows a photography<ptr target="n5002f"/> that gives a true idea of my stature;—the 
                face is not good.</p>
