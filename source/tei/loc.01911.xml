            The author is a young man in my years; his name is Kristian Elster, he is living at present in Throndhjem (English: Drontheim). I received a letter from him this morning of March 28 announcing that he had written the criticism but expressing a great fear that the editor (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">running sea</unclear> the Norwegians are a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they are a race of cowards.  Either the author or the editor will forward a copy of the number to you. I will beg you to let it be <hi rend="underline">carefully</hi> translated to you. Elster speaks of a certain affinity between the author and his translator, others have <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">made</unclear>

            the same remark.</p>

The last paper (people's paper) is <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ej">long</unclear> and the editor is the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">donor</unclear> of the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">basest</unclear> Copenhagen public.</p>
            
            <p>All the other critics have been in the same case with you as during many years our critics have been with <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ej">Grundtvig </unclear><!-- Ashley reads this as Genius vig; Grundtvig was an 18th Danish author -->: when the objections against the books are exhausted, <hi rend="underline">the man</hi> is <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">standing</unclear> then <!-- or there[#ej]? --> invulnerable against all the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">dated</unclear> errors <!-- or arrows [#ej]? --> and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">exposing</unclear><!-- or inspecting [#ej]? --> the critic himself!</p>
