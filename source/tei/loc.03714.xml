                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Our good friend William D. O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> died this morning about 2
                o'clock.</p>
            <p>I doubt not that you will have been informed by his friends, or by the press, but as
                it was my lot to be closely associated <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03714.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>with him for several months before
                he was forced to keep to the house, and as he often talked of you (I know from your
                books that you loved him, and I know that he loved you), I am impelled to write you
                the sad intelligence of the morning.</p>
            <p>He seemed hopeful through the last weeks of his illness, but did not fear the End. He
                had often said to me that his greatest fear was years of bedridden
                lingering&#8212;such as sometimes accompanies maladies kindred to his. Often he quoted: "Come quickly, O beautiful
                Death!" and now that it has come <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.03714.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>we cannot wish him back to that
                  shattered tenement of clay.</p>
                <p>Peace to his ashes!</p>
            <p>I have not seen you, Walt Whitman, but it is not necessary to see you in order to
                know you, and I send you my love</p>
