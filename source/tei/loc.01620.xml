                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>  
            </opener>

            <p>Some years ago when I had occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy 
                to hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever concerns you 
                have rather strengthened than weakened, I feel sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.</p>

            <p>As a faithful student of your books, I have made it my business to obtain every edition I could, 
                and all portraits and notable 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01620.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                notable accounts and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able 
                to see even,&#8212;that mentioned by Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> as having been issued in 
                1856<ptr target="loc.01620_n2"/> in 16 mo.<space dim="horizontal" extent="4 letters"/>The American 
                agent to whom my last application for this was forwarded says: "I don't think there is an 1856 edition. 
                There is one earlier or later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25&#36; to 30&#36;; 
                but I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the above".</p>

            <p>Can you tell me whether there is or is not an edition between the 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01620.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                the one set up by yourself in 1855<ptr target="loc.02472_n12"/> and that of Thayer &amp; Eldridge<ptr target="loc.00576_n100"/> 
                dated 1860&#8211;61? If there is, can you give me any particulars that will help me towards buying 
                it? Also, what is the edition that fetches 25&#36; to 30&#36;? Not that of 1855; for I hear that 
                can be had for 3 or 4.</p>

            <p>When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's<ptr target="n0547"/> a few weeks ago, I saw a proof of a fine portrait 
                of you engraved by Linton:<ptr target="n0360"/> may I ask what it is from, and where it is published?</p>

            <p>I live in hopes of publishing some day a good English Edition of your works; and my enquiries about editions 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01620.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my experience is that the careful 
                collations of various versions of a poet's work is often a key as well as an incitement to the right 
                understanding of his spirit and intent.</p>

            <p>I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelley<ptr target="med.00858_n13"/> which will be the handsomest 
                in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published; and that takes up most of my time.</p>
