                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Some years ago when <choice>
                    <orig>Ihad</orig>
                    <reg>I had</reg>
                </choice> occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy to
                hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever
                concerns you have rather strengthened than weakened, <choice>
                    <orig>Ifeel</orig>
                    <reg>I feel</reg>
                </choice> sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.</p>

            <p>As a faithful student of your books, <choice>
                    <orig>Ihave</orig>
                    <reg>I have</reg>
                </choice> made it my business to obtain every edition I could, and all portraits and
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01620.002.jpg" type="verso"/>notable accounts
                and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able
                to see ever,&#8212;that mentioned by Rossetti<!-- <ptr target="n0522"/> --> as having been
                issued in 1856 in 16 ms <!-- maybe "mo"? -NNK -->.<space dim="horizontal" extent="4 letters"/>The American agent to whom my last application for this was
                forwarded says: "I don't think there is an 1856 edition. There is one earlier or
                later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25 $ to 30 $; but
                I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the
                above".</p>


            <p>Can you tell me whether there is or not an edition between <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01620.003.jpg" type="recto"/>the one set up by yourself in 1855 and
                that of Thayer &amp; Eldridge<!-- <ptr target="n0801"/> --> dated 1860-61? If there is, can you give me any
                particulars that will help me towards buying it? Also, what is the edition that
                fetches 25 $ to 30 $? Not that of 1855; for I hear that can be had for 3 or
                4.</p>

            <p>When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's<!-- <ptr target="n0547"/> --> a few weeks ago, I saw a proof
                of a fine portrait of you engraved by Linton<!-- <ptr target="n0360"/> -->: may I ask what it
                is from, and where it is published?</p>

            <p>I live in hopes of publishing some day a good hybrid edition of your works; and my
                enquiries about <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01620.004.jpg" type="verso"/>editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my
                experience is that the careful collations of various versions of a poet's work is
                often a key as well as an incitement to the right understanding of his spirit and
                intent.</p>

            <p>I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelly<!-- <ptr target="n0559"/> --> which will be
                the handsomest in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published;
                and that takes up most of my time.</p>
