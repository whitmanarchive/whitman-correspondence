                <salute>Dear friend&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have already acknowledged yours of 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><ptr target="pri.00018_n1"/>&#8212;Mine of 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> will have advised you of the situation here, &amp; the general character 
                of my wishes, the way things have shaped themselves in London&#8212;Whatever I should do, if I had the planning 
                of it <hi rend="underline">de novo</hi>, the question is now (like a general making the best of the turn the battle has taken in its 
                own hands, &amp; <choice><abbr>compell'd</abbr><expan>compelled</expan></choice> to decide quickly &amp; definitely,) what to direct &amp; authorize under the circumstances&#8212;While I unhesitatingly accept such kind offerings as <choice><abbr>Chas</abbr><expan>Charles</expan></choice> W Reynell's<ptr target="pri.00018_n4"/> (No 1. in your transcript) and J Leicester Warren<ptr target="pri.00018_n12"/> (No 2)&#8212;&amp; authorize you or any of my friends to continue to accept the like, in my name, where <choice><abbr>offer'd</abbr><expan>offered</expan></choice> 
                readily &amp; properly, I'd rather you would, after receiving this, either, (to use nautical lingo,) <hi rend="underline">take in sail</hi>, 
                or at least don't crowd on any more sail at all. The whole business requires to be done with perfect candor 
                to my generous friends&#8212;to you &amp; the other mediums of that generosity&#8212;&amp; to myself&#8212;&amp; must &amp; shall be so done. 
                Of the cheque (No 1) or any other, or any thing of the kind sent by you or through you or any of my friends, 
                the most convenient to me would be to have them remitted to me, to my address here, drawn on some well-known 
                New York or Philadelphia banker, <hi rend="underline">payable to my order</hi>&#8212;(if in Philadelphia, on Drexel &amp; Co. bankers, 
                34 south 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> street.)<ptr target="pri.00018_n13"/>
                 Then the p.o. international money order is also a good &amp; safe way to remit&#8212;I should like in all cases to have the full &amp; explicit address of the friend &amp; giver, to send him or her 
                at least one special autograph copy, or set, of my books&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="pri.00018.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>As told you in former letter,<ptr target="pri.00018_n2"/> although I am indeed poor, with means exhausted, I am by no means 
                in a condition of pinching want, nor likely to be. I am boarding here, under the usual, unavoidable expenses. 
                I accept the kind gifts, first for my own help, then perhaps somewhat for the still graver needs of others, 
                forever falling in my way. For the future I really think the income from my books, if it can be utilized, 
                promises amply enough for my support&#8212;&amp; <hi rend="underline">that</hi> decidedly would be most satisfactory to me&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Probably from the tinge of Quaker breed in me the inner convictions &amp; silent dictates of <hi rend="underline">the spirit</hi> 
                settle these cases, &amp; what I must do in them, more than reason, convention or even delicacy&#8212;&amp; those inner dictates 
                I have now obeyed in the decisions of this letter, as <hi rend="underline">a higher reason &amp; delicacy</hi>, 
                &amp; the final arbiter of the question.

                    published at once, making any decent terms you can&#8212;But if there don't appear to be any danger, take your leisure, 
                    &amp; hold on. See if you can get any one to pay me something down ahead&#8212;I revoke what I <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="pri.00018.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
