            <p>Still here in my big chair in the sick room yet—a coolish wave to-day, but
                pleasant enough—John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> has been to see me, the good hearty
                affectionate nature-scented fellow, very welcome<ptr target="loc.07530_n2"/>—he left yesterday en route to visit Johnson<ptr target="uva.00388_n1"/> (Century staff) at Sea Girt, on
                the N J sea coast—J B lodged at Tom Harned's,<ptr target="loc.03745_n1"/> &amp; T H and Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> liked him
                muchly—J B is not so hardy &amp; brown &amp; stout as formerly—that bad
                fiend insomnia haunts him as of old—he thinks himself it affects his literary
                power, (style, even matter)—Horace told him my half-suspicion that his
                association with the superciliousness &amp; sort o' vitriolic veneering of the New
                York literati had eat into him, but he denied &amp; pooh-pooh'd it—attributed
                it to his bad health, insomnia &amp;c—said he knew himself he could not (or 
                did not) write with the vim of his better days—(probably makes more acc't of
                that by far, than really <hi rend="italic">is</hi>)—</p>

            <p>I expect to get a specimen copy of <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi><ptr target="n3999"/> from the
                binder this evening—Shall not feel out of the woods &amp; all safe, until I
                see the October <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, with my Army Hospital piece
                printed—accepted &amp; paid for by them two years ago—as I consider
                myself obligated not to print from it until it has been <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                published by them—(But I have heard they give it—intend to—in the
                Oct. number)—</p>

            <p><date when="1888-09-22"><hi rend="italic">Afternoon</hi></date>—Horace comes with spec[imen] of <hi rend="italic">Nov: B</hi> bound for sample—it is satisfactory—looks
                plain, larger than expected—I give an order or two changing the lettering on
                cover, &amp;c.—the picture printing gives satisfaction—In fact <hi rend="italic">all will do</hi>—("Only think" said the Irish girl "what
                ye'd said if it was ever so worser")—I have been expecting Alma Johnston<ptr target="n3330"/> of N
                Y to-day (or yesterday)—but no sign—a dear &amp; prized
                friend—"good roots" for the meter<ptr target="loc.07530_n3"/> (slang from N Y
                vagabonds, for favorable prophecy)—It gets cooler &amp; I have donn'd my big
                blue wool overgown—as I end with love &amp; thanks to you—</p>
