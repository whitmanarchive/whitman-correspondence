                fiend insomnia haunts him as of old&#8212;he thinks himself it affects his literary
                power, (style, even matter)&#8212;Horace told him my half-suspicion that his
                association with the superciliousness &#38; sort o' vitriolic veneering of the New
                York literati had eat into him, but he denied &#38; pooh-pooh'd it&#8212;attributed
                it to his bad health, insomnia &#38;c&#8212;said he knew himself he could not (or 
                did not) write with the vim of his better days&#8212;(probably makes more acc't of
