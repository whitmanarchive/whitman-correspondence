            <p>I have nothing of consequence to write, but I thought I would send you a few lines anyhow. I have just written Nelly a letter, &amp; send to Little Compton&#8212;We are full of politics here, the dispute runs high &amp; hot everywhere&#8212;I think the Republicans are going to make a stout fight after all, as there is confusion in the opposition camp&#8212;the result of course I do not pretend to foretell&#8212;</p>
            <p>My health is quite re-established, yet not exactly the same unconscious state of health as formerly&#8212;The book is still unprinted&#8212;Our family are all well as usual&#8212;I go two or three times a week among the soldiers in hospital here&#8212;</p>
            <p>I go out quite regularly, sometimes out on the bay, or to Coney Island&#8212;&amp; occasionally a tour through New York life, as of old&#8212;last night I was with some of my friends of Fred Gray association,<ptr target="nyp.00193_n2"/> till late wandering the east side of the City&#8212;first in the lager bier saloons &amp; then elsewhere&#8212;one crowded, low, most degraded place we went, a poor blear-eyed girl bringing beer. I saw her with a McClellan medal on her breast&#8212;I called her &amp; asked her if the other girls there were for McClellan<ptr target="nyp.00193_n3"/> too&#8212;she said yes every one of them, &amp; that they wouldn't tolerate a girl in the place who was not, &amp; the fellows were too&#8212;(there must have been twenty girls, sad sad ruins)&#8212;it was one of those places where the air is full of the scent of low thievery, druggies, foul play, &amp; prostitution gangrened&#8212;</p>
            <p>I don't know what move I shall make, but something soon, as it is not satisfactory any more in New York &amp; Brooklyn&#8212;I should think nine tenths, of all classes, are copperheads here, I never heard before such things as I hear now whenever I go out&#8212;then it seems tame &amp; indeed unreal here, life as carried on &amp; as I come in contact with it &amp; receive its influences&#8212;</p>
            <p>How is Ashton? &amp; is he there again?<ptr target="nyp.00193_n4"/> I got a letter from Charley Eldridge yesterday&#8212;I suppose he is now in Boston&#8212;My dear friend, I often often think of you, &amp; count on our being together again, may be quite soon&#8212;meantime good bye &amp; God bless you &amp; I send you my best best love&#8212;</p>
