                <p>If things go on as they have for the past week, you will have to think yourself lucky
                    if you get even a postal in ten days. You must remember that I am housekeeper,
                    nurse, marketer, &#38; have to see that the house is decent, if

                    possible, besides being interrupted at every 
                    ten minutes to answer some one who calls from a good motive to ask how Wm. is, but would do better not to come often.</p>
                
                <p>So far I am the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> nurse, &#38; if you have been as
                    badly

                    off as he is, you may have some idea of what it means, in this case it means that I
                    wash &#38; dress him so far as he can be dressed,&#8212;wash his urinals, for he has
                    to be protected night &#38; day, from the constant dripping,&#8212;&#38; to keep

                   him at all clean is nearly impossible. Some nights I get not more than four hours
                    sleep &#38; that very broken, &#38; some days not one moment to rest at all. To-day
                    I am nearly blind from loss of sleep. We have some very bad nights since the

               attack four weeks ago, &#38; one of the very bad and troublesome developments is the nausea 
                    and throwing up, so you see that I am not very idle, &#38; I some days could not write a postal 
                    card to save you.  You will ask <hi rend="underline">why</hi> we don't have a nurse &#38; the
