            </opener>

            <p>Glad am I when the time comes round for writing to you again&#8212;though I can't
                please myself with my letters, poor little echoes that they are of the loving,
                hoping, far journeying thoughts so busy within. It has been a happy time since I <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02874.002.jpg" type="verso"/> received the paper
                with the joyful news you were back at Washington, well on your way to recovery able
                partially to resume work&#8212;scenting from afar the fresh breeze &amp; sunshine of
                perfect health&#8212;by this time, not from afar, perhaps. The thought of that makes
                dull days bright <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&amp;
                    bright</supplied> days glorious to me too.&#8212;I noted in the New York Graphic
                that a new edition of "Leaves of Grass" was called for <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02874.003.jpg" type="recto"/> &#8212;sign truly that America is not so
                very slowly now absorbing the precious food she needs above all else? Perhaps dear
                Friend, even during your lifetime will begin to come the "proof you will alone
                accept,&#8212;that your country absorb you as affectionately as you have absorbed
                it." I have had two great pleasures since I last wrote you. One is that Herby<!-- <ptr target="loc.02874_n1"/> --> has read with a large measure of <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02874.004.jpg" type="verso"/> responsive delight
                Leaves of Grass quite through, so that he now sees you with his own eyes &amp; has
                in his heart the living growing germs of a loving <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">admiration that will grow with his
                    growth</supplied> &amp; strengthen every fibre of good in him&#8212;Also he read
                &amp; took much pride in my "Letters" now shown him for the first time. Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02874_n2"/> --> has had a fortnight's holiday with us,
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">and looks
                    better</supplied>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02874.005.jpg" type="recto"/> in health though still
                not altogether as I could wish. He says he is getting such good experience, he would
                not care just yet to change his post even for better pay. Music is his greatest
                pleasure&#8212;he seems to get more enjoyment out of that than out of literature,
                &amp; is acquiring some practical skill. </p>

            <p>To–day (Feb. 25th) is my birthday, dearest Friend&#8212;a day my children
                always <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02874.006.jpg" type="verso"/> make very
                bright &amp; happy to me: and on it they make me promise to "do nothing but what I
                like all day." So I shall spend it with you,&#8212;partly in finishing this letter,
                partly reading in the book that is so dear to me&#8212;for that is indeed my soul
                coming into the presence of your soul&#8212; filled by it with strength &amp; warmth
                &amp; joy.&#8212;In discouraged moods, when oppressed with the consciousness of my
                own limitations, <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02874.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
                failures, lack of many beautiful gifts, I say to myself "What sort of a bird with
                unfledged wings are you that would mate with an eagle? Can your eyes look the sun in
                the face like his? Can you sustain year long, lifelong flights upward? Can you
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#al">nest</unclear><!-- Harned used "rest". --> in dizzy rocks overhanging dark,
                tempestuous abysses? Is your heart like his, a great glowing sun of Love?" Then I
                answer "Give me <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02874.008.jpg" type="verso"/> Time.
                I can bide my time,&#8212;a long long growing &amp; unfolding time. That he draws me
                with such power, that my soul has found the meaning of itself in him&#8212;the
                object of all its deep, deathless aspirations in comradeship with him, means, if
                life <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">is not a mockery
                    clean</supplied> ended by death, that the germs are in me, that through cleaving
                &amp; loving &amp; ever striving up &amp; on I shall grow like him&#8212;like but
                different&#8212;the correlative&#8212; What his soul needs &amp; desires; <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02874.009.jpg" type="recto"/> And if when I reach
                America he is not so drawn towards me,&#8212;if seeing how often I disappoint
                myself, needs must that he too is disappointed, still I can hold bravely, lovingly
                on to this inextinguishable faith &amp; hope&#8212;with the added joy of his
                presence sometimes winning from him more &amp; more a dear friendship yielding him
                some joy <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02874.010.jpg" type="verso"/> &amp;
                comfort&#8212;for he too turns with hope, with yearning, towards me&#8212;bids me be
                "satisfied &amp; at peace" So I am, so I will be my Darling. Surely surely, sooner
                or later I shall justify that hope satisfy that yearning. This is what I say to
                myself &amp; to you this 46th birthday Have I said it over <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&amp; over</supplied> again?
                That <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.02874.011.jpg" type="recto"/> is because it is
                the under current of my whole life.&#8212;The "Tribune" with Proctor's "Lecture on
                the Sun"<!-- <ptr target="loc.02874_n3"/> --> (&amp; a great deal besides that interests me)
                came safe. A masterly lecture. And two days ago came the Philadelphia paper with
                Prof. Morton's speech&#8212;deeply interesting. And as I read these things, the
                feeling that they have come from, &amp; been read by, you turns them <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc.02874.012.jpg" type="verso"/> into Poems for me. </p>
