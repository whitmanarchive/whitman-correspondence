        <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your welcome letter reached me to-day. Yours from Washington of over two weeks since, 
        also came safe. Since my letter of about three weeks since to Charles Eldridge&#8212;in which I wrote to you also<ptr target="nyp.00320_n1"/>&#8212;I have not improved any&#8212;the distress in my head 
        has not abated&#8212;some spells are very bad indeed&#8212;(but it fluctuates, some days, 
        or parts of days, leaving me comparatively comfortable.) Nor can I walk any better&#8212;some of the time, not so well&#8212;My saving points are pretty good nights' rest, 
        and a fair appetite, digestion, &amp;c. Still I can see I am gradually being pulled, 
        and, though I have not at all given up hope of eventual recovery, I do not shut 
        my eyes to the other termination&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I am very comfortable here, as I believe I told you, occupying mother's former rooms, 
        (a north &amp; south one, second floor,) and with all her nice &amp; homely furniture 
        &amp; bed &amp; chairs&#8212;&amp; living day &amp; night in her memory &amp; atmosphere.
      </p>
      
      <p>We are having the hottest sort of weather here&#8212;in New York and Washington it must be terrible&#8212;but here I find I stand it quite well. I rec'd a note from John Burroughs telling me 
        of his flitting visit to Newport &amp; call on you. I have been waiting till I felt stronger, 
        to go to Atlantic City (Jersey sea shore) or Long Island, but in my present condition 
        feel it best to stay here&#8212;(Nelly, I don't feel as well as when you 
        used to come there to White's)<ptr target="nyp.00320_n2"/>&#8212;I shall be glad indeed to have Charles Eldridge come here &amp; see me&#8212;&amp; it will be a <hi rend="italic">real disappointment</hi> if he does not&#8212;but I count on his coming 
        <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>&#8212;I hope to get a letter from him soon.
      </p>
      
      <p>I still manage to get out a little, towards evening&#8212;not always, but nearly every day&#8212;get to the ferry boat, &amp; sail to &amp; fro across the Delaware, occasionally&#8212;I had seen in the newspapers of William's appointment, &amp; was truly pleased&#8212;I hear from Peter Doyle quite regularly&#8212;he is well, &amp; working at his dangerous post 
        on the Baltimore &amp; Potomac RR&#8212;I miss him much&#8212;&amp; I miss you too, Nelly&#8212;I am very lonesome here, (&amp; yet I keep up very good heart)&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>If Charles Eldridge is there, I send him my love, &amp; the same to all&#8212;to your daughter Jeannie, (whom you do not mention) &amp; to your sister 
        &amp; the Doctor,<ptr target="nyp.00320_n3"/> &amp; all who in good will enquire for me&#8212;It is now between 3 and 4 Saturday afternoon&#8212;I am sitting here in mother's great arm chair&#8212;we have had a hot day&#8212;but a breeze is springing up&#8212;it is a shady quiet spot here&#8212;I shall try to hobble out soon though I am quite feeble.
