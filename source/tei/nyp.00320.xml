        <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your welcome letter reached me to-day. Yours from Washington of over two weeks since, 
        also came safe. Since my letter of about three weeks since to Charles Eldridge—in which I wrote to you also<ptr target="nyp.00320_n1"/>—I have not improved any—the distress in my head 
        has not abated—some spells are very bad indeed—(but it fluctuates, some days, 
        or parts of days, leaving me comparatively comfortable.) Nor can I walk any better—some of the time, not so well—My saving points are pretty good nights' rest, 
        and a fair appetite, digestion, &amp;c. Still I can see I am gradually being pulled, 
        and, though I have not at all given up hope of eventual recovery, I do not shut 
        my eyes to the other termination—</p>
      
      <p>I am very comfortable here, as I believe I told you, occupying mother's former rooms, 
        (a north &amp; south one, second floor,) and with all her nice &amp; homely furniture 
        &amp; bed &amp; chairs—&amp; living day &amp; night in her memory &amp; atmosphere.
      </p>
      
      <p>We are having the hottest sort of weather here—in New York and Washington it must be terrible—but here I find I stand it quite well. I rec'd a note from John Burroughs telling me 
        of his flitting visit to Newport &amp; call on you. I have been waiting till I felt stronger, 
        to go to Atlantic City (Jersey sea shore) or Long Island, but in my present condition 
        feel it best to stay here—(Nelly, I don't feel as well as when you 
        used to come there to White's)<ptr target="nyp.00320_n2"/>—I shall be glad indeed to have Charles Eldridge come here &amp; see me—&amp; it will be a <hi rend="italic">real disappointment</hi> if he does not—but I count on his coming 
        <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>—I hope to get a letter from him soon.
      </p>
      
      <p>I still manage to get out a little, towards evening—not always, but nearly every day—get to the ferry boat, &amp; sail to &amp; fro across the Delaware, occasionally—I had seen in the newspapers of William's appointment, &amp; was truly pleased—I hear from Peter Doyle quite regularly—he is well, &amp; working at his dangerous post 
        on the Baltimore &amp; Potomac RR—I miss him much—&amp; I miss you too, Nelly—I am very lonesome here, (&amp; yet I keep up very good heart)—</p>
      
      <p>If Charles Eldridge is there, I send him my love, &amp; the same to all—to your daughter Jeannie, (whom you do not mention) &amp; to your sister 
        &amp; the Doctor,<ptr target="nyp.00320_n3"/> &amp; all who in good will enquire for me—It is now between 3 and 4 Saturday afternoon—I am sitting here in mother's great arm chair—we have had a hot day—but a breeze is springing up—it is a shady quiet spot here—I shall try to hobble out soon though I am quite feeble.
      </p>
