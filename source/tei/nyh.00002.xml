            <p>Dear friends, I thought it would be soothing to you to have a few lines about the last days of your son Erastus Haskell of Company K, 141st New York Volunteers. I write in haste, &amp; nothing of importance&#8212;only I thought any thing about Erastus would be welcome. From the time he came to Armory Square Hospital till he died, there was hardly a day but I was with him a portion of the time&#8212;if not during the day, then at night. I had no opportunity to do much, or any thing for him, as nothing was needed, only to wait the progress of his malady. I am only a friend, visiting the wounded &amp; sick soldiers, (not connected with any society&#8212;or State.) From the first I felt that Erastus was in danger, or at least was much worse than they in the hospital supposed. As he made no complaint, they perhaps [thought him]<ptr target="nyh.00002_n3"/> not very bad&#8212;I told the [doctor of the ward] to look him over again&#8212;he was a much [sicker boy?] than he supposed, but he took it lightly, said, I know more about these fever cases than you do&#8212;the young man looks very sick, but I shall certainly bring him out of it all right. I have no doubt the doctor meant well &amp; did his best&#8212;at any rate, about a week or so before Erastus died he got really alarmed &amp; after that he &amp; all the doctors tried to help him, but without avail&#8212;Maybe it would not have made any difference any how&#8212;I think Erastus was broken down, poor boy, before he came to the hospital here&#8212;I believe he came here about July 11th&#8212;Somehow I took to him, he was a quiet young man, behaved always correct &amp; decent, said little&#8212;I used to sit on the side of his bed&#8212;I said once, You don't talk any, Erastus, you leave me to do all the talking&#8212;he only answered quietly, I was never much of a talker. The doctor wished every one to cheer him up very lively&#8212;I was always pleasant &amp; cheerful with him, but did not feel to be very lively&#8212;Only once I tried to tell him some amusing narratives, but after a few moments I stopt, I saw that the effect was not good, &amp; after that I never tried it again&#8212;I used to sit by the side of his bed, pretty silent, as that seemed most agreeable to him, &amp; I felt it so too&#8212;he was generally opprest for breath, &amp; with the heat, &amp; I would fan him&#8212;occasionally he would want a drink&#8212;some days he dozed a good deal&#8212;sometimes when I would come in, he woke up, &amp; I would lean down &amp; kiss him, he would reach out his hand &amp; pat my hair &amp; beard a little, very friendly, as I sat on the bed &amp; leaned over him.</p>
            <p>Much of the time his breathing was hard, his throat worked&#8212;they tried to keep him up by giving him stimulants, milk-punch, wine &amp;c&#8212;these perhaps affected him, for often his mind wandered somewhat&#8212;I would say, Erastus, don't you remember me, dear son?&#8212;can't you call me by name?&#8212;once he looked at me quite a while when I asked him, &amp; he mentioned over in[audibly?] a name or two (one sounded like [Mr. Setchell]) &amp; then, as his eyes closed, he said quite slow, as if to himself, I don't remember, I dont remember, I dont remember&#8212;it was quite pitiful&#8212;one thing was he could not talk very comfortably at any time, his throat &amp; chest seemed stopped&#8212;I have no doubt at all he had some complaint besides the typhoid&#8212;In my limited talks with him, he told me about his brothers &amp; sisters by name, &amp; his parents, wished me to write to his parents &amp; send them &amp; all his love&#8212;I think he told me about his brothers living in different places, one in New York City, if I recollect right&#8212;From what he told me, he must have been poorly enough for several months before he came to Armory Sq[uare] Hosp[ital]&#8212;the first week in July I think he told me he was at the regimental hospital at a place called Baltimore Corners not many miles from White House, on the peninsula&#8212;previous to that, for quite a long time, although he kept around, he was not at all well&#8212;couldn't do much&#8212;was in the band as a fifer I believe&#8212;While he lay sick here he had his fife laying on the little stand by his side&#8212;he once told me that if he got well he would play me a tune on it<ptr target="nyh.00002_n4"/>&#8212;but, he says, I am not much of a player yet.</p>
            <p>I was very anxious he should be saved, &amp; so were they all&#8212;he was well used by the attendants&#8212;poor boy, I can see him as I write&#8212;he was tanned &amp; had a fine head of hair, &amp; looked good in the face when he first came, &amp; was in pretty good flesh too&#8212;(had his hair cut close about ten or twelve days before he died)&#8212;He never complained&#8212;but it looked pitiful to see him lying there, with such a look out of his eyes. He had large clear eyes, they seemed to talk better than words&#8212;I assure you I was attracted to him much&#8212;Many nights I sat in the hospital by his bedside till far in the night&#8212;The lights would be put out&#8212;yet I would sit there silently, hours, late, perhaps fanning him&#8212;he always liked to have me sit there, but never cared to talk&#8212;I shall never forget those nights, it was a curious &amp; solemn scene, the sick &amp; wounded lying around in their cots, just visible in the darkness, &amp; this dear young man close at hand lying on what proved to be his death bed&#8212;I do not know his past life, but what I do know, &amp; what I saw of him, he was a noble boy&#8212;I felt he was one I should get very much attached to. I think you have reason to be proud of such a son, &amp; all his relatives have cause to treasure his memory.</p>
            <p>I write to you this letter, because I would do something at least in his memory&#8212;his fate was a hard one, to die so&#8212;He is one of the thousands of our unknown American young men in the ranks about whom there is no record or fame, no fuss made about their dying so unknown, but I find in them the real precious &amp; royal ones of this land, giving themselves up, aye even their young &amp; precious lives, in their country's cause&#8212;Poor dear son, though you were not my son, I felt to love you as a son, what short time I saw you sick &amp; dying here&#8212;it is as well as it is, perhaps better&#8212;for who knows whether he is not better off, that patient &amp; sweet young soul, to go, than we are to stay? So farewell, dear boy&#8212;it was my opportunity to be with you in your last rapid days of death&#8212;no chance as I have said to do any thing particular, for nothing [could be done&#8212;only you did not lay] here &amp; die among strangers without having one at hand who loved you dearly, &amp; to whom you gave your dying kiss&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mr and Mrs Haskell, I have thus written rapidly whatever came up about Erastus,<ptr target="nyh.00002_n5"/> &amp; must now close. Though we are strangers &amp; shall probably never see each other, I send you &amp; all Erastus' brothers &amp; sisters my love&#8212;</p>
