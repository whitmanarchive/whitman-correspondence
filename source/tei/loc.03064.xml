            <p>I have your postal card of yesterday. I send you a <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> of Sunday, as I see by your card that up to 
            afternoon, you had not seen it. On the 5th page is my touch at Comstock. I hope it will do you good.</p>
            <p>The editor printed it just as I wrote it except the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03064.002_large.jpg" type="verso"
                /> opening sentence, which read: "Mr. Anthony Comstock's hostility to the nude&#8212;of which an illustrious instance was his 
                famous prosecution of three unfortunate women, whom he had hired to dance before him for over an hour, without clothing, in a 
                New York brothel&#8212;appears to extend to even the naked truth." The mild
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03064.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> editor has spared <hi rend="underline">Teufelsdr&#246;ckh</hi> the bloody stripe this sarcasm would have 
            left upon him, by excising the sentence. But he gets enough. The vagabond.</p>
            <p>Now for Tobey! I wish I were not so driven with work, and felt well. I have been much played out this summer, especially
            the last month.</p>
            <p>Glad to hear your prose book is so well advanced<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03064.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> and that the third edition of the "Leaves" is flying out. Rees Welsh &amp; Co
            must take care not to get left, but have the books on hand, for I think by September we shall have a boom in full drive. I will do
            my best to keep up the controversy.</p>
            <p>Tucker has fairly cowed Stevens &amp; Co in Boston. My private advices are very amusing. Pity Osgood was such a craven, though better for you.</p>
