            <p>I have your card of 17<hi rend="underline">th</hi> Have also had a letter from Mrs O'Connor<ptr target="n4137"/> telling me 
                about O'C<hi rend="underline">s</hi><ptr target="n2002"/> Exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O C.  It seems 
                O'C.<hi rend="underline">s</hi> doctors are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is <hi rend="underline">now</hi> 
                Scleroris the disease has been Sclerosis <hi rend="underline">all along</hi> and how 
                the doctors could have thought otherwise (if they <hi rend="underline">did</hi> so think) 
                I cannot imagine.  It is pitiable to see the hon 
                fellow at this late hour going for "change of air" as if that could by any possibility do 
                any good in such a case.  However it won't do any harm and the change may nurse him up a little 
                for the time.  He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the 
                best thing of course is to save 
                him all the suf<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_as.00187_large.jpg" type="verso"/>fering 
                (mental &amp; bodily) possible.  All quiet here&#8212;country all frozen solid again&#8212;
                spenldid wheeling smooth hard roads&#8212;cloudy weather&#8212;all well here we have just 
                had a good dinner&#8212; roast turkey, bread sauce &#38; apple pie &#8212; what more could
                we ask for?  We are all looking forward to seeing you here by &#38; by&#8212;if the lecture
                comes off Mrs B.<ptr target="n4273"/> will go with me to New York after you and surely we can bring you home 
                comfortably between us&#8212;I have just written to Johnston<ptr target="n5001"/> too about the lecture want 
                to find out what they are thinking about in New York I guess it will be all right&#8212;they
                surely will not let the chance go by after Phil<hi rend="underline">a</hi> setting them such a good example last year&#8212;I 
                wonder when they are going to print your hospital article in the Century?</p>
