            <p>Came through here all right—seems to be much as I was mentioning to you the other day—at any rate I feel better here now at the end than I did the two days before I started, &amp; on Wednesday night &amp; morning—Found it comfortable &amp; easy on the sleeping car—suited me perfectly—I see now that <hi rend="italic">you ought to have come</hi>—you would have enjoyed every thing—it is really nothing difficult to come—To make it more interesting we had a smash about 5½ Thursday p m on our train, just escaped being something very bad indeed—the two locomotives all shivered to splinters—nobody hurt however, (only one man who jumped, the mail agent)—detained us there 2½ hours<ptr target="mhs.00025_n2"/>—I didn't mind it at all—the last 400 miles since we did fly!—I never rode so fast before in my life—strangely enough too I slept quite well—only woke up every hour or two—When we got here in St L an hour &amp; a half ago, on alighting from the cars
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="mhs.00025.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>    
                found Jeff waiting for me—he looks fat &amp; dark, &amp; like work—(which I guess he has plenty of)—We all rode immediately to the Planter's Hotel, where we were expected, &amp; have just had a royal breakfast, perfect beefsteak, broiled chicken, oysters, good coffee &amp;c—enjoyed it, for I hadn't eat any thing since yesterday at 3½—This great hotel is crowded with guests—the proprietor puts his private parlor &amp; room at my disposal, &amp; it is in it I am writing this—Jeff is coming in about an hour to take us on a long ride around—I shall stay with him &amp; the girls to-night—To morrow morning at 8.50 we start for central Kansas, 350 miles further (we are here 1000 miles from Phila:)—</p>
            
            <p>Lou, I will write again, what moves I make—dont exactly know—most likely I shall come back with Col. F soon, as I find it mighty convenient &amp; nice—every thing seen to—</p>

            <p>Saturday—8 a m—I have been stopping at Jeffs—they are very nicely fixed—slept like a top—have just had a first rate breakfast—the girls are well, &amp; send love—they much wish you had come—</p>
            
            <p>—I now start in an hour for Kansas, (Lawrence) shall get there about 10 to-night</p>
