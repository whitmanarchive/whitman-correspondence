            <p>I must write you a few lines dear loving friend once
                more at any rate. Since I last wrote clouds have darkened over me, &#38; still
                remain. On the night of 23d of January last I was paralyzed,<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> 
                left side, &#38; have remained so since. February 19th I lost a dear sister,<ptr target="n0707"/>
                who died in St. Louis, leaving two young daughters.<ptr target="upa.00174_n3"/> May 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 
                my inexpressibly beloved mother<ptr target="n0705"/> died in Camden. 
                I was just able to get from Washington to her dying bed, &#38; sit there. 
                I thought I was bearing all stoutly but I find it affecting
                the progress of my recovery since, &#38; now. The doctor says my disease is really
                cerebral anaemia, resulting in paralysis. I am still feeble, palsied, &#38; have
                spells of great distress in the head&#8212;But there are favorable points&#8212;I
                am up &#38; dressed every day, sleep &#38; eat middling well, &#38; do not change
                much yet in flesh &#38; face, only look very old, (though that is nothing new.)
                Though I move slowly very short distances, I walk with difficulty, &#38; have to
                remain in or near the house. I think the probabilities are quite strong 
                <hi rend="underline">yet that I shall get well, (though I may not.) </hi></p>
            <p>Many times during the past year, especially during the past 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="upa.00015.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                six months, have I thought of you
                &#38; your children&#8212;Many times indeed have I been going to write, but did not.
                I have just been reading over again several of this &#38; last year's letters from
                you, &#38; looking at the pictures<ptr target="upa.00015_n6"/> sent in the one of January 24, '72. The letters
                of Jan 24, June 3, &#38; July 11, of '72,<ptr target="upa.00015_n5"/> &#38; of Jan
                31 &#38; May 20, this year<ptr target="upa.00015_n2"/>&#8212;with certainly one
                other, &#38; may-be two&#8212;all came safe. Do not think hard of me for not
                writing oftener, especially the last seven months&#8212;If you could look into my
                spirit &#38; emotions you would be entirely satisfied &#38; at peace. </p>
            <p>I am at present temporarily here at Camden, on the Delaware river, immediately
                opposite Philadelphia, at the house of my brother.<ptr target="n0700b"/> I am occupying the rooms where my
                mother died&#8212;every object of furniture &#38;c. is familiar &#38; has an
                emotional history. You must not be unhappy about me, for I am as comfortably
                situated as can be&#8212;And many things&#8212;indeed every thing,&#8212;in my case
                might be so much worse. Though my plans depend on yet uncertain results, my
                intention, as far as any thing, is, on getting stronger, &#38; after the hot season
                passes, to get back to Washington for the fall &#38; winter. My post office address
                continues there, (Solicitor's Office Treasury.) I send my love to Percy,<ptr target="n2000"/> &#38; all
                your dear children. The enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger &#38; send
                you with my love.<ptr target="upa.00015_n3"/></p>
