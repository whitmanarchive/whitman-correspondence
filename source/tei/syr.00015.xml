                    <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I copy the foregoing from page 709, in the May number of the Contemporary Review in an article: 
                    "The Interpretation of <choice><sic>Litterature</sic><corr>Literature</corr></choice>" by 
                    Professor Dowden,<ptr target="n0199"/> thinking you may not have seen it, and it may give you 
                    pleasure to see it. At Venice, a year ago, I met Mr. Symmonds,<ptr target="n0615"/> an English 
                    author of eminence, who greatly admired your writings and was eager to hear of you. Whenever I 
                    hear your works mentioned it is with a frank and outspoken admiration formerly more rare. And 
                    though you 
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr_kc.00044_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                    must hear this now from all sides, still there may be moments when a friendly reiteration of it 
                    coming unexpectedly may not be uncheering to you. I think your works are doing good in the world. 
                    The revelation which is in the life all around us and in <choice><sic>ourselfs</sic><corr>ourselves</corr></choice> 
                    is more listened to, more respected. What is true, then, is more respected; what is natural is 
                    more respected; less violence is done to nature, or at any rate urged and insisted on as what ought 
                    to be done. Happiness is increased, increasing, &amp; is to be probably immeasurably more increased. 
                    To have had a share, and so large a share, in this work must be a great happiness &amp; cause of 
                    thankfulness for you. Excuse so long a letter. I meant it to be shorter. It calls for no answer. I 
                    hope all goes well with you. That you 
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00042_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                    are in fair health and fair spirits, without pains of body or spirit, or cares or anxieties. I 
                    remember you always with gratitude &amp; affection&#8212;both for your books and yourself.</p>

                <p>"We can point to no writer who drew early to his side a small band of eminent disciples and at the 
                    same time suffered shame and scoffing or total neglect from the crowd, who did not in the end prove 
                    a power in literature and gradually win acceptance from the world. Such was Wordsworth's<ptr target="n3046"/> 
                    position in the opening years of this century; such a little later was Shelley's<ptr target="med.00858_n13"/> 
                    position. Such was Carlyle's<ptr target="n1065"/> half a century since, and Mr. Browning's<ptr target="n0116"/> 
                    at a date more recent. Such also was Mr. Whitman's position until of late, when a considerable<ptr target="syr.00015_n2"/> 
                    <!--this part is on leav001r at the top of the page--> company has gathered to his side and the 
                    voice of opposition has almost fallen silent."</p>
