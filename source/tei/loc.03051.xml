                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:—</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>Your beautiful gift<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> rec'd.<ptr target="loc.03051_n1"/> I gloated and gloated over it.
                Such a precious memento! How we ought to love each other, &amp; draw closer &amp;
                closer in manly friendship—all of us who think &amp; believe the same things
                of the universe &amp; man. There is a mystery back of the visible, I am confident
                All matter seems to me instinct w. latent consciousness. Those Platonic remembrances
                the dim pre-natal consciousness carried over thro' the seminal germ of
                foetus—very remarkable psychological fact—only showing the <hi rend="underline">delicate</hi> character of matter.</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for the valuable &amp; remarkably vigorous little <hi rend="underline">Ilias-in-nuce</hi> sketch of Whittier.<ptr target="loc.03051_n2"/> It is worth all of my book put together. You make me
                jealous—you man of great power—you <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#smb">smite</unclear> home with such resistless power, &amp;
                graphic-picturesque words. I am going to quote what you say of Whittier. It's all
                right just what you w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> say in print.<ptr target="loc.03051_n3"/></p>
            <p>I am having a grand visit from a cousin. A real Western woman.<ptr target="n5001"/>—A Woodruff (you
                may have known one kinsman (cousin) Judge Lewis B. Woodruff<ptr target="loc.03051_n6"/> of New York
                Circuit-Court, highly revered man for his probity &amp; his legal decisions). This
                Hattie<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03051.002.jpg" type="verso"/> 
            Woodruff McDowell, fr' the Western Reserve is one of those marvellous, energetic
                Western girls—wrapped in their purity as armor, who go out &amp; locate land,
                farm their own living, &amp; travel alone around the continent,—&amp; lose no
                feminine charm. The world can't beat it!</p>
            <p>She brought in her trunk some calamus root which she boiled in maple sugar up in
                Vermont on a sugar ranche of her mother-in-law. I send you a little snip dear dad.
                Prost! I also send you per express paid a couple of jars of my nice currant jam put
                up by myself fr fruit raised by me here.</p>
            <p>Sorry indeed to hear of increase of that little deafness, &amp; of yr eyes. Keep a
                grand heart</p>
            <p>Hattie brings me a long letter of Jesse R. Grant,<ptr target="loc.03051_n7"/> the General's father, addressed to
                my great uncle Granger, (Judge William G. of Ohio<ptr target="loc.03051_n5"/> very wealthy now deceased). Jesse
                came very near marrying my uncle's sister he says. I may publish the letter. <hi rend="underline">So keep mum</hi>. Curious to think what wd hv. been the fate of
                the U.S. if he <hi rend="underline">had</hi> married Eliza G.!<ptr target="n5001"/></p>
