                <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>A few weeks ago I sent you a book of mine&#8212;Moses: a drama. It is an effort to
                represent the character of one who being far beyond his time has conceived a new
                idea, a new development for mankind, and by the very force with which he has
                conceived it wills to shape out, and shapes out, the way of its
                realisation&#8212;standing himself all the while alone, solitary, upon earth.<space dim="horizontal" extent="5 letters"/>I hope it may be some pleasure to you to
                read it, if only that I may pay part of the debt I owe you for your writings.</p>

            <p>I write this, having just had put into my hands a letter from Moncure Conway<!-- <ptr target="n0170"/> --> written
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01230.002.jpg" type="verso"/> after a visit to
                you at Camden. Is it true that no American publisher will issue your works? While
                reading your writings I have thought the future for which you looked quite close,
                but then one goes out into the world and hears such things as this and sees the
                general drift of men's minds towards commonplaceness &amp; conventional estimates of
                things, and then the future looks far&#8212;beyond all attainment as indeed I
                believe in some sense it is&#8212;and it seems only cruel that men (some) should be
                born to breathe their lives out after a mere visionary beauty. Will it ever be that
                human love&#8212;strong to meet with adventurous joy all chance &amp;
                change&#8212;will cease to be a <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#js">mere</unclear><!-- Kevin saw "men." "Mere" makes more syntactical sense. -JS -->
                name? that men will 'understand',&#8212;eat of the tree of knowledge of good &amp;
                evil, and so be immortal?.. How strange <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01230.003.jpg" type="recto"/> it is! I know that it must be, I see it
                everywhere&#8212;in face after face in the streets, in the sound of men's voices and
                in their silence&#8212;clear, unmistakeable, as if just about to be disclosed, the
                divine everywhere–equal life; and yet the children die, hardly knowing what
                they have sought yet knowing that they have not found it, and their dreams fade
                away, and to long suffering succeeds rest, and still the distance remains
                    immeasurable.<space dim="horizontal" extent="7 letters"/>All is resumed. As soon
                as I remember <hi rend="underline">what</hi> the end is&#8212;however great the
                distance&#8212;I do not doubt. It is quite <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">sure</unclear>&#8212;even as it is truly present with us now
                underlying all thought, &amp; these words. Dear friend, you <hi rend="underline">have</hi> so infused yourself that it is daily more &amp; more possible for men
                to walk hand <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01230.004.jpg" type="verso"/> in hand
                over the whole earth. As you have given your life, so others will after
                you&#8212;freely, with amplest reward transcending all suffering&#8212;for the end
                that you have dreamed. In the midst of the ferment of this age of material &amp;
                mechanical intercommunion you have planted the seed of a spiritual union &amp;
                identity above all space &amp; time, <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> yet shall use the spaces &amp; times of this earth (while it endures) for
                its manifestation and expression.<space dim="horizontal" extent="4 letters"/>What
                have we dreamed? a union which even now binds us closer than all thought&#8212;high
                up above all individual gain &amp; loss,&#8212;an individual self which stands out
                firm &amp; distinct, most solid of all facts, commensurate with all
                existence,&#8212; love disclosing each ever more &amp; more.<space dim="horizontal" extent="6 letters"/>See, you have made the earth sacred for me.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01230.005.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>Meanwhile they say that your writings are 'immoral' : and you have to defend yourself
                against people who will misunderstand your defence as they misunderstood your
                original words. Need I say that I do not agree with them in the least?. I believe on
                the contrary that you have been the first to enunciate the law of purity &amp;
                health which sooner or later must assert itself. After ages perhaps man will return
                    <hi rend="underline">consciously</hi> to the innocent joyous delight in his own
                natural powers &amp; instincts which characterised the early civilizations. I do not
                understand what it is to be 'shocked' by these things : it seems to me childish. But
                in the meantime it is certain that people do not understand. In some way or other
                our modern <choice>
                    <abbr>civ<hi rend="underline">n</hi></abbr>
                    <expan>civilization</expan>
                </choice> has become narrowed <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01230.006.jpg" type="verso"/> &amp; onesided. People's minds are dwarfed : one portion of their
                nature grows up in the dark (&amp; ceases to be healthy). Men have lost the freedom
                (free masonry) of Nature, and are plagued with insane doubts of their duty. For a
                time I suppose men must grow up in swaddling bands of morality, and a certain
                instinct makes them cling to them till they have grown to be greater than, &amp;
                masters of, morality. But I think indeed the time has come for people to learn to
                unwrap these bands, and that from this time there will be a world–wide growth
                in the direction you have pointed out.</p>

            <p>So while I regret sometimes that there are things in your writings which make it
                difficult, sometimes impossible, to <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01230.007.jpg" type="recto"/> commend them to some who might otherwise profit by them, yet I
                feel it is best that they <choice>
                    <orig>sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi></orig>
                    <reg>should</reg>
                </choice> be there. Their presence delays the understanding &amp; acceptation of
                your message, but your message would not be complete without it, and slowly,
                gradually, increasingly without end, its grandeur will dawn upon men.</p>

            <p>You are saying something on this subject in your Two Rivulets which I look forward to
                seeing. Can I obtain a copy through you, or have you an agent in London?</p>

            <p>I feel that my work is to carry on what you have begun. You have opened the way : my
                only desire is to go onward in it. If it is out of all question to suppose that one
                generation <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01230.008.jpg" type="verso"/> or ten
                generations will make <hi rend="underline">much</hi> difference in men's minds in
                the direction of the ideal state, still to contemplate that ideal &amp; to live
                slowly translating it into real life &amp; action is quite certainly the only
                good&#8212;and is sufficient. I do not think of anything that I have done except as
                preparation ; on all hands the words seem to me to be flowing in but exactly in what
                shape they will issue forth again I am not quite clear, and I think it is my
                business to wait yet.<space dim="horizontal" extent="4 letters"/>Meanwhile there is
                a wonderful new life springing up here in England. I have been this &amp; last
                winter at Leeds doing something in the way of lecturing &amp; teaching, and have
                seen a certain amount of the working <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/>
                &amp;c. There is <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.01230.009.jpg" type="recto"/>
                undoubtedly an entirely new (social) state of affairs coming about through their
                rise, and I hail it with delight, for the wealthier classes though they struggle for
                light are hopelessly bound in conventionality, and the rough experience of their
                contact with the rude <choice>
                    <sic>unaccomodating</sic>
                    <corr>unaccommodating</corr>
                </choice> life below them (during the next few years) will be salvation to them. I
                am very anxious to see America, partly for my own sake&#8212;to breathe a less
                conventional atmosphere ; partly for the sake of <hi rend="underline">seeing</hi>
                the people &amp; appreciating the life that is growing up in them, for I find that
                no general account, or seeing this other man's eyes, helps me towards that, and I
                have no <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.01230.010.jpg" type="verso"/> friend whose
                opinion I am willing to be guided by in the matter.<space dim="horizontal" extent="7 letters"/>I should go probably this next April, if it were not for the
                Philadelphia Exhibition<!-- <ptr target="n0146"/> -->&#8212;which makes me hesitate. Partly
                because it will increase the expense considerably, and partly because on account of
                the turmoil one will perhaps not see so much either of people in general &amp; their
                ways or of individuals as at another time.<space dim="horizontal" extent="6 letters"/>If I thought that one occasion would give me a better chance of seeing you than
                another I should be guided by that, but on the other hand I fear to plague
                you&#8212;and I daresay you <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.01230.011.jpg" type="recto"/>
