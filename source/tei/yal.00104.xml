            <p>You have lived just the seventy years which are greatest in the world's history &#38;
                richest in benefit &#38; advancement to its peoples. These seventy years have done
                much more to widen the interval between man &#38; the other animals than was
                accomplished by any five centuries which preceded them.</p>

            <p>What great births you have witnessed! The steam press, the steamship, the steel ship,
                the railroad, the perfected cotton-gin, the telegraph, the telephone, the
                phonograph, the photograph, photo-gravure, the electrotype, the gaslight, the
                electric light, the sewing machine, &#38; the amazing, infinitely varied &#38;
                innumerable products of coal tar,<pb xml:id="leaf001v"

            <p>2</p>
            <p>those latest &#38; strangest marvels of a marvelous age. And you have seen even
                greater births than these; for you have seen the application of anaesthesia to
                surgery-practice, whereby the ancient dominion of pain, which began with the first
                created life, came to an end in this earth forever; you have seen the slave set
                free, you have seen monarchy banished from France, &#38; reduced in England to a
                machine which makes an imposing show of diligence &#38; attention to business, but
                isn't connected with the works. Yes, you have indeed seen much&#8212;but tarry yet a
                while, for the greatest is yet to come. Wait thirty years, &#38; <hi
                    rend="underline">then</hi> look out over the earth! You shall see marvels</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="yal.00104.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="yal.00104.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>3</p>
            <p>upon marvels added to these whose nativity you have witnessed; &#38; conspicuous
                above them you shall see their formidable <hi rend="underline">R</hi>esult&#8212;<hi
                    rend="underline">M</hi>an at almost his full stature at last!&#8212;&#38; still
                growing, visibly growing while you look. In that day, who that hath a throne, or a
                gilded privilege not attainable by his neighbor, let him procure him slippers &#38;
                get ready to dance, for there is going to be music. Abide, &#38; see these things!
                Thirty of us who honor &#38; love you, offer the opportunity. We have among us 600
                years, good &#38; sound, left in the bank of life. Take 30 of them&#8212;the richest
                birth-day gift ever offered to<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="yal.00104.006_large.jpg"

            <p>poet in this world&#8212;&#38; sit down &#38; wait. Wait till you see that great
                figure appear, &#38; catch the far glint of the sun upon his banner; then you may
                depart satisfied, as knowing you have seen him for whom the earth was made, &#38;
                that he will proclaim that human wheat is worth more than human tares, &#38; proceed
                to reorganize human values on that basis.</p>
