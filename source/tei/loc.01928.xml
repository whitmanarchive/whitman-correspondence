                <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your attention is respectfully called to the annexed specimen page of a volume to be entitled:</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">SLAVE SONGS OF THE UNITED STATES.</hi></p>
            <p>The collection will, probably, exceed one hundred in number, of which the music accompanies the words, besides some words without music, and some music without words. It is based primarily on the collections of Prof. Wm. F. Allen, Charles P. Ware and Miss Lucy McKim, but consists also of contributions from the best sources in all parts of the South. Among the States represented are South Carolina (very extensively), Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Arkansas, Missouri, and the Mississippi River. A preface by Prof. Allen, will give the most interesting facts connected with the songs, together with some account of the Sea Island dialect. The whole will be comprised in an octavo volume of about 150 pages, printed in the most handsome manner and substantially bound.</p>
            <p>A book of this description, unique, valuable for preserving, what, under the new <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> at the South, it is daily becoming more difficult to secure, and attractive to all lovers of music by reason of the beautiful melodies which it embalms<!-- Interesting word choice. -->, would seem to be entitled to a wide circulation, and as such is hereby recommended to you.</p>
            <p>The publishers, being desirous of ascertaining in advance how large an edition it will be necessary to print, take this mode of soliciting an order from you.</p>

                <p>The truly musical, the lovers of the curious, the students of language, the friends of the colored race in America, of course will have an interest in a work of this character; but it has also very high claims as a contribution to history, and as a record of religious feeling which would be remarkable in any age.</p>
