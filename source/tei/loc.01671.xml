            </opener>

            <p>I am getting over my late bad spell—I have been very sick indeed, the feeling
                of death &amp; dizziness, my head swimming a great deal of the time—turning
                like a wheel—with much distress in left side, keeps me awake some nights all
                night—the doctor says, however, these troubles, in his opinion, are from a
                very serious &amp; obstinate <hi rend="underline">liver affection</hi>—<hi rend="underline">not</hi> from head,
                lungs, heart,—he still thinks there is nothing but what I will get the better
                of—(&amp; we will trust he is a true prophet)—</p>
  
            <p>I wrote about like the foregoing to Mrs.
                O'Connor,<ptr target="loc.01671_n2"/> but <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01671.002.jpg" type="verso"/>was too sick to repeat it to
                you—&amp; that was one reason I asked you to go up there,—I <choice>

                            <reg>haven't</reg>
                        </choice> been out for three weeks, but ventured out yesterday for an hour, &amp;
                got along better than I expected—&amp; shall go out, or try to, to-day, as it
                is very pleasant—You must not be needlessly alarmed, my darling boy, for I
                still think I shall get, at any rate partially well &amp; strong enough—The
                doctor is quite encouraging—comes every day—&amp; I feel a good heart
                yet—My young fireman friend Alcott<ptr target="loc.01671_n3"/> (I
                think I mentioned his sickness,) is dead &amp; buried, poor fellow—I send you
                a bit of piece of mine about him from the paper—I have some spurts of visits,
                &amp; company—but very little that goes to the right spot, with me—my
                brother George has got a horse &amp; light wagon, &amp; takes me out now &amp;
                then—I enjoy it much—but I have been too feeble lately—altogether
                pretty lonesome here, but might be much worse—Love to Mrs. &amp; Mr. Nash,
                &amp; to all inquiring friends</p>
