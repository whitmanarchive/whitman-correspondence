                <p><handShift rend="printed"/><hi rend="bold">The Agathanian Club</hi> will shortly
                    begin the issue of original publications, and reprints of rare, curious and old
                    American, English, French and Latin books. The typography will be that of the
                    Bradstreet Press<!-- <ptr target="n0102"/> -->, and will equal, if not excel, the best
                    productions of the <hi rend="bold">Shakspere, Chiswick,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Didot</hi> Presses.</p>
                <p>The objects in view are:</p>
                <!--do the p tags suffice, or ought I create a list?-->
                <p>1. To enable persons possessed of bibliophilogical tastes to procure at a
                    moderate price, valuable works, produced in the highest style of art, with all
                    possible exactness of text, and of which only a very small number of copies will
                    be printed.</p>
                <p>2. To stimulate the development of the typographical art in this country to its
                    utmost limit of perfection.</p>
                <p>One hundred and twenty copies only of each work will be published; one hundred of
                    which will be for sale, and the remainder for private distribution. The <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01927.003.jpg" type="recto"/>paper used will be
                    of the same quality as that on which this announcement is printed; the size
                    medium octavo.</p>
                <p>When necessary, notes for the purpose of elucidating the text will be furnished,
                    in the form of an appendix, by accomplished scholars.</p>
                <p>In reprinting old books, the style of the original as regards type and general
                    appearance, will be preserved, so far as may be compatible with correctness and
                    true aesthetic principles. Head and tail pieces, initial letters, woodcuts and
                    other engravings, will invariably be reproduced in fac–simile.</p>
                <p>The first issue will be a reprint of an exceedingly rare and interesting book,
                    entitled, "Advice to the Officers of the British Army," the authorship of which
                    is generally attributed to Captain Grose<!-- <ptr target="n0280"/> -->, a distinguished
                    literary gentleman of the last century. As a clever piece of satire, this work
                    has probably never been equaled. The precepts it contains are fully as
                    applicable to armies of the present day as to the British army of nearly a
                    hundred years ago. A satirical woodcut, supposed to represent Sir Henry
                        Clinton<!-- <ptr target="n0164"/> -->, General Burgoyne, Lord Cornwallis<!-- <ptr target="n0173"/> --> and others, will be given in fac–simile of the
                    original. The notes and introduction to this work will be written by a
                    well–known author. It will be published on or about the fifteenth of
                    February. Subscribers will have preference in being supplied, according to the
                    order in which their subscriptions <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01927.004.jpg" type="verso"/>are made. Those in excess of the
                    first hundred will be placed upon the list for the second work to be issued,
                    should they so desire.</p>
                <p>The price will be Five Dollars, paper; Six Dollars, extra cloth, top edge gilt.
                    Subscriptions will be received by Messrs. J. M. Bradstreet &amp; Son, of the
                    Bradstreet Press, 18 Beekman Street, New York, and by Messrs. John Penington<!-- <ptr target="n0331"/> --> &amp; Son, 127 S. 7th Street,
                    Philadelphia. The prices of future publications will be duly announced. They
                    will vary according to the size and illustrations of each volume.</p>
