                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman.</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have indeed been extremely sorry to hear firstly from the transmitted paper of July
                23 and then from your kind letter of July 31, that your prospects of recovering your
                health seem to have darkened forever. You are no old man, and I had always hoped
                that your giant frame at last should supersede the lurking enemy. Even yet I won't
                give up the hope. That you don't give up your literary activity is to me a good
                token!</p>

            <p>From Kristian Elster<!-- <ptr target="n0216"/> --> I have not heard myself in a very long
                time, and I don't wonder that he has not written to you. He is a true virginal
                nature with the shyness of a virgin. As he was nearly suffocated by the dullness and
                coarse materialism of the Norwegian Society<!-- <ptr target="n0447"/> -->, I pressed him for
                two years ago (when he had previously sent me some very fine articles for my
                periodical) to come for some months to Copenhagen. I introduced [him] to some of the
                leading literary men and in some rich families, but he did not come to them and I
                myself must fetch him in his lodging, when I would see him. It seemed to him to be
                an intrusion to pay a visit, when not expressly asked to come! This is the fruit of
                a lonely education in stern and harsh national surroundings. The Norsemen can be
                described in the shy ones and the impudent ones.
                Björnson<!-- editorial note --> and Ole Bull<!-- <ptr target="n0455"/> --> are of the
                last sort, Elster of the first. The meanest sort&#8212;as usual&#8212;has first
                produced <hi rend="italic">its</hi> gifted men: when the better sort in its time has
                sprung into flowers, they shall all be forgotten. Then as truly as Denmark is at
                this moment doing the principal part of the intellectual work of the Scandinavian
                race, its accomplishment is kept back to Norway.</p>

            <p>The intellectual work of the Scandinavian race! What a humiliating thought to us
                Danes, that Hans Christian Andersen<!-- <ptr target="n0039"/> --> shall be nearly our only <choice>
                    <orig>representant</orig>
                    <reg>representative</reg>
                </choice> to the world. There are men in Denmark of such an intellectual greatness
                that Andersen was not reaching to their knees. The world did to his last days take
                the selfish old man for a child; the spirit of the Danish people is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> child; it [is] a warrior with the sword in his hand
                bleeding from combats, when he fought one against seven, with great thoughts of his
                brow and stern resolution in his eyes! At last Andersen lived only among our rich
                Jewish families, who endured all his whims and harshness, hoping to be gilt by his
                frame. He was buried as he had lived. The King and the Crown Prince were in the
                church, reporters for foreign papers, also from America, swarmed everywhere; but
                there was no wet eye in whole assembly.</p>

            <p>But our time shall come! Most probably America, in the next century, shall be the
                vanguard of humanity, its greatest leading power. But <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
                eyes will not be open to see the outlines filled your bold hand has drawn. As <choice>
                    <orig>representants</orig>
                    <reg>representatives</reg>
                </choice> for mental power and intellectual vigor such people as Bret Harte<!-- <ptr target="n0293"/> --> and Mark Twain<!-- editorial note --> are fainting away into
                ridiculousness. <hi rend="italic">Ours</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>
                future. You have no idea of the intellectual decay that in Germany is accompanying
                the political grandeur of the country. In June I met with professors and teachers of
                the university who in all earnest were Buddhists, believers of nothings, or properly
                spoken, believing that <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> is the true reality of the
                existence of world and man. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the dark and black gulf
                that Goethe<!-- <ptr target="n0270"/> --> and Schiller<!-- editorial note --> decked with the
                flowers and branches of their genius. At present the flowers and foliage are fading,
                and the black fathomless abyss of despair opens its giant yawn to the horrified
                mind. The faith, the youth, the hope, the vigor of spirits, the soaring flight of
                lofty aspiration, is only to be found in Scandinavia. Martin Luther<!-- <ptr target="n0371"/> --> spoke the prophetic word: in the north is the place of refuge!
                The day of the fulfillment is near.</p>

            <p>I have never doubted that I could make myself understood to you, and a letter of
                business or concerning the usual affairs of human life I could most probably write
                without faults at all, when I did take pains with it. But all the striking
                expressions, all the elaborate work of the thought, is fading away beneath my
                feather, when treating more difficult matters in English. I am never saying exactly
                what I would say, and you know, my dear friend, that this is a great pain to anyone
                who is accustomed to clothe his thoughts in the garment of language. I shall be glad
                to receive your new books. A Danish philosopher defines a hero as a man who is
                holding on the possible against probability.</p>
