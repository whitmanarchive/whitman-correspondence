            <p>It touches us all deeply, but more especially myself, that you shd continue to write
                to us so often &amp; in such good spirits in spite of your "catarrhal crises" "bad

                you write to few people now except your dear sister<ptr target="n0285"/> &amp; myself. 
                I cannot tell you how that piece of news touched me, filling my heart at once 
                with humiliation and pride; &amp; I can only say thanks, my dear, good old friend, 
                for this signal token of your love, &amp; God bless you now &amp; for ever for it.</p>

            <p>I have had two good letters from HLT<ptr target="n4267"/> full of his

            <p>Last Sat I spent a few hours at Blackpool, where my mother,<ptr target="loc.02519_n5"/> sister<ptr target="loc.02519_n6"/> &amp; nephew<ptr target="loc.02519_n7"/> are
                staying for a few days</p>
            <p>It is a town upon the Lancashire Coast, 40 miles from Bolton &amp; a favourite resort

                my dear little nephew&#8212;donkey-riding, building sandcastles, digging &amp;
                romping.</p>
            <p>The country is now robed in autumn tints, the fields all glowing

                the air. (By the way it has often struck me that that sound fits

            <p>Warry's letter is a good long one &amp; tells me all the particulars that I longed so
                much to know. I must try &amp; send him a few lines by this mail.</p>
            <p>Wallace's stay was brief but I understand that he is coming back to you on his return
