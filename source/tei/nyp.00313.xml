                    dealt mostly with Jeff and his children (Trent Collection, Duke University).
                </note>&#8212;I was glad to hear all the things you wrote&#8212; every thing,
                however little, is interesting, when you are kept in nearly all the time&#8212; I
                have rec'd a very good letter from Hannah this morning&#8212;she writes in good

                told you in my last, I am getting along well, but it is very, very slow&#8212;I
                cannot begin to apply my brain to regular work yet&#8212; though, for all that, I

                        sympathetic to Walt Whitman. Croly, described in <hi rend="italic"

                    Whitman expressed hope that she and Walt Whitman could visit Mary during the

                    without limping" (Trent Collection, Duke University). </note>&#8212;if you write
