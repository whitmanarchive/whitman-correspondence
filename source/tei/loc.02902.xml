                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The MS. to&#8212;hand<ptr target="loc.02902_n1"/>
            </p> 
            <p>I am very glad indeed, &#38; thankful, for all the capital suggestions &#38;
                amendments you have made. I have followed them all, or am doing it. I have a good
                many little additions to make myself&#8212;things which the close work of
                concordance-making suggested to me. I will cut out everything you advise. As
                to Ballou<ptr target="n4106"/> &#38; Scovel,<ptr target="loc.03298_n10"/> I will cut out nearly
                everything of Ballou's retaining only a little to put with large quotations from
                Scovel's article. I can improve that personal chapter very much by working it over,
                smoothing down &#38; melding things together more. </p>
            <p>How wd that MS&#8212;"Of That Blithe Throat" &amp;c&#8212;You gave me, do for a fac-simile page
                to put into the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02902.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Bibliography where I speak of your typographical finesse &#38;c? Or wd you prefer 
                to send me a clean draft of something in case the publishers
                thought best to give the fac-simile? People like to see the erasures &#38;c I
                believe. </p>
            <p>I have thought that I might perhaps get more from Chatto &#38; Windus if I guaranteed
                them for three years against the republication of the book in this country. I am
                going to copyright it, here right away, or very soon. What wd you say to this&#8212;guaranteeing the British publisher the market? </p>
            <ab> An error in L. of G. </ab>
            <p>By the way I suppose of course you have noticed that the characters "&#167; 9" of the
                Salut are by mistake omitted in L. of G.<ptr target="loc.02902_n3"/></p>
            <p>I have a nice letter form Scovel wh. I shall answer. </p>
            <p>The hot weather has <unclear reason="damage" resp="#smb" cert="low">worked</unclear> on me a
                little too. </p>
            <closer>
                <salute> As ever dear Walt </salute>
                <signed>W.S. Kennedy</signed>
            </closer>
            <postscript>
                <p> I will omit Conway<ptr target="n4105"/>  &#38; Goldsmith entirely, &#38; not sorry to do it. </p>
                <!--this bit is in the left margin-->
                <p> If Morse<ptr target="n0862"/> makes a bust satisfactory to you, I shall have
                    picture of it in the book. </p>
