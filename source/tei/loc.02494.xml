                <salute>My Dear Old Friend,</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>This afternoon I recd. your kind p.c. of June 23rd<ptr target="loc.02494_n2"/> &amp; thank you for it with all my heart. 
                I at once sent it on to Wallace.<ptr target="n6121"/></p>
            <p>I was very pleased to note that at the time of writing you were "keeping tolerably fairly" 
                &amp; that you were "free from marked pain or bother."&#8212;from which I conclude 
                that <hi rend="underline">on the whole</hi> you are
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02494.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                maintaining the slight improvement which the last few weeks have brought you. 
                For this "small mercy" we are very grateful, but we wd like to hear of your
                getting out-of-doors again, without any return of the old unpleasant sensations.</p>
            <p>Glad to hear, too, that H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> &amp; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> 
                are "well &amp; flourishing." Please give them &amp; Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> 
                my kindest regards.</p>
            <p>So Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> leaves on July 8th by the "Britannic"<ptr target="loc.08072_n2"/>&#8212;a really 
                splendid ship. She passed our steamer,
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02494.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                the "British Prince," when I was going to America<ptr target="loc.02496_n3"/> &amp; we had a good look at her.</p>
            <p>The Doctor will probably arrive in Liverpool about July 15th or 16th &amp; as Bolton 
                is only 30 miles from Liverpool we shall expect to see him soon after his arrival &amp;
                he will make my house his home during his stay amongst us.</p>
            <p>Wallace called here last night, during my absence from town on business, &amp; left one 
                of the "Good Byes"<ptr target="loc.02485_n5"/> &amp; two of the portraits for me. One of the
                latter ("The Laughing Philosopher"<ptr target="loc.02494_n3"/>) appears in my photograph of the interior of 
                John Burroughs's<ptr target="n0129"/>

                study at West Park.</p>
            <p>I particularly like the large head &amp; will copy it as well as one or two of the others</p>
            <p>Saturday July 4th 91 8p.m.</p>
            <p>I have just returned from Anderton where Wentworth Dixon,<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> 
                Mrs. Dixon<ptr target="n5001"/> &amp; boy<ptr target="n5001"/> have been spending the afternoon with J.W. Wallace</p>
            <p>We walked through beautiful Rivington to the secluded spot&#8212;christened by J.W.W. "Anderton
            College"&#8212;where we celebrated your birthday<ptr target="loc.02494_n4"/></p>
            <p>The day was gloriously fine&#8212;the sun streaming
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02494.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                out of a cloud-dappled sky of deepest azure, down upon lake, wood, moorland &amp; hill, 
                the heat tempered by a gentle refreshing breeze which sighed thro' the arboreal 
                roof of our sylvan assembly room.</p>
            <p>While sitting there we mooted the proposal I mentioned in my last letter to H L.T. 
                &amp; wh. he has mentioned in the postscript of his letter to you viz. to send him
                across the Atlantic to see you.<ptr target="loc.02494_n5"/> We are all very anxious for
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02494.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                him to do so &amp; every thing is being done to pave the way for him &amp; to induce him to go. 
                The only thing now awaiting is his consent &amp; that I regret to say we have not yet got. 
                We are sure that the trip would do him a great deal of good &amp; we know that he longs
                to see you but I think he is rather afraid of the excitement
                But we must wait a little &amp; try him again before we give up the idea.
                Perhaps a word from <hi rend="underline">you</hi> would help us.</p>
                <p>But my time is up. Good night &amp; god bless you</p>
