              <p>It was with much regret that we felt compelled to leave you in your sickness last
                  week. We hold you in affectionate remembrance as we pass over the waters to England
                  where once we hoped to have had your company. We beg that you will send us from <pb
                      xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_no.00115.jpg" type="verso"/> time to time as

                  us also who love you.</p>
              <p>Our passage across the whole way has been nearly as smooth as a duck pond, and my
                  health has been very much benefitted by it.</p>
              <p>I bear your messages of love and remembrance to your many friends in <pb

                  without my privileges of personal fellowship with you, honour and love you. I hope
                  that the knowledge of this may often cheer and console you in hours of pain and
                  weariness. Alys,<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> my faithful secretary, joins me in the
                  expression of the hearty affection with which I am always</p>
