                <salute/>Dear friends all</opener>
            <p>I have come on some 200 miles further north &amp; west (from Niagara) and am now very
                pleasantly quartered in Sarnia, Canada West, at the house
                of Mr and Mrs Pardee. (Mr P is one of the Queen's big
                officers here, &amp; a tip-top fellow) I am writing this on Lake Huron. The weather
                is fine, &amp; the country looks first rate. Susan I take every thing very easy,
                &amp; so far I have felt unusually well &amp; comfortable in health. George you
                would be interested in the way they farm here, it is a noble farming country but
                very different from Jersey new, plenty of good wood, hard soil, rather
                wet.&#8212;wheat, grass, barley &amp;c mainly&#8212;not much corn &amp; hardly any
                rye&#8212;good for potatoes&#8212;all later<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_gt.00024_large.jpg" type="verso"/>&#8212;I enclose
                you a letter I have written for the papers<ptr target="loc.04260_n1"/>&#8212;George, Harry &amp; Mont, it will
                give you some idea of my goings about here&#8212;Susan I know you will be interested
                in it&#8212;(I shall send it you in a paper here, in about five days, &amp; then I
                want you to give it to Debby)&#8212;Harry, how are you getting along?&#8212;Edward
                Carpenter's address is 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton England&#8212;The waters here Lake Huron &amp; St Clair river are as fine as I ever saw,
                &amp; alive with steamers &amp; sail craft&#8212;Every body is kind &amp;
                hospitable wherever I go&#8212;<choice><orig>to morrow</orig><reg>tomorrow</reg></choice> forenoon I am to visit a Chippewa Indian
                village out a ways&#8212;&amp; in the evening a moonlight steamboat excursion up
                Lake Huron, they have prepared for us. I often think of you all. If any of you write,
                direct to me London, Ontario, Canada &amp; I will get it. (3 cent stamp only
                required) Harry you write, dear boy&#8212;I go back to London Thursday&#8212;</p>
