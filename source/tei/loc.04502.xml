            <p>Y'rs, &amp; the third kind solicitation, rec'd; to wh' I hurriedly respond.<ptr target="loc.04502_n1"/> 
                The answer to such questions ought to be the thoughts and results of a life time &amp; w'd need a big volume.
                Seems to me, indeed, the whole varied machinery, intellect, &amp; even emotion, of the civilized universe, these years, 
                are working toward the answer. 
                (My own books, poems &amp; prose, have been a direct &amp; indirect attempt at contribution.) No doubt what will be sent you 
                will be salutary &amp; valuable, &amp; all fit in. 
                Though the constituents of "perfect manhood" are much the same all lands &amp; times, they will always be shifted &amp; 
                graduated a good deal by conditions, and especially by the United States. 
                Then I sh'd say, with emphasis, we c'd not have (all things consider'd) any better chances than mainly exist in these 
                States to-day—common education, general inquiry, freedom, the press, Christianity, travel, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
                But perhaps I may vary and help by growling a little as follows: For one thing out of many, the tendency in this 
                Commonwealth seems to favor &amp; call for &amp; breed specially <hi rend="underline">smart men</hi>. 
                To describe it (for reasons) extra sharply I sh'd say we New Worlders are in danger of turning out the trickiest, 
                slyest, cutest, most cheating people that ever lived. 
                Those qualities are getting radically in our business, politics, literature, manners, and filtering in our essential 
                character. All the great cities exhibit them—probably New York most of all. 
                They taint the splendid &amp; healthy American qualities, &amp; had 
                better be well understood like a threatening danger, &amp; well confronted &amp; provided against.
