            <p>This, from "The Poetry of the Future", prompts me to address you:</p>

                infinitely more. George Eliot<!--<ptr target="n3044"/>--> knows that now. Mrs. Browning<!--<ptr target="n3045"/>--> knew it while she dwelt
                in flesh. She, among women, and Bacon among men, they found their Christ and knew

                <p>Carlyle,<!--<ptr target="n0139"/>--> like Wordsworth, had neither wit nor humor, nor the musical sense. (O

                    performers both, I do not find in either Browning or George Eliot the
                    musical sense of Mrs. Browning or even Charlotte Bront&#235;. There are
                    deep-sea soundings of the musical <hi rend="underline">soul</hi>, beyond

                <p>Wordsworth felt Bacon. He did not feel&#8212;poet that he was&#8212;the myth <choice>
                    <orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>, which so exasperated the critic's acumen in Pope<!--<ptr target="n3048"/>--> and in Coleridge.<!--<ptr target="n3049"/>--> Wordsworth
                    like Bacon was (or at least aimed to be) a Reformer of Poetry. To either, if
                    poetry had no <hi rend="underline">use</hi>, to Wordsworth if it had not
                    divinest use, away with it. Why cumbereth it the ground? Wordsworth like
                    Bacon was patient, elaborate, methodical. He is <choice>
                        <abbr>e'en</abbr>
                        <expan>even</expan>
                    </choice> content to <hi rend="underline">plod</hi> to his ends. And was not
                    Bacon? But the quick, fine, <hi rend="underline">instinctive</hi> ear for harmony was lacking in
                    Wordsworth. Bacon was all eye, all ear, all touch. Bacon was ever "mediating on that celestial harmony" he
                    felt all about him. Wit&#8212;humor&#8212;these,
                    moreover, were lacking in Wordsworth, and without them no modern poet can hope to
                    be a dramatic poet in any high sense. Had Wordsworth been the <hi
                        rend="underline">humanitarian</hi> Bacon was, or approaching Bacon in this
                    respect, the French Revolution would have struck deeper chords in him than it
                    did; but the chords were not there to strike. Wordsworth was <hi

                            >selfy</unclear></hi> as Milton<!--<ptr target="n0415"/>--> was The
                    Puritanic leaven was
                    not quite out even of Wordsworth, which is so offensive in his friend Southey. Bacon, through his mother, was
                    certainly thus leavened&#8212;but the age of <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                        facs="loc.01199.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> licence and splendid pageantry and
                    personal and material heroism neutralized all evil effects, which when the

                    austere and spiteful. Bacon was a "bashful" man. He
                    tells us so himself, and was "without arrogancy or overweening"; Most
                    devout, most Catholic, and at the same time (as Emerson says of <choice>
                        <orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>, in touching upon the Sonnets&#8212;those
                    soul-and-body-tell-tale Sonnets, Mr. Whitman) "the most
                    susceptible of human beings". But do you recall Wordsworth's Preface to the
