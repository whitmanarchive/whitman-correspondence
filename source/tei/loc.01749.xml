            <p>Your letter, with cheering wishes &amp; prophecies came last Tuesday&#8212;God bless you, boy&#8212;for all such things help much&#8212;I had a bad spell this morning&#8212;have something of the kind pretty often&#8212;Still it seems certain I am improving, 
                generally,&#8212;&amp; that my general strength is better <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01749.002.jpg" type="verso"/>I am not near as bad 
                as I was five weeks ago&#8212;have some hours in which I feel quite like myself again&#8212;Keep up good heart nearly all the time&#8212;&amp; you must too, dear son.
            </p>
            
            <p>&#8212;So I see Beau Hickman<ptr target="loc.01749_n1"/> has died of a stroke of paralysis&#8212;in the paper this morning 
                I see a piece about his body being resurrected from potter's field&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete I see a collision of some trains on the <choice><abbr>B.</abbr><expan>Baltimore</expan></choice> &amp; <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Potomac</expan></choice> road reported 
                in the tunnel at Baltimore yesterday morning early in which a brakeman named Hawkinson<ptr target="loc.01749_n2"/> was instantly killed&#8212;</p>

            <p>I was over to Philadelphia yesterday&#8212;there is a large reading room, the Mercantile Library, 
                10th st. where I go occasionally&#8212;it is quite handy&#8212;they have all the papers 
                from every where&#8212;have the <choice><abbr>Wash.</abbr><expan>Washington</expan></choice> Chronicle Capital, &amp;c.&#8212;Then I took a ride 
                in the Market st. cars, &amp; was caught in a violent rain at ½ past 7 coming home&#8212;the moment I got home, it <choice><orig>stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice>, &amp; cleared off a beautiful moonlit night.&#8212;It is clear and pretty hot here to-day&#8212;I am sitting here in the front room 
                in the same big old mahogany chair I gave mother 20 years ago, by the open 
                window writing this&#8212;I am feeling better since breakfast.

            <p>Pete the papers you sent came last Monday all right&#8212;I have rec'd a letter from Chas Eldridge&#8212;&amp; another from Walter Godey, the young man who is working for me as my substitute in the office&#8212;all was going on well in the office&#8212;I send a couple of papers to-day&#8212;nothing particular&#8212;send the <hi rend="underline">Herald</hi>
            </p>
            
            <p>Did I tell you that a doctor<ptr target="loc.01749_n3"/> I have talked with here says my real disease is <hi rend="underline">the brain not being properly furnished 
                and nourished with blood</hi>&#8212;(it is a disease the doctors call <hi rend="underline">cerebral anâemia</hi>)&#8212;the doctor says it has been long a-coming, &amp; will be long a-going&#8212;says I will get over it though&#8212;says the <hi rend="underline">paralysis</hi> comes from that, &amp; that it (the paralysis) is not very 'formidable'&#8212;I am following Dr. Drinkard's advice, taking no medicine, living very carefully&#8212;</p>
