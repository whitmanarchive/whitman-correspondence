        <salute>Dear Rudolf Schmidt<ptr target="n0793"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>The Danish edition <hi rend="italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</hi>, of my Democratic
          Vistas<ptr target="n0189"/>, has reached me to&#8211;day, (one copy, complete,
        paper&#8211;bound, and two instalments of loose sheets)&#8212;makes a handsome little book,
        very neatly &amp; appropriately printed &amp; bound&#8212;It is a great, deep, joy to me to
        be thus in communion with thoughtful &amp; democratic men &amp; women in the Scandinavian
        countries&#8212;I think much, much of it&#8212;&amp; of you as the medium of it. </p>

      <p>I suppose you <choice>
          <orig>rec'd</orig>
          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice> my letter from here of Jan. 25&#8212;about my illness, paralysis&#8212;(&amp; the
        papers I sent giving some details of it.) I am still unwell&#8212;Cannot work any&#8212;<choice>
          <orig>To&#8211;day</orig>
          <reg>Today</reg>
        </choice> I send you <hi rend="italic">Harper's Magazine</hi><ptr target="n0290"/> for
        February, with a piece<ptr target="rlc.00009_n1"/> I have written to idealize our great
        Pacific half of America<ptr target="n0578"/>, (the future <hi rend="italic">better
        half</hi>)&#8212;also a N. Y. <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, with a poem, (my latest,) <hi
          rend="italic">Prayer of Columbus</hi>.<ptr target="rlc.00009_n2"/> So you will see I
        cannot desist from writing, sick or well. </p>

      <p>Clemens Petersen I see his pieces occasionally in the magazines&#8212;I have sent you one
        or two, formerly&#8212;I only met him that time, over two years ago, I mentioned<ptr
          target="rlc.00009_n3"/>&#8212;have not seen any thing of his lately in print. You speak of
        a jaunt or tour in Germany&#8212;O how I should like to be with you &amp; go around with
        you, in some of those quaint old cities &amp; spots&#8212;the motherhood, (or rather
        grandmotherhood) of so much in this New World. Don't fail, my dear friend, to write me at
        least as soon as you return. Mention whether you have <choice>
          <orig>rec'd</orig>
          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice> the paper, (N. Y. <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi>) with <choice>
          <orig>acc't</orig>
          <reg>account</reg>
        </choice> of my illness<ptr target="rlc.00009_n4"/>&#8212;also February <hi rend="italic"
          >Harper's</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, by this mail&#8212;I like to hear
        specifically whether the papers and letters I send, reach you all right&#8212;address me
        here, Camden, N. Jersey, until further notice. (On papers, printed matter, &amp;c. don't
        write any thing on wrappers, but only address, as our post office law strictly prohibits
        it.) </p>

      <p>As I am laid up here, very lonesome, your letters will be doubly welcome. I am saving up
        for you some pieces on <hi rend="italic">American humor</hi>, which I will send, when ready.
        About <hi rend="italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</hi> I shall next time have something further
        to say. I enclose in Harper's, two copies, proof of my portrait&#8212;wood engraving,<ptr
          target="rlc.00009_n5"/> rough but good, lately made&#8212;looks quite like me&#8212;(for
        all my sickness, which is pretty serious, I keep much the same in flesh &amp; face.) It is
        mild &amp; pleasant here to&#8211;day as I write, middle of the day&#8212;I am sitting here
        with open doors, the bright sun shining&#8212;Don't fail to write me&#8212;try to take some
        time of an hour's leisure&#8212;I like to hear about your people there&#8212;about the
          lady<ptr target="rlc.00009_n6"/> you spoke of who was interested in <hi rend="italic"
          >Democratic Vistas</hi>&#8212;&amp; the Professor<ptr target="rlc.00009_n7"/> you once
        wrote of also&#8212;about Bjornsen also. </p>
