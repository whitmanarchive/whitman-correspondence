            </opener>
            <p>A few offhand words only while the opportunity exists (my last chance for this
                mail.)</p>
            <p>Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> called on me just before I left the office tonight
                &amp; walked with me to the Station. He had just received "<hi rend="underline">Good-Bye My Fancy</hi>"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> &amp; lent it to me that I
                might look it over tonight.</p>
            <p>I took the first opportunity of doing so, &amp; have read, I think, all the<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01192_large.jpg" type="verso"/> matter that I had
                not previously seen, &amp; glanced through the whole book in its
                ensemble.—</p>
            <p>I will not attempt any description of my emotions &amp; thoughts in doing
                so.—But it has been a sacred hour with me, full of deep, complex &amp; tender
                feelings &amp; thoughts.</p>
            <p>When I have leisure I hope to read it with greater care &amp; to absorb it as fully
                as may be.</p>
            <p>How I long to know how you are now! My thoughts are with you continually.<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01193_large.jpg" type="recto"/></p>
            <p>But as this American mail arrived in Bolton late, any communications to me will not
                be delivered here till tomorrow morning. How eagerly I shall await the postman's
                visit!</p>
            <p>The weather here all this week has been wet &amp; cold (for the time of year.) I hope
                it is better with you for <hi rend="underline">your</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>R.K. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> is coming here to spend the week end with
                me, &amp; on Sunday (your birthday)<ptr target="loc.04713_n2"/> D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston &amp;
                perhaps one or two other friends will come over.—I propose to read extracts
                from your books &amp; to discuss your teaching in reference<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01194_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to Religion—(but
                informally— &amp; if the weather permits—outdoors) At any rate we shall
                unite in loving thoughts &amp; talk about you, &amp; in best wishes. (I wished to
                have a full meeting of the friends<ptr target="loc.04708_n4"/> but different circumstances &amp; my own health
                prevent it).</p>
            <p>I thank God that you have been enabled to finish your work so nobly &amp; so
                fillingly. I pray Him that your remaining life may be visibly blessed by
                Him—as indeed I doubt not but it <hi rend="underline">will</hi>.</p>
            <p>(Like the evening songs of birds, <hi rend="underline">your</hi> even'g songs seem to
                me more penetrating &amp; sweeter—more to touch the soul than the more joyous
                &amp; stronger songs" you sang before—blending with them &amp; confirming them. Loving
                congratulations to you)</p>
