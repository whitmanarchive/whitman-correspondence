                continues to keep her faculties—reason—methods of domestic
                usage—Yet—but I cannot describe her
                appearce—attenuated. We have taken up our winter 
                carpet—an undertaking—and Han will be compelled to have
                the matrass she sleeps on, made over, at a cost of $6.<hi rend="underline">50</hi>—It 
                has become so hard—and Walt she needs a cheap warm
                shawl—and drawers—she has been patching for months, 
                any thing that will hold together—old stock of mine.

                looks pitifull—does not sleep well. Brahma roosters make 
                such discord at early morning—and men currying horses—and 
                chirping birds! I rise at 5 o'clock and care for myself—help wash—as 
                she directs—sunday morning perhaps—hang out on Monday.</p>
            <p>I received a present of 5 dollars a few days ago, which helps—I 
                wear pants—the same for three years—growing old of course—have nice
              paintings in reseve—cant sell—provisions high—Write to Lou.
