         <p>Your letter come to-day. Every thing with us is pretty much the same. Mother is pretty much the same. Some days she [is] better, and some not so well. She has taken a good many sulphur vapor baths. She takes one every other day. She goes down in the cars to the baths, in Willoughby street near the City Hall.<ptr target="duk.00378_n2"/> Sometimes Mat <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="duk.00378.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>goes with her, [and once in] a while she goes [alo]ne. They are rather agreeable to take&#8212;they make one sweat extremely. Mother goes about the same, around the house. She has better use of her arms and wrists than she did there one time&#8212;but an hour or two, now and then, generally in the morning, she has bad pains. Her appetite is pretty good. The weather here lately has been awful&#8212;three days the heat was as <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="duk.00378.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>bad as I ever knew it&#8212;so I think that had something to do with mother's feeling weak. To-day it is much cooler.</p>
            <p>Jeff and Martha and Cis<ptr target="duk.00378_n3"/> and Eddy are all well. Jess is the same as usual&#8212;he works every day in the yard. He does not seem to mind the heat. He is employed in the store-house, where they are continually busy preparing stores, provisions, to send off in the different vessels. He assists in that.</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="duk.00378.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>We are all very glad the 13th is coming home&#8212;mother especially. There have been so many accounts of shameful negligence, or worse, in the commissariat of your reg't. that there must be <hi rend="italic">something</hi> in it&#8212;notwithstanding you speak very lightly of the complaints in your letters. The <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi>, of course, makes the worst of it, every day, to stop men from enlisting.<ptr target="duk.00378_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>All of us here think the rebellion as good as broke&#8212;no matter if the war does continue for months yet.</p>
