                good deal lately, I have opened them &amp; read quite a good deal in them—they
                are queer books, the very finest of printing &amp; paper &amp; some odd pictures<ptr target="loc.03901_n1"/>—I got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist
                yesterday—she is improving—the rest all well—</p>
            <p>—We have had a rough hard winter, all around—Keeps me in mostly, but I make a
                dash out now &amp; then—I still keep pretty well this winter—if it
                hadn't been so cold I should have been down to see you—Ed how do you like
                being home again? But I think you are contented most any where—how is the
                nag? I was out once or twice sleighing—my brother took me—his mare
                Nelly is in fine condition—pretty lively—makes things fly
                sometimes</p>

            <p>I have been in all day reading &amp; writing—I have put up two sets of my
                books, to send off this evening's mail, to purchasers<ptr target="loc.03901_n2"/>—a very quiet day, but I have enjoyed it—outside it is cold and
                half-cloudy, not an inviting day out—</p>
            <p>—Well Mont have you found any chance yet at telegraphing? I think the best thing a
                fellow can do this weather, is to stay home &amp; keep warm,—but when the
                spring opens then make a dash somewhere—Van I suppose will make a
                farmer—well if he is satisfied, it is about as good as anything, I don't know
                but better—</p>
            <p>There comes my call to dinner, &amp; I shall go for it
                without delay &amp; finish my helter-skelter letter afterwards.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="underline">Dinner all right</hi>, baked beef pie—I am now going out to see one of the ferry men a friend, very sick,—I have
                provided a bottle of brandy to take him, as I understand the doctor orders milk
                punch—there is a good deal of sickness around here, much diphtheria—Well
                I must stop—Good bye &amp; Good bless you friends Susan, George, &amp; Harry
                dear—</p>
