               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have not heard from George, except a note he wrote me a couple of days after he got back from his furlough&#8212;I think it likely the regiment has gone with its corps to the west, to the Kentucky or Tennessee region <ptr target="loc.00765_n1"/>&#8212;Burnside at last accounts was in Cincinnati&#8212;Well it will be a change for George, if he is out there&#8212;I sent a long letter to Han last Saturday, enclosed George's note to me. Mother, when you or Jeff writes again, tell me if my papers &amp; <hi rend="smallcaps">MSS</hi> are all right&#8212;I should be very sorry indeed if they got scattered, or used up or any thing&#8212;<hi rend="italic">especially</hi> the copy of Leaves of Grass covered in blue paper, and the little MS book "Drum Taps," &amp; the MS tied up in the square, spotted (stone-paper) loose covers&#8212;I want them all carefully kept.</p>
            <p>Mother, it is quite a snow storm here this morning&#8212;the ground is an inch and a half deep with snow&#8212;and it is snowing &amp; drizzling&#8212;but I feel very independent in my stout army-boots, I go any where. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> felt quite well of my deafness and cold in my head for four days or so, but it is back again bad as ever this morning.</p>
            <p>Dear mother, I wrote the above, in my room&#8212;I have now come down to Major Hapgood's office. I do not find any thing from home, and no particular news in the paper this morning&#8212;no news about the Ninth Army Corps, or where they are. I find a good letter from one of my New York boys, (Fifth Avenue)&#8212;a young fellow named Hugo Fritsch,<ptr target="loc.00765_n2"/> son of the Austrian Consul General&#8212;he writes me a long first-rate letter this morning&#8212;he too speaks about the opera, (like Jeff) he goes there a good deal&#8212;says that Medori,<ptr target="loc.00765_n3"/> the soprano, as Norma, made the greatest success ever seen&#8212;says that the whole company there now, the singers, are very fine&#8212;all this I write for Jeff &amp; Mat&#8212;I hope they will go once in a while when it is convenient&#8212;</p>
            <p>It is a most disagreeable day here, mother, walking poshy and a rain and drizzle&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is nothing new with me&#8212;no particular sight for an office, that I can count on. But I can make enough with the papers, for the present necessities&#8212;I hear that the paymaster, Major Yard,<ptr target="loc.00765_n4"/> that pays the 51st, has gone on West. I suppose to Cincinnati, or wherever the brigade has gone&#8212;of course to pay up&#8212;he pays up to 1st of March&#8212;All the Army is going to be paid up to 1st March every where.</p>    
            <p>Mother, I hope you are well and hearty as usual&#8212;I am so glad you are none of you going to move&#8212;I would like to have the pleasure of Miss Mannahatta Whitman's company, the first fine forenoon, if it were possible&#8212;I think we might have first rate times, for one day at any rate&#8212;I hope she will not forget her Uncle Walt<ptr target="loc.00765_n5"/>&#8212;I received a note from Probasco,<ptr target="loc.00765_n6"/> requesting me not to put his name in my next letter&#8212;I appreciate his motive, and wish to please him always&#8212;but in this matter I shall do what I think appropriate&#8212;Mother, I see some very interesting persons here&#8212;a young master's mate, who was on the Hatteras, when surprised &amp; broadsided by the Alabama, Capt. Semmes<ptr target="loc.00765_n7"/>&#8212;he gave me a very good acc't of it all&#8212;then Capt. Mullin,<ptr target="loc.00765_n8"/> U. S. Army (engineer), who has been six years out in the Rocky Mt's, making a gov't road, 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla Walla&#8212;very, very interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely with them&#8212;Dearest mother, I shall have great yarns to spin, when I come home&#8212;I am not a bit home sick, yet I should [like] to see you &amp; Mat, very very much&#8212;One thinks of the <hi rend="italic">vimmen</hi> when he is away.</p>
