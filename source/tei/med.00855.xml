            <p>I am still here neither worse nor better—but keeping in my sick room &amp; in
                the big old chair—have had something to see to in printing my books &amp; it
                has probably done me more good than harm—&amp; it all (the printing) has gone
                on &amp; is going on satisfactorily—Herbert<ptr target="n0262"/> has arrived
                all right &amp; is stopping over in Philadelphia—quite busy—he is to
                have a studio there &amp; paint—rather thinks (but it has not yet been settled
                definitely) he has secured a studio already—He has been over to see me—a
                short visit this time—He looks hearty &amp; handsome, red &amp; fat &amp;
                first rate—he will come down before long &amp; see you &amp; then tell you
                more fully his plans—wh' he did not to-day—but I believe he thinks
                stopping, working &amp; painting here for a year to come—</p>
            <p>I have not heard from any of you for quite a while—send me word how things
                are—tell me abt Debbys<ptr target="n0844c"/> baby<ptr target="med.00855_n2"/>
                &amp; everything—George<ptr target="n0852c"/> &amp; Harry,<ptr target="loc.03930_n3"/> as far as you know—&amp; how are you
                yourself—I am sitting here alone up in my room, writing this—Mrs:
                    Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> has been an hour or two ago out to the City Hall to
                pay my taxes (over $34)<ptr target="med.00855_n3"/>—&amp; some thief there
                stole a nice valuable silk sun umbrella from her—gone—Hope this will
                find you well—&amp; God bless all—</p>
