            <p>Well Maurice every thing here goes on much the same, &amp; fairly enough—As I
                write it is abt <date when="1889-05-25">1 pm, Saturday</date>, clear but not sunny &amp; neither cool nor
                warm—I have just had a midday currying—partial bowel action two hours
                ago—feel middling (but cold in the head, or catarrh or gathering or whatever
                it is yet)—get out a little in the wheel chair<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/>—they are all going out
                Mrs. D<ptr target="n6113"/> and all to an East Indian ship for two or three hours this
                afternoon—I told Ed<ptr target="n4319"/> to go too as he was invited, (&amp; he will go)—the
                ship is here from Bombay, &amp; our sailor boys know some of their sailors—We
                broke a big bottle of good wine yesterday &amp; all of us (seven—me at the
                head) drank health &amp; respects to Queen Victoria—(it was her birth day you
                know—)—</p>
            <p>—My big dinner<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/> (wh' however I shall probably not eat, and only be there a few minutes
                if at all) is coming on swimmingly they say—Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is to make the
                responsive speech to the British toast to friends—Col. Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> coming is
                uncertain—<hi rend="underline">not</hi> Howells<ptr target="n4317"/> nor Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> nor Aldrich<ptr target="loc.07586_n3"/>
                nor Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/> to be here—no word yet fr'm Stedman<ptr target="n1043"/> (Achilles laid up in his tent
                moody, am rather sorry but not to blame)—</p>
            <p><date when="1889-05-25">Night—9½</date>—Have been out twice to day in the wheel-chair—short
                excursions—T B H<ptr target="n4146"/> has been here this evn'g—150 dinner tickets
                taken now—y'r letter rec'd by H<ptr target="n4267"/>—(I have not seen it
                yet)—coolish temperature three days &amp; now stopping sweat exudation &amp;
                somewhat bad for me but well enough as I sit here alone every thing quiet, but some
                sailors from the ship down stairs</p>
            <p><date when="1889-05-26"><hi rend="underline">Sunday</hi></date>

                A clouded rather rawish day—Am going up to my friends Mr &amp; Mrs: Harned's in
                an hour, in my wheel chair—to stay a few minutes &amp; probably get a drink of
                champagne—(of which H always has the best &amp; treats me to
                galore)—</p>
            <p>—Havn't now had such a tipple for a year.</p>
            <p>—Nothing particular to write—my head is a little heavy &amp;
                thick—no pocket-book copies<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> yet, but I count on them in a couple of
                days—All goes fairly as c'd be expected—</p>
