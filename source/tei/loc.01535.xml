                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I arrived home last night between 11 and 12, all safe &amp; sound—found
                    mother<ptr target="n0705"/> up, waiting for me—It was dark &amp; stormy,
                as rain had set in about 9—had quite a pleasant journey—took a chair in
                the reserved seat car, 50 cts extra—plenty of room &amp; a very easy riding
                car—thought while I was sitting up here now in my room wait'g for dinner I
                would write a line to boy Pete—</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01535.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p><hi rend="underline">Thursday forenoon</hi></p>
            <p>The weather is very fine now here—plenty cool enough—I went over to New
                York yesterday afternoon &amp; evening—took a ride up &amp; down
                Broadway—am now laying off &amp; taking it easy in my room—find it very
                pleasant here—fall just as natural into habits of doing nothing—lie on
                the sofa &amp; read the papers—come up punctually to my meals—sleep a
                great deal—&amp; take every thing very quietly—</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Friday</hi>—Pete I will finish this scribbling letter,
                &amp; send it off, so you will get it for Sunday—I am feeling well &amp;
                enjoying myself doing nothing, spending a great deal of time with my mother, &amp;
                going out a few hours every day on the river or over to New York—I hope you
                are feeling <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01535.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> all
                right, &amp; that every thing is lovely—I believe that is all this time— </p>
            <p>Love to you dear son, &amp; you must keep a good heart through all the tribulations
                &amp; botherations, not only of railroading but life generally</p>
            <p>I find that Foster the "car assassin,"<ptr target="n0243"/> is an old driver &amp;
                conductor that I knew quite well—he was a very good man, very respectable,
                only a fool when drunk—it is the saddest case I know. He has three fine
                children—the public is down upon him savage—&amp; I suppose no hope for
                him.</p>
