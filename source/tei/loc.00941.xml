               <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Many thanks for your long good letter, which I am not going now to answer. I write at the request of Charlie Eldridge who said that he should be too busy to-day to do so, to tell you that he and Mrs. Cooper are to leave here either in the 8 A.M. or the 11 A.M. train on Monday next, for Philadelphia, and he is to remain at her house that night.<ptr target="loc.00941_n1"/> They want you to leave New York so as to meet them, and stay at her house too. Her <pb facs="loc.00941.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
               <pb facs="loc.00941.003.jpg" type="recto"/>residence is No. 1429 Girard Avenue, between Broad &amp; 15th Streets.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Cooper has been coaxing, persuading, begging, entreating, commanding even William to go on with them too, but he says he
<hi rend="italic">can't</hi>
, &amp; I know him well enough to know that she can't move him.<ptr target="loc.00941_n2"/> She wants me to go on also, but I know that I shall not unless some strong pressure is brought to bear between now &amp; Monday, for I can see that William does not want to spare me.</p>
            <p>They fully count upon seeing you. Charlie will remain at Mrs. C's till Tuesday<pb facs="loc.00941.004.jpg" type="recto"/> evening. By the way&#8212;he got your letter, &amp; was delighted with it, he said it was worthy to be set in a gold frame &amp; to which Wm. &amp; I assented most heartily.</p>
            <p>Dear Walt, we long for you, William sighs for you, &amp; I feel as if a large part of myself were out of the city,&#8212;I shall give you a good big kiss when you come, so depend upon it.</p>
            <p>My
<hi rend="italic">love</hi>
to your good, noble mother, whom I shall some day know. Kiss her for me&#8212;&amp; tell her that I love her boy <pb facs="loc.00941.005.jpg" type="verso"/>
               <pb facs="loc.00941.006.jpg" type="recto"/>Walt. I want to see those splendid children too. But I shall some day. Good bye.</p>
            <p>No more now, but if you are not back in a few days I will write you a good long letter, and answer yours fully.</p>
            <p>Oh! do you know that Mrs. Howells is in New York, has been there a week.<ptr target="loc.00941_n3"/>
            </p>
            <closer>
               <salute>With love from all&#8212;</salute>
               <signed>Yours Nelly.</signed>
