                        J. Ramsdell was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
                        Huntington Library), Walt Whitman called him "chief clerk." In the 1869
                        Directory, he was listed as a correspondent. On May 8, 1867,
                        <!-- "In his <ref target="xxx.00000">May 8, 1867, letter</ref> ..." -->
                    Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend<ptr target="n0643"/>, the journalist
                        (1841&#8211;1914), accorded to Walt Whitman&#8212;"a stupendous genius,"
                        "the song of a God." On July 17, 1867,
                        <!-- "In his <ref target="xxx.00000">July 17, 1867, letter</ref> ..." --> he
                        asked Walt Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
                        against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman
                        Edward D. Holbrook (1836&#8211;1870). Actually, on July 12, 1867, Walt
                        Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Report<lb/>on the<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Charges</hi> submitted by<lb/><hi rend="italic">Hon. E. D.

                        Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all in Walt
                        Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by Stanbery but written by
                        Walt Whitman, dated July 20, 1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report
                        is hereby adopted by me, &#38; ordered to stand as the decision of this
                        Office in the Case, so far as now presented." On July 22, 1867,
                        <!-- "In his <ref target="xxx.00000">July 22, 1867, letter</ref>, ..." -->
                        Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness." (Ramsdell's letters are in the
                        Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly wrote to Walt Whitman on
                        June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on August 9, 1867 (Yale).
                        <!-- "Judge Kelly wrote to Walt Whitman on <ref target="xxx.00000">June (?) 21, 1867</ref>, and again on <ref target="xxx.00000">August 9, 1867</ref>." -->
                        On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
                        (1832&#8211;1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be
                        appointed to a position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives).

            <p>Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of 17th, &#38; we have had
                quite a talk&#8212; he seems to be a wide-awake, candid young man, &#38; makes a
                good impression on me. He spoke of you, of his own affairs &#38; fortunes, of Idaho,
                of Judge Kelly, Holbrook &#38;c. &#38;c&#8212;In respect to Judge Kelly, &#38; his
                matter, I had already formed my opinion, &#38; made out my Report several days
                ago&#8212;The Attorney General is full of anxiety &#38; debate, on the big things
                that are up, just now&#8212;&#38; has not been able to hear the Report, &#38; decide
                upon it&#8212;but he told me this morning he would try to do so very shortly. If he
                decides as I have advised him, you &#38; Cummins will have no reason to be
                dissatisfied.</p>

            <p>Dear Friend, I rec'd your note when you left here&#8212;it was sent on to me at
                Brooklyn. I value George Alfred Townsend's appreciation of L. of G. It was
                magnificent. Where is Townsend now? I hope it may happen one day that I may have him
                near at hand, that we get to be friends&#8212;such is in my mind.</p>

            <p>There is nothing new in my affairs&#8212;all goes on as usual in the office. I am
                well. After a hot spell of a week, during the last of June, we have had the finest
                kind of weather here the most of this month&#8212;</p>

                <salute>Remembrance &#38; love to you, wife, &#38; baby too. Farewell.</salute>
