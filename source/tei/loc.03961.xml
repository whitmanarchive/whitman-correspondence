            </opener>
            <p>Thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas was spent has tempted me to write a
                few lines to you to-night. We all spent that day very happily with Debbie,<ptr target="loc.03961_n1"/> New Years day we expect them to spend with us. How nice it
                would be if you could join us. I don't know whether any of the folks at home will be
                able to come over or not. Van<ptr target="n0883"/> or Ed<ptr target="n0589"/> may
                come but Pap<ptr target="loc.03961_n2"/> does not go out a great deal since his illness. He does not improve as
                rapidly as we would<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00094.jpg" type="verso"/> like
                to have him. Mother<ptr target="loc.03961_n3"/> was pretty well for her when we were home last.</p>
            <p>We are all well excepting the baby<ptr target="loc.03961_n4"/> who has quite a severe cold at present.</p>
            <p>We do not expect to remain here another year. Harry<ptr target="n0590"/> has made
                application to the R. R. Co, but has not received much encouragement yet. I suppose
                you have heard of Mont's<ptr target="n0910"/> removal to Elwood N. J. He is quite
                well pleased with his new home.</p>
            <p>Please accept my thanks for the $2 which you sent the children.<ptr target="loc.03961_n5"/></p>
            <p>I hope this letter will find you in good health and spirits. With best wishes and
                love from us all I say good night.</p>
