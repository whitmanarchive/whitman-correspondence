            <p>Thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas was spent has tempted me to write a
                few lines to you to-night. We all spent that day very happily with <gap
                    reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="7"/>, New Years day we expect them to
                spend with us. How nice it would be if you could join us. I don't know whether any
                of the folks at home will be able to come over or not. Van<ptr target="n0883"/> or
                    Ed<ptr target="n0589"/> may come but Pap does not go out a great deal since his
                illness. He does not improve as rapidly as we would<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.00094.jpg" type="verso"/> like to have him. <gap reason="illegible"
                    unit="chars" quantity="7"/> was pretty well for her when we were home last.</p>

            <p>We are all well excepting the baby who has quite a sever cold at present.</p>



            <p>We do not expect to remain here another year. Harry<ptr target="n0590"/> has made
                application to the R. R. Co, but has not received much encouragement yet. I suppose
                you have heard of Mont's<ptr target="n0910"/> removal to Elwood N. J. He is quite
                well pleased with his new home.</p>
            <p>Please accept my thanks for the $2 which you sent the children.</p>
            <p>I hope this letter will find you in good health and spirits. With best wishes and
                love from us all I say good night.</p>
