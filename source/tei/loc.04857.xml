            </opener>
            <p>It was my intention to have noted my recent call upon you, with my expressions of the great pleasure that visit had given me, 
                but I have been prevented doing so, from having taken cold in my eyes, subjecting me to a sort of vagabond life for the past week.</p>
            <p>To meet one of whom I had heard &#38; read so much, I feared was denied me, as I had never received any acknowledgment of the 
                letter I sent you some three years since.</p>
            <p>You think you never received           
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02153.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02154.jpg" type="recto"/>
            such a communication.</p>
            <p>I wrote you at the time of Mr Farnam<ptr target="loc.04856_n2"/> of New Haven commencing the <hi rend="underline">Whitman</hi> genealogy, 
                hoping I could have the pleasure of sending to him so worthy &#38; honorable a branch of the old tree, as yourself would be&#8212;</p>
            <p>Perhaps when the weather becomes more spring like, I will bring the volumes over to you to examine &#38; you will be able to 
            <hi rend="underline">point out your position</hi></p>
            <p>You would like to see it, would you not?</p>
            <p>Let me thank you for the very kind gift of your photos. I greatly prize them, doubly so, as containing your 
                <hi rend="underline">autograph</hi>.</p> 
            <p>Do you often see Mr Childs<ptr target="n6102"/> I hear he is a friend, &#38; a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> friend of yours?</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02155.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I fear I may weary you, if I say more. I should be delighted to have you acknowledge this note, if you feel, 
                it will not be a task&#8212;</p>
            <p>Accept dear friend, my hearty best wishes that your life may be prolonged &#38; your declining years made comfortable to the close.</p>
