                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>You can hardly imagine what pleasure it gave me to see your bold strong hand again on
                a letter, you look as well as ever in that address, &#38; it is such a satisfaction
                to know you are really better. I believe now you will come out of this crisis as
                you have <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01163.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> out of
                so many others &#38; be yourself again. It is too bad that you have to be cooped up
                in that way. If you could only get up strength of body &#38; will to get out!
                What do you eat? I have made the discovery that raw clams are very
                strengthening &#38; that the juice is a tonic, but I need not tell an old Long
                Islander like you the virtue there is in clams. I eat them from the shell without
                any seasoning. Try some. This cool weather I know you enjoy.<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.01163.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> It sounded so good to hear you
                speak of its raining. It is dry as a bone here, no rain for many weeks, my potato
                crop is cut short 50 per cent, &#38; all my young vines &#38; plants are suffering
                much. Indeed we have had no rain to speak of since the great snow storm in March. I
                hope O'C.<ptr target="n2002"/> is really mending. If he comes to Camden let me know &#38; I will
                come down too &#38; see him. I try to keep absorbed in my farm operations. It is
                much better for me than to mope about nibbling at literature. I want to get <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01163.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> a sniff of salt
                water again this summer or early fall, &#38; I do so hope you will be well enough to
                join me. I know the sight of the sea would give you a lift. We are all well. My
                regards to Horace Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/> Tell me something about him when you
                write again. I am very anxious to see <hi rend="underline">November Boughs</hi><ptr target="n3999"/> I do
                no writing at all. Send me a card when you are in the mood.</p>
