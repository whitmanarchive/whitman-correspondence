                <salute>Dear Friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>You were so good as to call yourself so, in my book,&#8212;that I value more than you
                guess,&#8212;and may I not claim you now?</p>
            <p>If you received all the letters I write you <hi rend="underline">mentally</hi>, you
                would have sufficient kindling for a long Winter. I do even begin them upon paper,
                but words, that I know how to put together, seem so weak against the truth<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00356_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of which I wish to
                speak, that the unfinished letter goes into the waste basket, first torn into inch
                pieces. On yesterday I sent some flowers to speak for me. They know how to talk
                without tiring you. They can speak of divine things without mockery. They can speak
                of tenderness, without annoying you. They can talk with you of "India"&#8212;of
                "more than India"&#8212;and you will understand each other. I do not know what
                flowers you love best. If I were arranging flowers for your room, I should have
                masses of one kind, if I<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00357_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> could. In this case, I thought a few sprays of the more delicate
                miracles, quite a variety of them, might enable you to fancy you had left your room,
                and were picking them as you walked. I wanted to see them put in the box, but the
                kind hearted man who held them in his care assured me they had better remain
                unpacked till just before the express train left Boston. The dear little crocuses I
                picked from my own tiny spot of earth, and sent each one laden with
                loving wishes. May they carry their messages safely.</p>
            <p>I wonder if you have an idea how much I enjoyed<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00358_large.jpg" type="verso"/> being with you&#8212;or how hard it
                was for me to leave you.</p>
            <p>(I worried after leaving, lest I had stayed too long a time and wearied you.) I have
                longed to see you as I never longed to see the Alps. There seemed no prospect of my
                going. The way seemed hedged. Then&#8212;a friend opened the gate and let me through. I
                have not called on Mrs. Fairchild<ptr target="har.00049_n3"/> yet. I have been too
                busy, but am anticipating the pleasure soon. How good it will be to speak with her
                of you.</p>
            <p>Good bye&#8212;good bye&#8212;</p>
            <p>God bless you ever&#8212;ever&#8212;!</p>
            <p>Sometime America will know what you have done for her. In the meantime, souls, here
                and there, in sorrow<ptr target="loc.03950_n1"/> and in gladness, think of you and
                love you.</p>
