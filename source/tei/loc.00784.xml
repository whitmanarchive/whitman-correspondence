               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The letter from George &amp; your lines, &amp; a few from Jeff came yesterday, &amp; I was glad indeed to be certain that George had got back to Kentucky safe &amp; well<ptr target="loc.00784_n1"/>&#8212;while so many fall that we know or, what is about as bad, get sick or hurt in the fight, &amp; lay in hospital, it seems almost a miracle that George should have gone through so much, south &amp; north &amp; east and west, &amp; been in so many hard-fought battles, &amp; thousands of miles of weary &amp; exhausting marches, &amp; yet have stood it so, &amp; be yet alive &amp; in good health &amp; spirits&#8212;O mother, what would we [have] done if it had been otherwise&#8212;if he had met the fate of so many we know&#8212;if he had been killed or badly hurt in some of those battles&#8212;I get thinking about it sometimes, &amp; it works upon me so I have to stop &amp; turn my mind on something else&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I feel bad enough about Andrew, &amp; I know it must be so with you too&#8212;one don't know what do do&#8212;if we had money he would be welcome to it, if it would do any good&#8212;if George's money comes from Kentucky this last time &amp; you think some of it would do Andrew any real good I advise you to take some &amp; give him&#8212;I think it would be proper &amp; George would approve of it<ptr target="loc.00784_n2"/>&#8212;I believe there is not much but trouble in this world, &amp; if one hasn't any for himself he has it made up by having it brought close to him through others, &amp; that is sometimes worse than to have it touch one'sself&#8212;Mother, you must not let Andrew's case &amp; the poor condition of his household comforts &amp;c. work upon you, for I fear you will, but, mother, it's no use to worry about such things&#8212;I have seen now so much horrors that befal men, (so bad &amp; such suffering &amp; mutilations, &amp;c that the poor men can defy their fate to do any thing more or any harder misfortune or worse agony) that I sometimes think I have grown callous&#8212;but, no, I don't think it is that, but nothing of ordinary misfortune seems as it used to, &amp; death itself has lost all its terrors&#8212;I have seen so many cases in which it was so welcome &amp; such a relief&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, you must just resign yourself to things that occur&#8212;but I hardly think it is necessary to give you any charge about it, for I think you have done so for many years, &amp; stood it all with good courage&#8212;</p>
            <p>We have a second attack of the hot weather&#8212;Sunday was the most burning day I ever yet saw&#8212;it is very dry &amp; dusty here, but to-day we are having a middling good breeze&#8212;I feel pretty well, &amp; whenever the weather for a day or so is passably cool I feel really first rate, so I anticipate the cooler season with pleasure&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I believe I wrote to you I had a letter in N Y Times, Sunday 16th<ptr target="loc.00784_n3"/>&#8212;I shall try to write others &amp; more frequently&#8212;the three Eagles came safe, I was glad to get them&#8212;I sent them &amp; another paper to George&#8212;Mother, you none of you ever mention whether you get my letters, but I suppose they come safe&#8212;it is not impossible I may miss some week, but I have not missed a single one for months past&#8212;I wish I could send you something worth while &amp; I wish I could send something for Andrew&#8212;Mother, write me exactly how it is with him<ptr target="loc.00784_n4"/>&#8212;I see you still have letters from Heyde, I hope they dont never come just as you are setting down to the table, for they would take away your appetite I know&#8212;Mother, I have some idea Han is getting some better, it is only my idea somehow&#8212;I hope it is so from the bottom of my heart&#8212;did you hear from Mary's Fanny<ptr target="loc.00784_n5"/> since?</p>
            <p>And how are Mat's girls&#8212;so, Mannahatta, you tear Uncle George's letters, do you?<ptr target="loc.00784_n6"/>&#8212;you mustn't do so, little girl, nor Uncle Walt's either, but when you get to be a big girl, you must have them all nice, &amp; read them, for grandmother will perhaps leave them to you in her will, if you behave like a lady&#8212;Matty, my dear sister, how are you getting along? I really want to see you, bad&#8212;&amp; the baby too&#8212;well may be we shall all come together &amp; have some good times yet&#8212;Jeff, I hope by next week this time we shall be in possession of Charleston&#8212;some papers say Burnside is moving for Knoxville, but it is doubtful&#8212;I think the 9th Corps might take a rest awhile anyhow&#8212;good bye, mother&#8212;</p>
