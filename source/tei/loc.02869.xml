            </opener>

            <p>Shall you never find it in your heart to say a kind word to
                me again? or a word of some sort? Surely I must have
                written what displeased you very much that you should turn
                away from me as the tone of your last letter &amp; the ten
                months' silence which have followed seem 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02869.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to express to <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">me
                with</supplied> such emphasis. But if so, tell me of it, tell me how&#8212;
                with perfect candour, I am worthy of that&#8212;a willing learner
                &amp; striver; not afraid of the pain of looking my own faults &amp;
                shortcomings steadily in the face. Or it may be my words have
                led you to do me some kind of injustice in thought,&#8212;I then
                could defend myself. But if it is simply that 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02869.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                you are preoccupied, 
                too busy&#8212;perhaps very eagerly beset by hundreds
                like myself whose hearts are so drawn out of their breasts by
                your Poems that they cannot rest without striving, some
                way or other, to draw near to you personally&#8212;then write
                once more &amp; tell me so &amp; I will learn to be content. But
                please let it be a letter just like the first three you wrote: &amp;
                do not fear that I shall take it 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02869.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to mean anything it doesn't
                mean. I shall never do that again, though it was natural
                enough at first, with the deep unquestioning belief I had that
                I did but answer a call; that I not only might, but ought, on
                pain of being untrue to the greatest, sweetest instincts &amp;
                aspirations of my own soul, to answer it with all my heart &amp;
                strength &amp; life. I say to myself, I say to you as I did in my
                first letters, "This voice that has come to me from over the
                Atlantic is the one 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02869.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
                divine voice that has penetrated to my
                soul: is the utterance of a nature that sends out life giving
                warmth &amp; light to my inward self as actually as the Sun does
                to my body, &amp; draws me to it and shapes &amp; shall shape my
                course just as the Sun shapes the Earth's. "Interlocked in a
                vast similitude" indeed are these inner &amp; outer truths of our
                lives. It may be that this shaping of my life course toward
                you will have to be all inward
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02869.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                that to feed upon your words
                till they pass into the very substance &amp; action of my soul is
                all that will be given to me, &amp; the grateful yearning tender
                love growing ever deeper &amp; stronger out of that will have to go
                dumb &amp; actionless all my days here. But I can wait long,
                wait patiently; know well, realize more <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">clearly</supplied> indeed that <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">this</supplied> wingless, clouded, half-developed soul of me has a long,
                long novitiate to live through before it can 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02869.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
                meet &amp; answer
                yours on equal terms so as fully to satisfy you, to be in very
                truth &amp; deed a dear Friend, a chosen companion, a source of
                joy to you as you of light &amp; life to me. But that is what I
                will live &amp; die hoping &amp; striving for. That covers &amp; includes
                all the aspirations all the high hopes I am capable of. And
                were I to fall away from 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02869.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
                this belief it would be a fall into utter
                blackness &amp; despair, as one for whom the Sun in Heaven is
                blotted out.
