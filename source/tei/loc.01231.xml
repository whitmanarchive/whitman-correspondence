            </opener>
            
            <p>It is just dawn, but there is light enough to write by, and the birds in their old sweet 
                fashion are chirping in the little College garden outside. My first knowledge of you is 
                all entangled with that little garden. But that was six years ago; so you must not mind 
                me writing to you now because you understand, as I understand, that I am not drunk with 
                <hi rend="underline">new</hi> wine.</p>
            <p>My chief reason for writing (so I put it to myself) is that I can't help wishing you should 
                know that there are many here in England to whom your writings have been as the waking 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01231.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                up to a new day. I daresay you do not care, particularly, how your writings, as such, 
                are accepted; but I know that you do care that those thoughts you weary not to proclaim 
                should be seized upon by others over the world and become the central point of their lives,
                and that something even transcending all thought should knit together us in England &amp; 
                you in America by ties closer than thought &amp; life itself. When I say 'many', of course 
                I do not mean a multitude (I wish I did) but many individuals—each, himself (or 
                herself, for they are mostly women—fluid, courageous &amp; tender) the centre of 
                a new influence. All that you have said, the thoughts that you have given us, are 
                vital—they will grow—That is certain. You cannot know 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01231.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                anything better than that you have spoken the word which is on the lips of God today.</p>
            <p>And here, though dimly, I think I see the new, open, life which is to come: the spirit 
                moving backwards &amp; forwards beneath the old forms—strengthening &amp; re-shaping 
                the foundations <hi rend="underline">before</hi> it alters the superstructure: the growth 
                is organic too here I believe, but the flower is very very far and we do not dare to think 
                even what it will be like.</p>
            <p>There is no hope, almost none, from English respectability. Money eats into it, to the core. 
                The Church is effete. At school the sin which cannot be Forgiven is a false quantity. The 
                men are blindly material; low—to the most intellectual—Art &amp; the desire for 
                something like religion are only known as a continual sense of pain. Yet the women will 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01231.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                save us. I wish I could tell you what is being done by them—everywhere—in 
                private &amp; in public. The artisans too are shaping themselves. While society is capering 
                &amp; grimacing over their heads they are slowly coming to know their minds; and exactly as 
                they come to know their minds they come to the sense of power to fulfil them: and sweet will 
                the day be when the toys are wrested from the hands of the children and they too 
                <hi rend="underline">have</hi> to become men.</p>
            <p>You hardly know, I think, in America (where the life, though as yet material, is so intense) 
                what the relief is here to turn from the languid inanity of the well fed, to the clear hard 
                lines of the workman's face.</p>
            <p>Yesterday there came (to mend my door) a young workman with the old divine light in his 
                eyes—even <hi rend="underline">I</hi> call it old though 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01231.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                I am not 30—and perhaps, more than all, he has made me write to you. Because you have, as 
                it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually in my heart. (—and 
                others thank you, though they do not say so.) For you have made men to be not ashamed of the 
                noblest instinct of their nature. Women are beautiful; but, to some, there is that 
                <choice><abbr>wh'</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> passes the love of women.</p>
            <p>It is enough to live wherever the divine beauty of love may flash on men; but indeed its real 
                &amp; enduring light seems infinitely far from us in this our day. Between the splendid dawn 
                of Greek civilization and the high universal noon of Democracy there is a strange horror of 
                darkness on us. We look face to face upon each other, but we do not know.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01231.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>At the last, it is enough to know that the longed for realisation is possible—will be, has 
                been, <hi rend="underline">is</hi> even now somewhere—even though we find it not. The pain 
                of disappointment is, somewhere, the joy of fruition.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be, in time, with you in the New or with us in the Old world. Slowly—I 
                think—the fetters are falling from men's feet, the <hi rend="underline">cramps</hi> 
                &amp; crazes of the old superstitions are relaxing, the idiotic ignorance of class contempt 
                is dissipating. If men shall learn to accept one another simply &amp; without constraint, if 
                they shall cease to regard themselves because the emptiness of vanity is filled up with love, 
                and yet shall honour the free immeasurable gift of their own personality, delight in it &amp; 
                bask in it without false shames &amp; affectations—then your work will be accomplished: 
                and men 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01231.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                for the first time will know of what happiness they are capable.</p>
            <p>Dear friend, you are older &amp; wiser than me &amp; can accept all that I have said, with a 
                smile perhaps, but without any ill will. It is a pleasure to me to write to you, for there are 
                many things which I find it hard to say to any one here. And for my sake you must not mind 
                reading what I have written.</p>
            <p>As to myself, I was in Orders; but I have given that up—utterly. It was no good. Nor 
                does the university <hi rend="underline">do</hi>: there is nothing vital in it. Now I am 
                going away to lecture to working men &amp; women in the North. They at least desire to lay 
                hold of something with a real grasp. And I can give something of mathematics &amp; science. 
                It may be no use, but I shall see.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01231.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>You I suppose I shall not see. Yet if any one should come from your side to England—this 
                address will always find me. There are many who, if their pens were here, would send greetings 
                to you across the sea.</p>
            <p>Farewell: wherever the most common desires &amp; dreams of daily life are—wherever the 
                beloved opposition is, of hand to hand or of soul to soul—I sometimes think to meet you.</p>
            <p>I have finished this at night. All is silent again: and as at first I am yours</p>
