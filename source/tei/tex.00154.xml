            <p>I have grown better the last four or five days, &amp; don't have that pain in my head now.</p>
            <p>Well, mother, it is the middle of Tuesday afternoon, &amp; the carrier has just brought your letter, (though I see it was written Saturday.) Mother, your letter is the first news I have had of the fire&#8212;it must have been quite an exciting time&#8212;&amp; quite a sad loss, anyhow&#8212;</p>
            <p>I went to see Ristori, the great actress, the other night, &amp; was very much pleased&#8212;but don't want to go again.</p>
            <p>It has got pretty cold here the last two days&#8212;I wear my big old overcoat. Every thing goes on the same in the office&#8212;I have written again to Han&#8212;I send her some book or something to read, occasionally&#8212;I got a letter from Mrs. Price&#8212;Helen is not very well&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I will send you another <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, with Wm O'Connor's piece in. It seems as if things were going to brighten up about "Leaves of Grass." I rather think it is going to be republished in England.</p>
            <p>Well, mother, you must keep a good heart&#8212;and good bye for this time&#8212;</p>
