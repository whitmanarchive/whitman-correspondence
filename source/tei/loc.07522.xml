            <p>Good breakfast at 9½ of chocolate, toasted Graham bread &amp; broil'd chicken
                — enjoy'd all. Have rec'd a nice letter this mn'g f'm Mary Costelloe,<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> return'd to London city—all well—Pearsall
                    S[mith]<ptr target="loc.01350_n3"/> well as formerly, (one eye sight however
                quite quench'd)—Rec'd also an acc't (in Pall Mall Gaz: Oct: 28) of a visit to
                me f'm the good fellow, Mr Summers, M P,<ptr target="n4299"/> I believe mention'd to
                you in letter months ago<ptr target="loc.07522_n2"/>—I will send the acc't to
                you—the two paper notices Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> &amp; in
                the Phil: <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, (of N B,)<ptr target="n3999"/> must have now reach'd
                you—they were sent.</p>
            <p>Am pretty well, considering, but laggard &amp; a dull headache most of the
                time—partial bowel action this forenoon—I don't get out of my room at
                all—the 6th month now—Mr Musgrove<ptr target="loc.07541_n2"/> is kind
                active &amp; considerate all through—dull, darkish, damp here to day—I
                sit here the same, the sash a little open'd—very moderate—</p>
            <p><date when="1888-11-04"><hi rend="italic">Sunday noon</hi> Nov: 4</date>—Bright, sunny, quiet day—am
                feeling ab't my easiest—fair bowel movement—the big book<ptr target="n4151"/> gets
                on—title page has been made of a big medallion profile of me, (lettering on
                it)—suits me—am thinking (composing it now) of a short concluding note
                at end—will see how I can get it in shape—</p>

                    Corning<ptr target="n5001"/> have just call'd &amp; spent a short half hour (I
                don't know but I find myself <hi rend="italic">talking more</hi> than I used
                to—talking perhaps more than ever)—I enclose you several letters (I send
                them as a foil, your duties &amp; works there must be dry)—if you don't feel
                to read them, put it off for a better season, or put it aside altogether—I
                suppose Edward Wilkins<ptr target="n4319"/> will be here to-morrow—Mr M,<ptr target="loc.07239_n2"/> my
                present nurse, is sort o' <hi rend="italic">vexed</hi> ab't it all—he is a
                good fellow too, &amp; I am almost glum ab't his going—I liked him
                    well—Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> did not, &amp; has not—H remains
                &amp; is perfectly faithful &amp; I depend on him more than words could
                describe—y'r letter came last evn'g.</p>
