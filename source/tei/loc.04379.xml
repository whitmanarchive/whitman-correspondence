            <p>It is now Sunday evening—8-15—Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> &amp; I 
                have recently finished supper, &amp; I think I will write you a few lines.</p>
            <p>A beautiful day, clear, with warm sunshine. This morning I attended chapel—tallying 
                in my own experience your "Sunday with the Insane"<ptr target="loc.04379_n2"/>—sat afterwards
                for an hour and a half on a bench in the grounds here scribbling—the 
                sun shining warmly, crickets shrilling, the lawn, flower beds &amp; 
                trees (some changing colour)
                beautiful in the sunshine.—In the afternoon
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00898_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                I attended the Catholic service—At 5 oclock D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> took
                me for a drive to town &amp; round the country near. 
                Enjoyed it immensely. Quite struck by the general air of comfort &amp; 
                prosperity—the neat houses with grounds or 
                garden attached, the elbow room &amp; air space enjoyed by each—the 
                total absence of the overcrowding, smoke, dirt, &amp; foul air with which I am familiar. 
                The country—fertile &amp; beautiful—has not the mellow 
                domesticated character of English landscape, but retains a suspicion of wildness 
                &amp; unreclaimed Nature still. But, at every turn, it has its 
                own changeful beauty, &amp; always suggests freedom, expansion, 
                healthful conditions, &amp; room for growth.</p>
            <p>A beautiful &amp; typical September evening, mellow &amp; golden, but with a cool 
                air &amp; a steely zenith that made it bracing &amp; stimulating. 
                The moon shining down added to its beauty.</p>

            <p>I shall not soon forget our ride, &amp; our talks of you.—I  
                find, as I expected to find, that Dr Bucke grows upon me
                with further knowledge of him &amp; is a worthy friend of yours.—</p>
            <p>I had quite a talk yesterday afternoon with M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke<ptr target="n4273"/>—about 
                the D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> &amp; about your visit here 11 years ago. It seems that I occupy your room!<ptr target="loc.08139_n3"/> Am not I a proud man?
                It gives an additional interest to the view from my window to know that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> used to admire it.</p>
            <p>I write this in the Library—Dr B sitting to the right 
                reading—Pardee<ptr target="n4274"/> on the other side of the table. 
                Dr shewed me a short time ago two books on Egypt that you used to read.</p>
            <p>By the way, M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke told me a short time ago that 
                Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi> Richardson<ptr target="loc.04383_n6"/> is coming here on Tuesday, &amp; I
                hope to get him to talk a little about you.—</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00900_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>This afternoon I read an article on Carlyle<ptr target="n4301"/> by 
                Thoreau,<ptr target="hun.00052_n3"/> &amp; one sentence hit me rather hard. 
                T. said that many people went to <hi rend="underline">see</hi> 
                Carlyle who were not worthy to be <hi rend="underline">seen</hi> by him. 
                "That's <hi rend="underline">me</hi>" In writing to you, &amp; in coming to see you, 
                I feel that I am not worthy of so great &amp; dear a privilege. 
                But it is said that "love is a present for a mighty King,"<ptr target="loc.04379_n3"/> &amp; 
                I suppose it is for a mighty poet too. And you have my love for ever, &amp;
                more so as I know you better. And behind mine is the love of fellows who are 
                affectionate &amp; true &amp; good. Love &amp; honour to you from us all.</p> 
            <p>My letters from home contain such sentences as these. 
                "If you dare, give Walt's hand a grip for my wife<ptr target="loc.01476_n2"/> &amp; me" 
                (Wentworth Dixon.<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>) 
                "I would very much like you to give him <hi rend="underline">my</hi> love," 
                (R K Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/>). 
                "Please give my love &amp; best wishes to Walt Whitman" (W.A. Ferguson<ptr target="loc.02526_n3"/>)</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00901_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                <p>I have had 2 or 3 drives with Dr B. round the extensive grounds here.—Acres 
                &amp; acres of vegetables &amp; fruits in first rate condition. 
                Everything excellently arranged &amp; carried out.</p>
            <p>Have spent some time too in his office—looking over his collection of books &amp;c, 
                &amp; his series of photos of you. All intensely interesting to 
                me—<hi rend="underline">too</hi> interesting indeed, for it
                affects my sleep.</p>
            <p>It is a great &amp; wonderful privilege to me to be here in many ways, 
                &amp; I am thankful to Dr Bucke for his kindness &amp; to God for his mercy.—</p>
            <p>But I won't write any more now. With love to you, which only grows more tender, 
                &amp; with love to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> 
                &amp; Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &amp; to Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/>
