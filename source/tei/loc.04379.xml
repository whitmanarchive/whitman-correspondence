            <p>It is now Sunday evening&#8212;8-15&#8212;Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> &#38; I 
                have recently finished supper, &#38; I think I will write you a few lines.</p>
            <p>A beautiful day, clear, with warm sunshine. This morning I attended chapel&#8212;tallying 
                in my own experience your "Sunday with the Insane"<ptr target="loc.04379_n2"/>&#8212;sat afterwards
                for an hour and a half on a bench in the grounds here scribbling&#8212;the 
                sun shining warmly, crickets shrilling, the lawn, flower beds &#38; 
                trees (some changing colour)
                beautiful in the sunshine.&#8212;In the afternoon
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00898_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                I attended the Catholic service&#8212;At 5 oclock D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> took
                me for a drive to town &#38; round the country near. 
                Enjoyed it immensely. Quite struck by the general air of comfort &#38; 
                prosperity&#8212;the neat houses with grounds or 
                garden attached, the elbow room &#38; air space enjoyed by each&#8212;the 
                total absence of the overcrowding, smoke, dirt, &#38; foul air with which I am familiar. 
                The country&#8212;fertile &#38; beautiful&#8212;has not the mellow 
                domesticated character of English landscape, but retains a suspicion of wildness 
                &#38; unreclaimed Nature still. But, at every turn, it has its 
                own changeful beauty, &#38; always suggests freedom, expansion, 
                healthful conditions, &#38; room for growth.</p>
            <p>A beautiful &#38; typical September evening, mellow &#38; golden, but with a cool 
                air &#38; a steely zenith that made it bracing &#38; stimulating. 
                The moon shining down added to its beauty.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00899_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
            <p>I shall not soon forget our ride, &#38; our talks of you.&#8212;I  
                find, as I expected to find, that Dr Bucke grows upon me
                with further knowledge of him &#38; is a worthy friend of yours.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I had quite a talk yesterday afternoon with M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke<ptr target="n4273"/>&#8212;about 
                the D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> &#38; about your visit here 11 years ago. It seems that I occupy your room!<ptr target="loc.08139_n3"/> Am not I a proud man?
                It gives an additional interest to the view from my window to know that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> used to admire it.</p>
            <p>I write this in the Library&#8212;Dr B sitting to the right 
                reading&#8212;Pardee<ptr target="n4274"/> on the other side of the table. 
                Dr shewed me a short time ago two books on Egypt that you used to read.</p>
            <p>By the way, M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke told me a short time ago that 
                Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi> Richardson<ptr target="loc.04383_n6"/> is coming here on Tuesday, &#38; I
                hope to get him to talk a little about you.&#8212;</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00900_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>This afternoon I read an article on Carlyle<ptr target="n4301"/> by 
                Thoreau,<ptr target="hun.00052_n3"/> &#38; one sentence hit me rather hard. 
                T. said that many people went to <hi rend="underline">see</hi> 
                Carlyle who were not worthy to be <hi rend="underline">seen</hi> by him. 
                "That's <hi rend="underline">me</hi>" In writing to you, &#38; in coming to see you, 
                I feel that I am not worthy of so great &#38; dear a privilege. 
                But it is said that "love is a present for a mighty King,"<ptr target="loc.04379_n3"/> &#38; 
                I suppose it is for a mighty poet too. And you have my love for ever, &#38;
                more so as I know you better. And behind mine is the love of fellows who are 
                affectionate &#38; true &#38; good. Love &#38; honour to you from us all.</p> 
            <p>My letters from home contain such sentences as these. 
                "If you dare, give Walt's hand a grip for my wife<ptr target="loc.01476_n2"/> &#38; me" 
                (Wentworth Dixon.<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>) 
                "I would very much like you to give him <hi rend="underline">my</hi> love," 
                (R K Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/>). 
                "Please give my love &#38; best wishes to Walt Whitman" (W.A. Ferguson<ptr target="loc.02526_n3"/>)</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00901_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                <p>I have had 2 or 3 drives with Dr B. round the extensive grounds here.&#8212;Acres 
                &#38; acres of vegetables &#38; fruits in first rate condition. 
                Everything excellently arranged &#38; carried out.</p>
            <p>Have spent some time too in his office&#8212;looking over his collection of books &#38;c, 
                &#38; his series of photos of you. All intensely interesting to 
                me&#8212;<hi rend="underline">too</hi> interesting indeed, for it
                affects my sleep.</p>
            <p>It is a great &#38; wonderful privilege to me to be here in many ways, 
                &#38; I am thankful to Dr Bucke for his kindness &#38; to God for his mercy.&#8212;</p>
            <p>But I won't write any more now. With love to you, which only grows more tender, 
                &#38; with love to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> 
                &#38; Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38; to Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/>
