            <p>Your last letter, dear Walt, that of 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi> of January,<ptr target="nyp.00625_n1"/> is very cheering, it has quite set me up, and really I
                do not see why you should not go on for quite a while and have a middling good time
                especially when the pleasant weather comes. I feel more and more that you <hi rend="underline">must</hi> get out in the spring and that the new leaves &amp;
                flowers will be your best medicine. Ed Carpenter's<ptr target="n0141b"/> piece is
                    <hi rend="underline">good</hi>,<ptr target="nyp.00625_n2"/> I have written him a
                line. I have still only looked into Sarrazin's<ptr target="n3115"/> piece. Am fairly
                stuck fast for <hi rend="underline">time</hi> to do anything since the fire.<ptr target="nyp.00625_n4"/> I will
                gladly make an abstract of Sarrazin's piece but want to see Kennedy's<ptr target="n3039"/> and if that is sufficient there is no need of me doing it over
                again—we shall see.<ptr target="nyp.00625_n3"/> It seems as if the fire and
                matters arrising out of it will keep Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> and self back still
                another week. [W]e have set now 18<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst. for our trip
                East. I trust it will not be delayed beyond that date. I am more than ever anxious
                to get on with the meter now as Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> is out of a job and I
                want the meter to furnish him one [—] I have every confidence that it will do
                so. [—] We have glorious sleighing here now and I am enjoying it greatly, I
                get out every day about 4.30 till 6. and sometimes (in the way of business) get
                other drives. Today is charming [.] I should like to be out the whole of it! but I
                am on duty—no clergiman this morning so I had to preach! I am supposed to know
                every thing and do every thing and I just put a good face on it and get through the
                best I can.</p>
