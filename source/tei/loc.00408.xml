               <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>We hardly know what to think of not hearing from you  we certainly expected to have a letter from you this morning. Mother is quite anxious and of course fears that something has happened to you. Walt write to me at once wont you. I have written you two letters, one containing the $10 that Van Anden owed you, and another I mailed you last Sat. eve.<ptr target="loc.00408_n1"/> Mother gave me a letter to mail you on Monday but I forgot it till to-day. You must not tell mother about it. We are all well and as jolly as usual. Andrew does not seem to get much better. He was at our house to-day to dinner  his voice is still so that you can hardly here him speak.<ptr target="loc.00408_n2"/>
            </p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad.00330_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
         <p>We had a letter from George yesterday. He was at Mt Sterling Ken.<ptr target="loc.00408_n3"/> He seems to feel quite well and satisfied. Mother had a letter from Heyde. He says that she must fix up her third story room for Han an him and a lot of stuff. He says that Han must come home. He says that Han wants him to take a house and let her take a man and wife to board. He wants to know what he shall do with his business. How should he get along. All of which I am sure I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know how Mother can answer him. He is a case. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what to think <choice><abbr>abt</abbr><expan>about</expan></choice> him. Walt I <choice><sic>havnt</sic><corr>havn't</corr></choice> time to write you a long letter, and indeed I <choice><sic>havnt</sic><corr>havn't</corr></choice> anything to write about. I hope to hear from you soon. All send their love, Hattie particularly.</p>
