            <p>It is more than a week since I heard last from you&#8212;I hope you are keeping well.
                I have got a big blank book properly ruled and with printed headings for each page,
                all planned with great pains for a Walt Whitman <hi rend="underline"
                    >Bibliography</hi>.<ptr target="loc.07354_n2"/> Commenced working at it
                today&#8212;it will take months to complete it (working at it odd times)&#8212;I am
                entering in it in proper place and order all writing by or about a certain Walt
                Whitman. I find that what I am shortest in is first editions of poems and prose
                pieces by the said W.W.&#8212;I mean as there came out in newspapers and
                magazines&#8212;if you have any of these (especially early ones)</p>


            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_es.00769.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>that you do not especially want to keep I wish you would let me have them. I expect
                the new inspector (Mr Christie)<ptr target="n5000"/> up here tomorrow or next day.
                He will likely remain a couple of days.</p>

            <p>Mrs Bucke<ptr target="n4273"/> went to Sarnia yesterday for a short visit. We are all
                well. Are having perfect weather&#8212;neither hot nor cold&#8212;just right.</p>

            <p>How does the O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> "Preface" get on?<ptr
                    target="loc.07354_n3"/> I fear it is too hot down your way to do much&#8212;had
                a note from Mrs O'C.<ptr target="n4137"/> a few days ago&#8212;she seemed to be
                feeling the heat very much.</p>

            <p>No Willy Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> here yet. I hope (but scarcely dare expect) to see
                him this week.</p>

            <p>Been dipping into Ruskin lately&#8212;like him better than I ever did
                before&#8212;but he is too hard to please&#8212;ordinary modern folk are not to his
                taste&#8212;too bad!</p>
