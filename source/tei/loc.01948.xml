            <p>I received your letter<ptr target="n5002d"/> some three weeks ago, 
                but have not had much chance to answer it <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> now. 
                I am alone at home, with my brothers—Papa<ptr target="nyp.00175_n100"/> &amp; Mother are 
                gone visiting to Uncle John's Father's-in-law.<ptr target="n5001"/></p>            
            <p>Garrie<ptr target="loc.01948_n2"/> and I have been to school <choice><orig>to day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice>,—the 
                teacher was pretty cross.</p> 
            <p>A great many people are dying around here this winter and spring. I attended two funerals yesterday. 
                Our undertaker <choice><sic>hd</sic><corr>had</corr></choice> six orders for coffins last Saturday.</p>            
            <p>An old gentleman 65 years of age, was coming to our house with a basket

                last week—we went to New York Monday morning with the 
                first train and came back Tuesday night. Monday morning we went to Fulton Ferry, and found Uncle 
                George<ptr target="loc.03675_n3"/> at work, driving stage—We went up town in his stage, 
                &amp; then walked up to the Park, 
                where we spent about 2 Hours—saw a great many <choice><sic>anamiles</sic><corr>animals</corr></choice>, 
                a few birds, &amp;c, &amp;c., but the monkeys, were best of all—We then went down town, and 
                got dinner, then walked up <choice><sic>broadway</sic><corr>Broadway</corr></choice> to 14<hi rend="underline">th</hi> 
                St. here we met Uncle George, on his way down town, and Papa went with him, while George, &amp; I 
                went to a Museum of Art<ptr target="loc.01948_n1"/>—We saw a great many things to amuse us, 
                such as paintings, <gap reason="torn-away" quantity="1" unit="word"/>

                on wood &amp; on stone, ancient armour, ancient dishes, Books, &amp;c. &amp;c. When we came from there 
                we went to the <choice><abbr>cor.</abbr><expan>corner</expan></choice> of 14<hi rend="underline">th</hi> 
                St. &amp; <choice><abbr>B.way</abbr><expan>Broadway</expan></choice>, to meet Papa—we then walked 
                around, seeing all we could, till we got very tired—then we went and sat down awhile, &amp; then 
                up to 43<hi rend="underline">rd</hi> st. to meet Uncle George—then we soon went to bed.</p>            
            <p>Tuesday we took the street cars, &amp; went to the Park, walked through the Park, &amp; took the street 
                cars to High Bridge. Here we saw a fine structure—we were there awhile &amp; then took the

            <p>I have written this, but <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know if it will interest you or not.</p>            
            <p>There fell some snow Friday, &amp; is not gone yet, it is quite cold.

                Garrie, George, Dick, &amp; May, are amusing themselves by riding one another around the room, on their Backs.</p>            
            <p>Now, I have written a good long letter, &amp; you must answer it soon.</p>
