                <salute>Dear son Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of yesterday came this forenoon—that was a rather serious runaway 
                of cars in the tunnel a week ago—&amp; mighty lucky to get off as you all did—Pete I got a few lines from Parker Milburn—he told me you had a very bad 
                sore on a finger of right hand—they are plaguey bad things—I am in hopes yours will partly make up in giving you a little resting spell. 
                I sent you "the Children of the Abbey,"<ptr target="loc.01752_n1"/> an old novel that used to be all the rage—did you get it? To-day here is a great turn out 
                &amp; dedication of the <hi rend="underline">Masonic Temple</hi> in Philadelphia—it is truly a handsome &amp; noble building. 
                A rain last night here, &amp; to-day is really perfect. The Camden free masons marched 
                by here this morning, about 250, the finest collection of men I thought I ever saw, 
                but poor music, all brass, a lot of fat young Dutchmen, blowing as if they would burst, 
                &amp; making a hell of a hullabaloo—</p>
            
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01752.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Pete I am about the same—may be a little improved in general strength—had bad spells a good deal all the earlier part of the week—some very bad—but feel better yesterday &amp; to-day—I am making some calculations of the cool weather—think it may be favorable to me—did not go out any yesterday—shall try to get out this afternoon a couple of hours—I don't know a soul here,—am entirely alone—sometimes sit alone &amp; think, for two hours on a stretch—have not formed a single acquaintance here, any ways intimate—My sister-in-law 
                is very kind in all housekeeping things, cooks what I want, has first-rate coffee 
                for me &amp; something nice in the morning, &amp; keeps me a good bed &amp; room—All of which 
                is very acceptable—(then, for a fellow of my size, the <hi rend="underline">friendly presence 
                &amp; magnetism needed</hi>, somehow, is not here—I do not run foul of any)—Still I generally keep up very good heart—still think I shall get well—When I have my bad spells, I wait for them to fade out—I have got a letter 
                from Charley Towner—I am finishing this by the open window—still in the rooms 
                where my mother died, with all the old familiar things—but all drawing 
                to a close, as the new house is done, &amp; I shall move on Monday.
