                <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I was quite shocked to hear of Parker Milburn's death<ptr target="loc.01643_n1"/>&#8212;he was never very rugged, but he kept up so well, &amp; always had some cheerful, 
                lively thought or saying&#8212;I was far from anticipating this&#8212;I think he had very noble traits, 
                &amp; both you &amp; I liked him thoroughly&#8212;Pete, I hope he is better off&#8212;I will try to write a few words to Wash<ptr target="loc.01643_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete I have rec'd both your letters&#8212;I go out often in the Market st. cars 
                past the West Philadelphia depot you speak of, but never get out or go in there, 
                as it is a great depot, full of hurrying people, and hacks &amp; drivers, &amp; trains coming 
                &amp; going continually, &amp; people rushing &amp; crowding&#8212;too much excitement for me&#8212;So you saw Colein, in the Treasury&#8212;I saw him only a few minutes in a street car, 
                but he could give you some report of me from his own eyes,<ptr target="loc.01643_n3"/> &amp; that I know satisfied you better&#8212;I am feeling quite an improvement, 
                or let up, the last two days &amp; nights on the bad spell I spoke of 
                in my last letters&#8212;have slept better the last two nights.
            </p>

            <p>To-day as I write here, it is cloudy, &amp; feels a little like snow coming&#8212;it has been very mild here too&#8212;Pete, go up some time when you start out 
                early in the afternoon &amp; see Mrs. O'Connor, 1015 O Street near 11th&#8212;she will be very glad to see you. I hope you won't fail to go.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am feeling quite comfortable to-day, as I write. Pete I sometimes think if I was fixed 
                so that I had you with me every day, I should get well&#8212;good bye for this week, 
                my loving son&#8212;</p>
