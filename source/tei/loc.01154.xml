                /> I am just back from Roxbury where I went a week ago to make sugar in the old
                woods of my boyhood; had a pretty good time, though too much storm. Only my brother
                is now upon <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01154.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> the
                old farm. I have to go back there at least twice a year to ease my pain. Oh, the
                pathos of the old place where my youth was passed, where father &amp; mother lived
                &#38; died, &#38; where my heart has always been! </p> 
            <p> I have been pretty well since I saw you, except that I have been off my sleep a good
                deal. Just now I am having a streak of sleeplessness. I do not quite know what to
                make of it. To-day is <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01154.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> my birth-day, too, I am 49 today. I hope spring finds you
                better. I lately heard from you through J. W. Alexander, the artist. I think he will
                make a good picture of you.<ptr target="pru.00001_n1"/> He is a fine fellow. I am
                glad to hear of the projected new book.<ptr target="loc.01154_n2"
                /> I hope it is to be a reality. The title is
                good. My book "Signs &#38; Seasons" will be out this month. I do not think much of
                it,&#8212;the poorest of my books, I think. No news with me. I hope to see you in <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01154.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> May, as I go to
                Kentucky. I hope you will not try to face the summer again in Camden. It is very
                imprudent. A bright afternoon here, with remains of last nights snow still
                lingering. </p>
