            <p>A lovely &#38; perfect day here,<ptr target="loc.04388_n2"/>&#8212;air fresh &#38; sweet with pleasant breezes.</p>
            <p>Immediately after I wrote to you yesterday afternoon the sky became suddenly overspread 
                with stormclouds of wonderful beauty, &#38; presently the rain began to pour &#38; a 
                thunderstorm began.</p>
            <p>It was all over by tea time &#38; the evening was clear &#38; beautiful&#8212;the 
                bursts of cumulus cloud on the Eastern horizon glowing with wonderful
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00930_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                colours &#38; effects as Dr<ptr target="n0119"/> &#38; I walked across to the office in the evening.</p>
            <p>A pleasant evening, with delightful talks with Dr. He showed me a letter from you. We were both very much 
                pleased to hear per H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> of Dr. Longaker's<ptr target="loc.04788_n3"/> report. Glad to hear, too, that the oculist's 
                report was favourable.</p>
            <p>I have spent today very idly&#8212;giving the reins to my mood. But I have thoroughly enjoyed the perfect beauty 
                &#38; freshness of the day.</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00931_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I was at the office a short time this morning &#38;  was very pleased to receive a parcel of papers addressed to me 
                by you. Thank you for your constant kindness &#38; thought.</p>
            <p>The Dr. showed me the copy of "The Literary World" rec'd from you, with the marked par. on "Good Bye"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> 
                which I was pleased to read.<ptr target="loc.04388_n3"/> Since dinner I have looked through the two papers you sent, &#38; 
                dipped into the pamphlet on 
                "Swedenborg."<ptr target="n0609"/> This last, however, I will put aside
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00932_large.jpg" type="verso"/>     
                for another time.</p> 
            <p>Dr. is calling for me at 3 o'clock to go to town, so I write this brief note in the 
             hope that I may post it there.</p>
            <p>I hope that the day is equally beautiful with you, &#38; that you are fairly well. How it would 
             please me to hear that you have been out for a drive again!</p>
            <p>Give my affectionate regards to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; Warry.<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/></p>
