            <p>
                A lovely &#38; perfect day here,&#8212;air fresh &#38; sweet with pleasant breezes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately after I wrote to you yesterday afternoon the sky became suddenly overspread 
                with storm clouds of wonderful beauty, &#38; presently the rain began to pour &#38; a 
                thunderstorm began. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was all over by tea time &#38; the evening was clear &#38; beautiful&#8212;the 
                <unclear cert="low" resp="#kw" reason="illegible">bursts</unclear>
                of cumulus cloud on the Eastern horizon glowing with <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" quantity="2"/>

                colours &#38; effects as Dr.<ptr target="n0119"/> &#38; I walked across to the office in the evening. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A pleasant evening, with delightful talks with Dr. He showed me a letter from you. We were both very much 
                pleased to hear per H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> of Dr. Longaker's report. Glad to hear, too, that the oculist's 
                report was favourable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have spent today very idly&#8212;giving the reins to my mood. But I have thoroughly enjoyed the perfect beauty 
                &#38; freshness of the day. 
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00931_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>
                I was at the office a short time this morning &#38;  was very pleased to receive a parcel of papers addressed to me 
                by you. Thank you for your constant kindness &#38; thought. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Dr. showed me the copy of "The Literary World" rec'd from you, with the marked par. on "Good Bye" which I was 
                pleased to read. Since dinner I have looked through the two papers you sent, &#38; dipped into the pamphlet on 
                "Swedenborg." This last, however, I will put aside
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00932_large.jpg" type="verso"/>    
                for another time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. is calling for me at 3 o'clock to go to town, so I write this brief note in the hope that I may post it there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope that the day is equally beautiful with you, &#38; that you are fairly well. How it would please me to hear 
                that you have been out for a drive again! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Give my affectionate regards to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; Warry.<ptr target="loc.00668_n4"/>
