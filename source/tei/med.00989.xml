            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Thus saith the old song, and the advice is in the vein
                of true philosophy. Yes, <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi>&#8212;the purest kind, too, which seeks human
                happiness, and the beguiling pleasantly away of life's toilsome road. * * * I have
                often thought that the people of France are the wisest in the world; for under their
                coating of light-hearted fun&#8212;often levity&#8212;they hide from people's eyes, and from
                their own too, many things that the English, and we Americans, would sulk over half
                a lifetime. Cares <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come: the less you make of 'em, the less they really are.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>"Let's dance and sing!"</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Have not the (so called) wise heads made a great blunder,
                then, in putting down the joke, the careless jest, the bit of practical fun, the
                ever-recurring laugh, as signs of idle mind? To my notion, the jolliest chap is the
                deepest philosopher&#8212;though he may not know it himself.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The fun that's enjoyed
                to-day, though, must be enjoyed within doors; for rarely have we had such a spiteful
                conspiracy of the elements against out-door comforts, as on this Christmas day for
                '48. The ground since Friday, has been covered with snow and ice. Last night it
                thawed, and now we have a diabolical mixture of snow, slush, and mud. Over and
                around all spreads the densest of fogs&#8212;more impenetrable than the style of a
                transcendentalist.</p>  
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>All the church bells rang merry peals this morning. The chimes of
                Trinity,<ptr target="med.00989_n7"/> in particular, gave out an especial ding-dong, in honor of the day. (It is
                somewhat singular that they don't get some fit and proper player upon those chimes.
                We are heartily tired of hearing nothing but an octave run up, and then run
                down&#8212;Sunday after Sunday.).....Of course, with such weather, the ladies can't go
                out; and just as of course, the streets and churches are uninviting, and the sitting
                rooms and parlors doubly attractive....A number of balls are forthcoming during the
                current week. At one of them, that of the "Northern Light Association," Martin Van
                Buren<ptr target="med.00989_n2"/> is to be present. He and "Prince John"<ptr target="med.00989_n3"/> are 
                in town; ditto Wm. H. Seward.<ptr target="med.00989_n8"/> The
                latter is pushed by his friends for the U.S. Senatorship. Fillmore<ptr target="med.00989_n4"/> is understood to
                be against him. The whigs<ptr target="med.00961_n4"/> are quarrelling like the mischief over this and other
                "spoils."</p>   
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The California gold excitement<ptr target="med.00984_n10"/> still rages, and, like most potent
                maladies, it has swallowed up lesser ones, such as the Cholera,<ptr target="med.00989_n5"/> the influenza, and
                so forth....A horrid murder, of which the papers will give full particulars, was
                committed in Walnut street, last Friday: the victims, thus far, are two Germans&#8212;the
                woman, Maria Kloster,<ptr target="med.00989_n6"/> not being dead yet.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>....We have also had a little breeze, from
                the attempted abduction, in broad day, and in one of our most public streets, of a
                young man, a mulatto, who was claimed as his property, by a person named Lee.<ptr target="n5001"/> The
                latter engaged a couple of men to do the job, and promised them &#36;200 for it. They
                may get the dollars&#8212;but it is quite likely they will get a short residence in the
                State Prison, too; as the offence of abduction is a felony here.</p>
