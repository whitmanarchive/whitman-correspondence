         <p>I<ptr target="yal.00090_n100"/> am in great trouble again and of course must write to you about it.  I was in Washington the 2nd and I went to No 34 4 ½ Street and pawned my Watch a good American Lever, for $22.07 which I was to pay within a month but I was robbed of my pocket Book which contained a receipt which he gave me for the wach  now I want you to go there if you will and see the man (I dont know his name) and if the thief has not already been there and got the wach I want you to tell him not to let any one have it on that receipt.  I will soon be there myself and redeem it for I am going to be discharged within a few days when I will come and see you.  You will confer a great favor on me by going at once to see about it.  I would like to have the fellow arrested if he should bring the ticket for the Wach for I had another Stole from me at the same time.  Write to me as soon as you find out about the Wach for I am very anxious about it.  I dont want to loose both Waches  I have written this in a great hurry.  write to me soon from your good friend</p>
            <p>It is No 34 4 ½ St.</p>
