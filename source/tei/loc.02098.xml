                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I have had it in my mind, concerning Leaves of Grass, to tell you a tale which will
                perhaps afford you a quiet moment's amusement now while you are preparing Autumn
                Boughs<ptr target="loc.02098_n1"/> for us.</p>
            <p>Many years ago, probably about 1871, when the first enthusiasm for your wonderful
                book was on me;&#8212;the first &#38; last enthusiasm, I should say, for it has
                endured uninterruptedly,&#8212;I was at the home of George Hry. Lewes &#38;<ptr target="loc.02178_n4"/> "George
                    Eliot,"<ptr target="n3044"/> &#38; was enjoying one of those short earnest
                t&#234;te-a-t&#234;te's that she found means to accord somehow to each of her room
                full of visitors.</p>
            <p>I asked her what she thought of L. of G.; &#38; Lewes, coming up at the moment,
                remarked in his flippant way, "Let me see, the author wrote Heel-taps, didn't he?"
                Letting this poor jest pass, I pursued the serious talk with G. E.&#8212;found she
                knew hardly anything of L. of G., &#38; urged her to read it. She said she had
                glanced at it but was impressed that it had "no message for her soul". I ventured a
                respectful demurrer &#38; made way for the next t&#234;te-a-t&#234;te-ist. A few
                weeks afterwards, she sent me by young Lewes, who was then an official<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02098.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> colleague of
                mine, a handsome and characteristic message. She had been <hi rend="underline">reading</hi> Leaves of Grass;
                had found that the book <hi rend="underline">had</hi> a "message for her soul" &#38;
                thanked me for the part I had taken in pressing on her attention its scope, meaning,
                and original force. I do not pretend to quote her words except those in inverted
                commas. The rest were only reported to me by a tolerably <unclear reason="illegible"
                    resp="#aa" cert="low">inaccurate</unclear> young man; but the drift was
                certainly as given above.</p>
            <p>Now I have often thought she must have made some such acknowledgment to you
                direct&#8212;seldom as she wrote to anyone in those "Priory" days. Did she or did
                she not?</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Always, dear Walt Whitman</salute>
                <salute>most sincerely yours,</salute>
                <signed>H. Buxton Forman.</signed>
            </closer>
               <note type="editorial" place="bottom" resp="#unk">Forman put on margin above head of letter: "Excuse the unreadableness of a scrawl
                    written in the only available &#188; hour of the day, on the underground
                    railway, with that most hateful of modern inventions a stylographic pen."
