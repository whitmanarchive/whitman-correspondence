                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I write this in Dr's<ptr target="n0119"/> office<ptr target="loc.04383_n3"/>&#8212;(3. 10 pm) 
             Dr.  busy&#8212;asks me to give you his love. Day gloriously fine&#8212;warm 
             as one of our hottest Midsummer days.&#8212;We are going
             to drive soon to the cricket ground here (in front of Refractory Wards) to 
             watch a cricket match for a short time. Much cooler to 
             <hi rend="underline">watch</hi> it than to take part in it!</p>
            <p>I was very proud &#38; happy this morning to receive your letter of 
            the 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr target="loc.04386_n2"/>
            &#38; the batch of papers you sent me. Thank you from my heart. 
            It stirs me very deeply that you should
            trouble to write in your present circumstances, &#38; nothing 
            that you have ever done seems more characteristic of the love which 
            your whole life exemplifies. Love to you in return&#8212;deep &#38; tender
            &#38; lifelong.</p>
            <p>And thank you for your advice (to "tie up" &#38;c) so full of tender 
            sympathy &#38; kindness.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am glad that you "continue same as before" which means really&#8212;as 
            you say&#8212;"thankful it's no worse"
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00918_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            I understand well that <hi rend="underline">at best</hi> it is "bad enough." I could wish it
            were otherwise if I were not convinced that a divine purpose underlies it all. It seems to be your
            lot&#8212;as Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> says&#8212;to teach us not only to live, but how to suffer &#38; to die.
            That there "is all fullness to reward you," I do not doubt,&#8212;to 
            reward <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, personally&#8212;As for <hi rend="underline">us</hi>, well, our loving sympathy only goes out to you
            all the more deeply &#38; tenderly.&#8212;And all future generations of your lovers
            will think of you with "more tender love.&#8212;
            </p>
            <p>I thank you for Ernest Rhys's<ptr target="n4152"/> letter,<ptr target="n5005"/> &#38; will write to 
             him on my return.</p>
            <p>Since I began this Dr. &#38; I have had a drive together to the Cricket 
             Ground&#8212;staying there about 10 minutes&#8212;match between 
             "Doctors V Lawyers"&#8212;D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi>
                just out for about 147 runs&#8212;Dr. Beemer<ptr target="loc.07330_n2"/>
                scoring over 60.</p>
            <p>Mail just come in with 3 English letters for me&#8212;Father,<ptr target="n6121b"/> D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J,<ptr target="n4102"/> &#38;
                RK Greenhalgh.<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> Letters never tasted so good to me as they do now!</p>
            <p>Am impatient to read them, &#38; will close. Please give my love to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi>
                Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &#38; to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/>&#8212;&#38; to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/>
                &#38; his wife.<ptr target="loc.04797_n8"/> With supreme love to
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi> &#38; constant thoughts &#38; good wishes</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>

                <p>PS/ Letter from father<ptr target="n5001"/> tells me of two magazines received from you&#8212;Thanks! Letter from
                    RKG on Sep 9&#8212;supposes that I saw you that 
                    day&#8212;&#38; says. "I feel the hour sacred
                    &#38; sweet, for I am sure today has seen the communion of two souls, both dear 
                    as life to me &#38;c." Sends love to you.</p>
