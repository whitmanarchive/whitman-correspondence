            <p><hi rend="underline">Now</hi>, the "situation" is as follows. I had by far <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="7" unit="chars"/> or larger <hi rend="underline">wheat crop</hi> than <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> before—a <unclear reason="damage" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">little</unclear> <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="7" unit="chars"/> of <hi rend="underline">good oats</hi>—the little <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> <hi rend="underline">cotton</hi>, on <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="10" unit="chars"/> (most of it) than I usually plant, <unclear reason="damage" resp="#nhg" cert="low">proving</unclear> tolerably well—"rust" beginning now (rust <gap reason="damage" extent="2 word" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> ate). On all poor lands about me, <hi rend="underline">cotton</hi> started off very slowly, but since the end of an <hi rend="underline">unprecedented</hi> <choice><orig>drouth</orig><reg>drought</reg></choice> lasting through May, the "season" <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> been, right about me, <hi rend="underline">absolute</hi> <hi rend="underline">perfection</hi> and the cotton <hi rend="underline">couldn't help</hi> climbing and climbing till it has got to a pretty respectable size. Then as to my <hi rend="underline">corn</hi>, planted on very much "spotted" ground, upon taking a "first-day loaf" with a neighbor, a week ago, I felt bound to say this corn with nearly every stalk bearing either a big ear or a good-sized "nubbin" <hi rend="underline">speaks volumes for the season</hi>—Maybe it would have done you good to be there and hear how the Philosopher can "swagger" and <hi rend="underline">descant</hi> and <hi rend="underline">crow</hi> on fitting occasions. (However, it may be you are destined as <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> mode of <hi rend="underline">punishments for your "sins"</hi>, never to enjoy "true Free Will" by getting to enjoy <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="10" unit="chars"/> and be with <hi rend="underline">the</hi> P—rather than take <hi rend="underline">second choice</hi> and suffer banishment in outer darkness.) The land being mostly poor, I am surprised at the crop—I never have made a crop with so little of plowing after planting. Indeed <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> for 3 years past have helped as to make cultivation easy, I have had fine <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> to practise <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> only sin of <hi rend="underline">resting too much</hi>.</p>

            <p>I think I had better stop my <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="12" unit="chars"/> off the <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="6" unit="chars"/> you some facts of my spiritual or "religious" experience. <hi rend="underline">Then</hi>—<gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> thou this, I <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> not "taken in hand" and "indoctrinated" with ideas about "God" &amp;c. <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> so early as most children. I remember well, I was beginning to <hi rend="underline">walk two miles</hi> to <hi rend="underline">school</hi> before the first person (the <hi rend="underline">schoolmaster</hi>) put into my head the thought that the "world" was either <hi rend="underline">made</hi> or <hi rend="underline">needed</hi> to be made. I had accepted naturally, "<hi rend="underline">normally</hi>", the self-existence and eternity of <hi rend="underline">things</hi>. Of course, old people got me to accepting their "tales", but I never have been "orthodox"—have never after the common fashion said "maker" or "master" or "Creator" or "blessed Savior" or "Savior" or "the savior" or "holy Sabbath" &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c I never felt that I had sinned against God, nor was "sorry".☞ <hi rend="underline">They scared me tho'</hi>, and made me think "God" would rather do so than not—to "play the Devil with" <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. At 20 years of age, impressed by their falsehoods about <hi rend="underline">experimental</hi> religion; in a time when there was no "revival", nor excitement, urgency, or favor or shield of nights <choice><sic>darknes</sic><corr>darkness</corr></choice>, <hi rend="underline">the Philosopher</hi> walked up before a crowd, solitarily, and with a brave and yet reverential calmness, and joined the Methodist church "as a Seeker". I think I may say I challenged (with sufficient humbleness or modesty) God, Christ, and the Saints to ☞ fight <gap reason="damage" extent="one word" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> a fair fight.</p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02402.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
            <p>The result was that whereas I had been a <unclear reason="damage" cert="high" resp="#ab">little</unclear> "blind", I soon began to "see" a good deal more than I had been seeing. Palpably, the saints thought we can't do much at "<unclear reason="damage" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">casting</unclear> out" the sort of calm, critical, <hi rend="underline">healthy</hi>, <hi rend="underline">philosophical</hi> "Devils". What a fall was there my countrymen!—</p>
            
            <p>The subject <unclear reason="damage" cert="low" resp="#nhg">has</unclear> been a life-time study with me, and I <unclear reason="damage" cert="high" resp="#ab">would</unclear> have you know that at about 39 years I "got off the fence" on the Robert Ingersoll side of the question.<ptr target="n0839"/> (I dont admire <hi rend="underline">him</hi> boundlessly—his fancy and his tongue seem to run away with him.)</p>
            
            <p>My personal experience in childhood, then, enables me to "see through" the claim that religious ideas are "innate"—they are not. ☞ If the population of the world were divided into <hi rend="underline">lots</hi> of ten thousand—separated—minds a blank on the subject—and <hi rend="underline">one</hi> person in each <hi rend="underline">lot</hi> should think and say "<hi rend="underline">perhaps</hi> the world" was "created", the others would be able to hear in time and accept the <hi rend="underline">fact</hi> that <hi rend="underline">perhaps &amp;c &amp;c</hi></p>
