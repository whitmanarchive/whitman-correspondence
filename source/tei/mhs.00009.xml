            <p>Your letter came this morning, &amp; not until we got it could we believe in the change&#8212;so different from what we supposed 
                the <choice><orig>programme</orig><reg>program</reg></choice> was arranged to be, in <name >St Louis</name>, housekeeping &amp;c. Dear Hattie, it is real lonesome here since you went away&#8212;<ptr target="mhs.00009_n1"/>it is more a "receiving vault" to me than ever. Thank God though I am certainly better this winter, &amp; more like 
                a prospect for me physically, than for now nearly four years. (It will be now four years the 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of January, since 
                I was paralyzed) This makes me more cheerful &amp; buoyant under the chilling atmosphere, (both moral &amp; meteorological) 
                of this house. Dear girls, I sometimes lately feel as if I was going out in the world, to take some hand again in some 
                work that suits me, even if ever so little. Wouldn't it be a blessed thing?&#8212;You see dear girls I just talk freely 
                &amp; confidentially to you both&#8212;I want some one <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="mhs.00009.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>to talk to&#8212;&amp; it does me good&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Hattie, I have just got your pictures (after some delay) from the photographic printers.<ptr target="mhs.00009_n2"/> I will send you one <hi rend="underline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">soon</hi>&#8212;&amp; will send your father one, 
                &amp; your Aunt Hannah at Burlington wants one. Your Aunt Lou has one in the parlor already, &amp; it looks very nice&#8212;it is 
                a plain head only, looks like an engraving, no fixings or bows or jewelry, but a simple fine classical head, just as I 
                wanted it&#8212;But you will see when I send it you.
            </p>
            
            <p>Your Uncle George, Aunt Lou &amp; Cousin Eddy are all well as usual. Tip<ptr target="mhs.00009_n3"/> is also well as usual&#8212;It has been &amp; is very cold here&#8212;the ground 
                is all covered with snow&#8212;but it is bright to-day. I have just been out about three blocks off in an alley, to see 
                a poor young man James Davis,<ptr target="mhs.00009_n4"/> who is dying of consumption&#8212;You know I like to visit the sick&#8212;I have to stay in most 
                of the time just now though, as it is very slippery&#8212;Little Helen Ewing is staying here now&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>If I keep as well as now I think of going on to New York on a visit next month. Lou will write to you soon.</p>
