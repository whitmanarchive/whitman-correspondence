                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your p.c. of yesterday came at breakfast time.<ptr target="loc.02953_n1"/> I often wish that I <hi
                    rend="underline">could</hi> write you a long letter, &#38; tell you all about
                us, but as I wrote you, my head &#38; eyes <hi rend="underline">gave out</hi>, &#38;
                I can write but very little, even to my two sisters,&#8212; &#38; we are all that
                are left of the family of nine, seven children &#38; the father &#38; mother. But
                one <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02953.002.jpg" type="verso"/> night last week I
                had a most vivid dream of you, &#38; thought I should write that day, but the many
                duties that came each day prevented it. I am sorry that I have not better news to
                give you of William.<ptr target="n2002"/> He has failed very much in the last six weeks, indeed I date
                the marked change for the worse from the paralysis of the eye lid, &#38; that was
                the last of Sept., but a very marked change for the worse since <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02953.003.jpg" type="recto"/> Nov. 23d. No one is as
                well aware of it as I am, for I see him at his worst, as well as his best. I am his
                sole &#38; only nurse, &#38; help to dress, undress &#38; bathe him, &#38; he is
                under no restraint to say how he <hi rend="underline">always</hi> puts the best face
                on things to every one, &#38; is always ready to joke about himself, &#38; often
                makes me laugh when I am ready to cry. But now he often debates whether he shall <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02953.004.jpg" type="verso"/> go out at all, &#38;
                does not go till 11 or 10:30 A.M. &#38; sometimes later. He, until very lately,
                would almost resent the idea of staying at home when I suggested it,&#8212;but
                locomotion is becoming more &#38; more labored, &#38; when I am helping him to get
                up &#38; down, I have sometimes wondered if I shall be able to lift him more &#38;
                more, as he is less able to lift himself, as he weighs 200 or more &#38; I 105.
                Until lately, too, he has had the most wonderful courage, &#38; would <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02953.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <hi rend="underline">not</hi> give up, but it is not so all the time now. Still,
                there is one thing in his favor, (if one so regards it) &#38; that is that he is
                still <hi rend="underline">determined</hi> to live, I never saw such clinging to <hi
                    rend="underline">this life</hi>, in any one; &#38; he still feels that if
                the right doctor could be found that he could be made entirely well. He counted up
                the other day, &#38; found that he had had <hi rend="underline">fifteen</hi>
                doctors. Besides the "<hi rend="underline">paresis</hi>" he suffers from
                inconveniences of various <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02953.006.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> other kinds, which follow from his not being able to reach the
                water closet in time. Then he has had inflammation, some time ago, in one, &#38;
                then the other <hi rend="underline">toe</hi>, lately the second finger of the right
                hand, was very bad, &#38; is not wholly well yet. I look at him &#38; wonder how any
                one can want to live who suffers so; the body seems to me such a <hi
                    rend="underline">prison</hi> under these conditions. But his deepest unhappiness
                now is that he has not yet been able to <pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc.02953.007.jpg" type="recto"/> get his article published which he wrote
                in defense of Donnelly,<ptr target="n4108"/> &#38; as yet, he has not. He put life
                &#38; energy into it, &#38; said if he could only get to New York he could get it
                into the right magazine.</p>
            <p>We are always glad of a word from you, &#38; hope that you are on the gain in earnest
                now. I need not tell you that the long strain of anxiety &#38; care has told deeply on
                me,&#8212;but I have <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02953.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
                been upheld so far, &#38; have faith &#38; hope still,&#8212;&#38; <hi
                    rend="underline">shall have</hi>, <hi rend="underline">no matter what
                    comes.</hi></p>
