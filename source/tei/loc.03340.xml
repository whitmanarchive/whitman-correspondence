                Transcendentalism to a notable degree, &amp; is always wishing to grasp the impossible.
                However the philosophy of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> has well been wholly
                lost on him; &amp; the late adventure of Wales has had richly human results in many
                ways.

                I believe I last
                wrote to you from Carmarthen, where I stayed with my dear grand-parents, making
                excursions far &amp; wide,&#8212;to all the old castles &amp; pleasant sea-slopes &amp;
                hill-crests within reach.<ptr target="loc.03340_n2"/> There one day, standing on Merlin's Hill,</p>

           <p>&amp; looking to the sea on one
                side, &amp; to the Llyn-y-fan region (where I stayed last year) on the other, a new sense of human
                destiny, &amp; of the epic continuity from old Wales to new America in the history of
                races, came upon me. Which Art &amp; Time may yet keep me to 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r"

                thoughts, (as I dropped with ready strides down those Welsh mountains at nightfall,
                or arm-in-arm with my Grandfather listened to his stories of his youth,) used to
                come from time to time, quickening me out of the ruts of literary convention &amp;
                routine.</p> 
            <p>From Carmarthen, on to Swansea,&#8212;a seaport town! Here I stayed with a bright
                young fellow at his seaside cot at the Mumbles,&#8212;a picturesque village amid
                curious cliffs. Here too I lectured,&#8212;on Bohemian London, &amp; went through a
                round of feastings &amp; jollifications. (I am just posting an article or two on Swansea
                to a London paper, copy of which shall be sent you when the thing is in print).</p>

            <p>No doubt you have had some account of this delightful country place from me before.
                Here my Uncle Percival,<ptr target="loc.03340_n3"/> who is a Naturalist &amp; Poultry-fancier, among other things,
                has a house almost ideal in its way&#8212;the old-fashioned English way! I wish you
                could see it. The house stands amid great lawns &amp; gardens on the slopes of the Vale
                of Avallon, with Glastonbury Tor in the distance rising up mysteriously, capped by a
                solitary old tower. I am just about to set off to climb it, and as I stand there
                shall remember to wing yet another shaft of imagination to you sitting solitary
                perchance in Mickle St.! With all desires, that you may have poet's thoughts still
                to drive off pain, &amp; indeed everything that you yourself desire!&#8212;</p>
