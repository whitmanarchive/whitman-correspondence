            <p>I had read <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">thy</unclear> sublime poem <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">of</unclear> the "Universal" once and again, and yet again&#8212;seeing it in the Graphic, Post, Mail, World, and among other papers.<space extent="10 letters"/>It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> sublime.<space extent="10 letters"/>It raised my mind to its own sublimity.<space extent="10 letters"/>It seems to me the sublimest of all your poems.<space extent="10 letters"/>I cannot help reading it every once of a while.<space extent="10 letters"/>I return to it as a fountain of joy</p>
            <p>My beloved Walt.&#8212;You know how I have worshipped you, without change or cessation, for twenty years.<space extent="10 letters"/>While my <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">soul</unclear> Exists, the worship must be Ever new.</p>
            <p>It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition the "Leaves of Grass" <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">that I</unclear> saw a copy of it at at a newspaper stand in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">Fulton</unclear> street Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al"> felt that there</unclear> was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into me.</p>
            <p>&#8212;I expected certainly to go down to Camden last fall to see you.<space extent="6 letters"/>But something prevented. And, in time, I saw in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">the poems that just hard reward</unclear>.</p>
            <p>&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">In New Year</unclear> took me with a new friend of action among the miserables.<space extent="6 letters"/>Oh, what scenes of human horror were to be found in this city <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">last winter</unclear>.</p>
            <p>&#8212;I cannot tell you how much I was engaged, or all I did for <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">twelve months</unclear>.<space extent="6 letters"/>I <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">must</unclear> wait till I see you to tell you about these <choice><sic>story's</sic><corr>stories</corr></choice>story's.<space extent="10 letters"/> I have

            been going toward social radicalism of later years, and appeared more of the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">Academy</unclear> of <gap reason="illegible"/> lately on <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Primort</unclear> and oratoring the <gap reason="illegbile"/> meeting. <space extent="10 letters"/>How I would like to see you, in order to temper my <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">heat</unclear>, and expand my <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">narrowness</unclear></p>
            <p>How absurd it is to suppose that there is <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">any interest</unclear> in the brain of a man who can generate the poems of The "Universal"<space extent="10 letters"/>I would <gap reason="illegible" extent="two words"/> and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">say</unclear> that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">same</unclear> kind of ailment <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">ought to spread</unclear>.</p>
            <p>My beloved Walt&#8212;Tell me if you would like me to come to see you, and heretofor I can do so within a few weeks.</p>
