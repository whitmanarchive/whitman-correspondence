            <p>Are you well and happy and enjoying this beautiful summer? London is, in one sense, 
                a sort of big prison at this time of year: but still at a wide open window with the 
                blue sky opening to me too &amp; a soft breeze blowing 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.00238.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                in &amp; the Book that is so dear—my life-giving treasure—open on 
                my lap. I have very happy times. No one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy 
                in these poems than I—breathe the fresh sweet exhilarating air of them, bathe 
                in it, drink in what nourishes &amp; delights the whole being, body intellect &amp; 
                soul, more than I. Nor could you, when 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00239.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                writing them have desired to come nearer to a human being &amp; be more to them for 
                ever &amp; for ever than you are &amp; will be to me. O I take the hand you stretch out 
                each day—I put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment: I ask nothing more 
                of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that companionship, that includes 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00236.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                all.</p>
            <p><date when="1874-07-06">6th.</date> This very morning has come the answer to my 
                question—First I only saw the Poem—read it so elate—soared with 
                it to joyous heights—said to myself—he is so well again, he is able to take 
                the journey into Massachusetts &amp; speak the kindling words—Then I turned 
                over and my joy was dashed. My Darling! such patience yet needed along the tedious 
                path! Oh it makes me long with 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_cb.00242.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                passionate longing, with yearnings I know not how to bear, to come, to be your loving 
                cheerful companion, the one to take such care, to do all for you, to beguile the time, 
                to give you of my health as you have done to tens of thousands. I do not doubt either, 
                but that you will get well. I feel sure, sure it will be given me to see you And perhaps
                a very slow, gradual recovery<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> is safest is the only way in this as in other matters, to 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_cb.00244.jpg" type="verso"/>
                thoroughness &amp; a very speedy rally would be specious, treacherous in the end, 
                leading you to do what you were not yet fit for. I believe if I could only make you 
                conscious of the love, the enfolding love my heart breathes out toward you, it would 
                do you physical good. Many sided love—Mothers love that cherishes, that delights 
                so in personal service that sees in sickness &amp; suffering such dear appeals to 
                an answer<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_cb.00245.jpg" type="recto"/>ing 
                limitless tenderness:—wife's love—ah you draw that from me too, resistlessly—I 
                have no choice—Comrades love, so happy in sharing all, pain, sorrow, toil, effort, 
                enjoyments, thoughts hopes, aims, struggles, disappointment, beliefs, aspirations. Childs 
                love too that trusts utterly, confides unquestioningly.—Not more spontaneously &amp; 
                wholly without effort or volition on my part, does the sunlight flow into my eyes when I 
                open them in the morning 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_cb.00241.jpg" type="verso"/>
                than does the sense of your existence enter like bright light into my awaking soul. And 
                then I send to you thoughts—tender, caressing thoughts—that would fain nestle 
                so close—ah, if you could feel them, take them in, let them lie in your breast, each 
                morning.</p>
            <p>My children are all well, dear Friend. Herbert<ptr target="n0262"/> is going to spend 
                his holidays with his brother<ptr target="n2000"/> in Wales—&amp; we shall all 
                go to Colne as usual the end of this month, &amp; remain there through August and September 
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_cb.00248.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                so if you think of it, address any paper you may send Earls Colne, Halstead, because 
                I should get it a day sooner. But it does not signify if you forget &amp; send it here; 
                it will be forwarded all right. Beatrice<ptr target="n0260"/> has just got through 
                one of the Govern: Exams, in elementary mathematics and I hope Herby has got into the 
                Academy, but do not know for certain yet. He works away zealously and with great delight 
                in his work. William

                Rossetti and his wife<ptr target="loc.02877_n4"/> are coming to dine with us Wednesday—they 
                look so well &amp; happy it does one good to see them. The Conways<ptr target="n0170"/> are 
                going to Ostend I think for their holiday, &amp; when they come back 
                going to move into a larger house. I heard an American lady, Miss 
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#me">Whinery</unclear><ptr target="n5001"/> 
                sing at a concert the other day, who delighted me, fascinated me—I longed to kiss
                <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc_cb.00251.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                her after each song, though some of them were poor enough Verdi<ptr target="loc.02877_n8"/> stuff—but she contrived 
                to impart genuineness &amp; beauty to them. I hope you will hear her when she returns to America, 
                which will be soon I believe.</p>
            <p>Good bye, dearest Friend—Beatrice Herby &amp; Grace<ptr target="n0261"/> join
                their love with mine. I had the sweet little Bridal Poem all safe, &amp; by the bye I
