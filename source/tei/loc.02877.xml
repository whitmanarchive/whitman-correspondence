            <p>Are you well and happy and enjoying this beautiful summer? London is, in one sense, a
                sort of big prison at this time of year: but still at a wide open window with the
                blue sky opening to me &amp; a soft breeze blowing <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02877.002.jpg" type="verso"/> in &amp; the Book that is so
                dear&#8212;my life–giving treasure&#8212;open on my lap. I have very happy
                times. No one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy in these poems than
                I&#8212;breathe the fresh sweet exhilarating air of them, bathe in it, drink in what
                nourishes &amp; delights the whole being, body intellect &amp; soul, more than I.
                Nor could you, when <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02877.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                writing them have desired to come nearer to a human being &amp; be more to them for
                ever &amp; for ever than you are &amp; will be to me. O I take the hand you stretch
                out each day&#8212;I put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment: I ask
                nothing more of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that companionship
                that includes <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02877.004.jpg" type="verso"/> all. </p>
            <p><date when="1874-07-06" rend="right">6th.</date> This
                very morning has come the <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">answer</supplied> to my question&#8212;First I only saw the Poem&#8212;read it
                so elate&#8212; soared with it to joyous heights, said to myself&#8212;he is so
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">well
                    again,</supplied> he is able to take the journey <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">into Massachusetts</supplied> &amp; speak the
                kindling words&#8212;Then I turned over and my joy was dashed. My Darling! such
                patience yet needed along the tedious path! Oh, it <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">makes me long</supplied> with <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02877.005.jpg" type="recto"/> passionate <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">longings,</supplied> with
                yearnings I know not how to bear, to come, <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">to be your</supplied> loving, cheerful companion,
                the one to take such <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">care, to do</supplied> all for you, to beguile the time, to give you of my
                health as you have done to tens of thousands. I do not doubt either, but that you
                will get well. I feel sure, sure it <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">will be</supplied> given me to see you And perhaps
                a very slow, gradual recovery is safest is the only way in <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">this as</supplied> in other

                of the love, the enfolding love my <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">heart</supplied> breathes out toward you, it

                sharing all, pain, sorrow, toil, effort, enjoyments, thoughts, hopes, aims,
                struggles, disappointment, beliefs, aspirations. Childs love too that trusts
                utterly, confides unquestioningly.&#8212;Not more spontaneously &amp; wholly without
                effort or volition on my part, does the sunlight flow into my eyes when I open them
                in the morning <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02877.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
