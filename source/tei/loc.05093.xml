                <p>Your postals came "OK" and found me pretty well. Was glad to hear from you, even though it was through a postal: as you know, I am down on that kind of business and never pay any attention to them only from you, but it pleases me now to even get that much from an old friend. As I have told you the position I now have is not a desirable one but better than nothing. Have only saw Dr. Bucke once since he came home, that is privately, and that was the day after he arrived. He then said he would by and get something better for me. Will remain

                    here until we find the prospects and if nothing better promises will go to Detroit and from there to Chicago. I am <hi rend="underline">determined</hi> to make a hit somewhere and <choice><abbr>dont</abbr><expan>don't</expan></choice> forget it. I havent had a blue spell yet and think I can get along without any. By the time I receive this months pay I will be in <hi rend="underline">easy <choice><abbr>circum</abbr><expan>circumstances</expan></choice></hi>, financially and will decide on a turn and let you know. I think I can manage to get pretty well over the <choice><abbr>N.Y.</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice> and Canada by working here and there. I love to travel and see. We have a deep snow here, fell a week ago. Haven't heard from home directly but once since my arrival. With lots of love and a good old time kiss I am ever your boy</p>
