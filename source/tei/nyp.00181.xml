               <salute>Dear comrade,<ptr target="nyp.00181_n100"/>
            </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have not heard from you for some time, Lewy Brown has received two letters from you, &amp; Walter<ptr target="nyp.00181_n3"/> in Ward E has received one three weeks ago. I wrote you a letter about a week ago, which I hope you have received. I was sorry you did not come up to my room to get the shirt &amp; other things you promised to accept from me and take when you went away. I got them all ready, a good strong blue shirt, a pair of drawers &amp; socks, and it would have been a satisfaction to me if you had accepted them. I should have often thought now Tom may be wearing around his body something from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, &amp; that it might contribute to your comfort, down there in camp on picket, or sleeping in your tent.</p>
            <p>Lewy Brown and Hiram are about the same. I saw Lewy &amp; sat with him last evening. I go to see him almost every evening. He sets up a little in the chair, during the middle of the day&#8212;his foot is doing pretty well. There is quite a time at Armory about Dr. Bliss<ptr target="nyp.00181_n4"/>&#8212;some say he is under arrest for defrauding the government. There is a new surgeon in charge&#8212;I have not seen him. In Ward K there is a new surgeon, Dr. Rose.<ptr target="nyp.00181_n5"/> There is quite a change, with men &amp; doctors, going and coming.</p>
            <p>Well, Tom, how did you stand the gay old rain storm of Thursday &amp; Friday last?<ptr target="nyp.00181_n6"/> It rained here enough to wet hell itself, and swamp the fires. But yesterday &amp; to-day here have been fine. The talk here previously was all about Hooker's advance&#8212;we expected a big fight, on the jump&#8212;but of course the storm has laid an injunction on that for some days.</p>
            <p>Yet I suppose Hooker must move soon, &amp; that there will be fighting and lots of marches and skirmishes, &amp;c before the summer is through. O my dear comrade &amp; brother, I hope it will prove your good luck to come safe through all the engagements &amp; marches of this war, &amp; that we shall meet again, not to part. I hope this letter will find you in good health &amp; spirits.</p>
            <p>Tom, I will not write a long yarn at present. I guess I have not made out much of a letter, anyhow at present, but I will let it go, whatever it is, hoping it may please you, coming from old wooly-neck, who loves you. You must let that make up for all deficiencies now and to come. Not a day passes, nor a night but I think of you. Now, my dearest comrade, I will bid you <hi rend="italic">so long</hi>, &amp; hope God will put it in your heart to bear toward me a little at least of the feeling I have about you. If it is only a quarter as much I shall be satisfied.</p>
            <p>Your faithful friend &amp; brother,</p>

         <postscript>
            <p>Tom, it is now about 9 o'clock, a fine moonlight night. I am going to close this up, and then scud out for a walk to the post office. Good by again, &amp; God bless you, dear brother.</p>
