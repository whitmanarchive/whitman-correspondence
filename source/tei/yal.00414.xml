        <salute>Dearest mother<ptr target="n0705"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have had one or two quite good spells—but am not feeling well just now—have
        got over to the office, &amp; am now sitting at my desk—it is a rainy day here, not
        very cool—Mother, I have nothing particular to write to-day either—but thought I
        would send just a few lines, as you might like to get something—The season is quite
        advanced here—pleasant the past few days, I have been out in the cars every day. I
        have not written very lately either to Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/> or Hannah<ptr target="n0285"/>—</p>

      <p>Well, Mammy dear, how are you getting along at Camden<ptr target="yal.00414_n1"/>—&amp; how are Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> and George<ptr target="n0700"/>—I often wish you were here,
        mother dear, as it would be such a relief to me to have you where I could see you, &amp;
        talk a while—I think there is no doubt that, take the time right through, I gain
        steadily, though very slowly indeed—but I get many tedious spells, both of head &amp;
        limbs—there seems to be great deal of paralysis—I hear, or read of cases, every
        day—One man here to-day told me of his father, who had a very bad stroke at 70 years
        of age, but got over it after all, and lived 17 or 18 years after, by great care—So I
        hear of many cases, some good, some unfavorable—</p>

      <p>As to myself, I do not lose faith for a moment, in my ultimate recovery—though, as I
        said, I have some bad hours—sometimes very bad—Well, mama dear, I have scribbled
        out this sheet nearly, such as it is—I sent you a letter last Monday<ptr target="yal.00414_n2"/>—I have changed the address on the envelopes to you, mother,
        as you see<ptr target="yal.00414_n3"/>—is it right?—I am feeling better—my
        head is some easier—Love to you, dear mama, &amp; all—</p>
