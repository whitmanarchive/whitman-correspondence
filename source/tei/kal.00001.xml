            <p>Do you know much about the half-profit system of publication? My publishers still
                stick to me for a book &#38; say that if I am not content with the usual 10 per
                cent, they will publish on 1/2 profit basis. I don't know which is best, since the
                figuring is with them.</p>

                stroke. He had said to me in the summer that he hoped to go in that way I know it is
                best it should be so, but I find it impossible to reason myself out of a sense of
                deepest loss. How desolate now does the old home look to me in the <unclear
