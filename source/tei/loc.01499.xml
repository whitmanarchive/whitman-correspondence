                <salute>My dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Some days ago came my parcel&#8212;many thanks&#8212;Mr. Grosart's<ptr target="n0279"/>
                books included. That for Mr. Graves<ptr target="loc.01499_n5"/> had come previously&#8212;I have waited a few
                days expecting to hear from my brother<ptr target="n0200"/> (from Edinburgh) of the arrival of his
                copies, but it is sometimes his way to put off writing to me too long, &#38; I have
                little doubt he has got the books safely.</p>
            <p>Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> let me know from time to time any news of you that
                reached him, and I have to thank you for some newspapers now &#38; again.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01499.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
            <p>It was a real sorrow to us, dear friend, to hear of the loss of your little nephew
            &#38; name–sake.<ptr target="n0712"/> A friend of mine Harold Littledale<ptr target="loc.01499_n4"/> watched
                this summer by the side of a little sister (about twenty years younger than himself)
                who died, and he told me that in the presence of death &#38; with its consciousness
                enveloping him it was words of yours which expressed the deepest truths of the hour
                &#38; the event. Littledale is President this year of our principal society of students&#8212;in
                Trinity College, the Philosophical Society, &#38; I believe his Opening address,
                which is the event of the <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01499.005_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> Session, is to be partly concerned with your poetry. It was a
                great satisfaction to me this year also, to get a kind of confession or
                self–revelation from one of the most promising men in my class of the really saving
                &#38; delivering power of your writings when he was lapsing in that lethargy &#38;
                cynicism which is one of the diseases of youth in our <hi rend="underline">Old</hi>
                World, if not in your <hi rend="underline">New</hi> one&#8212;(but in both I <choice>

            <p>I have done too little this last summer. I copied out about 200 <choice>
                    <abbr>pp</abbr>
                    <expan>pages</expan>
                </choice> of verse, &#38; am about to have them published. I will send you a copy,
                but I doubt whether you <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01499.006_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> will care for them&#8212;I don't claim to be an "Answerer"; but I
                do assert a right to be one of the tribe of the singers&#8212;"eye–singer,
                ear-singer, head–singer, sweet–singer, echo–singer, parlor–singer, love–singer, or
                something else".<ptr target="loc.01499_n2"/> And these have their place &#38; <hi
                    rend="underline">raison d'&#234;tre</hi>. Probably my next bit of work will be the
                arranging for publication a volume of Essays on 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                century writers, including Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> &#38; Browning,<ptr
                    target="loc.02966_n4"/> Victor Hugo,<ptr target="n4276"/> &#38; the Westminster
                    Article<ptr target="n0692"/> (somewhat altered) on your poetry.</p>

            <p>You asked for O'Grady's<ptr target="n0453"/> address. I don't know it at this moment;
                but he would like to get your photograph (of which you spoke)<ptr
                    target="loc.01499_n3"/> &#38; if you address it to my care he will get it.</p>

            <p>I hope the cooler weather (after so hot a summer) may do your health good. We are all
                well.</p>
