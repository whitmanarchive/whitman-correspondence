        <salute>Dear son,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I wrote you a letter last Tuesday, 6th, which I suppose you have rec'd. The last I have
        from you was yours of Sunday, 4th. I am still here in Brooklyn, quite busy with the
        printing. I have rec'd a letter from John Rowland who is working for me in the office,
        complaining that he has to work too hard&#8212;I should think by his letter he means to back
        out of his bargain with me&#8212;if so, it will be a bad loss &amp; inconvenience to
        me&#8212;But I shall not fret about it&#8212;whatever happens. It is likely that this will
        shorten my leave, &amp; that I shall have to come back &amp; do my work myself, about the
        end of the month. </p>

      <p>Dear Pete, I hope you are having good times, &amp; are in good spirits. We are having quite
        coolish weather here. The drivers wear their overcoats mornings &amp; evenings. As I sit
        here writing Friday afternoon, it is cloudy &amp; threatens rain. I am going over to New
        York in an hour or so, &amp; shall leave this in the P. O., and then go around
        awhile&#8212;possibly going to Niblo's Theatre<ptr target="n0442"/>, as they play Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"
        to-night, with Davenport &amp; quite a bunch of stars in the piece<ptr target="loc.01531_n2"
        />&#8212;</p>

      <p>Son, I am afraid I shall not make out much of a letter this time&#8212;but you take it so
        hard when I don't write, I thought I would send a few lines&#8212;they would be better than
        nothing&#8212;</p>

      <p>God bless you, my loving boy&#8212;&amp; farewell for this time. </p>
