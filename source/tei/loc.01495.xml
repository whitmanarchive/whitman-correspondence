                <salute>Dear Mr
                    Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Since I wrote last I received a letter from you, acknowledging my <choice>
                    <sic>Shakspeare</sic>
                    <corr><name type="person">Shakspeare</name></corr>
                </choice> book, the <name type="person"><choice>
                        <abbr>E.A.</abbr>
                        <expan>Edward Allen</expan>
                    </choice> Poe</name> newspaper, &amp; that with the lecture on Shakespeare in
                it. Thank you for all. It is very pleasant to think that you remember me.</p>

            <p>The news of your health is that of the chief interest to me. And in one way or
                another I have heard about you several Times. I trust you do not work when you ought
                to rest. For any affection such as yours I should suppose entire rest &amp; open air
                to be essential conditions of recovery; &amp; such lying fallow would be fruitful in
                the End with you.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless I rejoice to hear of the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01495.004.jpg" type="verso"/> Two Rivulets &amp; your Memoranda of the war being ready. I
                enclose a draft or bill on the Bank of England for what they tell me is the
                Equivalent of ten dollars. Would you please send me the new Edition of <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> &amp; Two Rivulets, &amp; Memoranda, but if the Postage is heavy don't
                send the Memoranda, &amp; let that so far compensate you for your loss by postage to
                Ireland. I should like to have my name written in Each book by you. (unless you
                object)&#8212;</p>

            <p>I suppose you have seen Peter Bayne's vicious (&amp; the word is applicable in a
                literary sense as well as an Ethical) article on your writings in The Contemporary
                Review. As to myself I feel that I have a small grievance <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01495.005.jpg" type="recto"/> to complain of&#8212;his selecting
                scraps from my Westminster article, out of connection with their environment, to
                Employ against you as admissions of one who stands on your side. I trust you have
                not so far forgotten my article as to think my meaning was that Attributed to me by
                Peter Bayne. Such an article as this may with some readers delay the understanding
                of your book, but others, as I know, will have their curiosity quickened by it to
                see for themselves what the phenomenon&#8212;<hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                    </choice></hi>&#8212;really is. I see on all sides Tokens of a continuous
                advance in England towards appreciation of your poetry. Occasional references to
                Walt Whitman in reviews &amp; magazine articles now, as a rule, tacitly admit your
                position as secured, instead of being <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01495.006.jpg" type="verso"/> as once was the case, contemptuous. I will send, if I can find
                it, a copy of an article by a young barrister friend of mine, O'Grady<!-- <ptr target="n0453"/> -->, which
                appeared in The Gentleman's magazine the same month in which Peter Bayne's article
                appeared.</p>


            <p>Lately I read a paper on your poems before a Club here&#8212;<hi rend="underline">The
                    Fortnightly Club</hi> &amp; The feeling was, to a degree which surprised me,
                favourable to your writings; &amp; in College I read the same paper to a large class
                of students reading along passages from your <hi rend="underline">Vistas</hi> &amp;
                    <hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G,</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass,</expan>
                    </choice></hi> to which a response of almost involuntary applause was
                given,&#8212;a murmur &amp; low response of satisfaction after complete silence
                &amp; attention.</p>

            <p>I had a pleasant letter from John Burroughs, &amp; got from him <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01495.007.jpg" type="recto"/> a copy of his <hi rend="underline">Winter Sunshine.</hi> This is to me a delightful little book. He is so close to
                nature, yet with such a quick, living human consciousness. His writing has some of
                the wholesome influence upon me that the sunshine, &amp; snow, the apples &amp; the
                birds themselves have: and this is all the more precious to me because my work as
                Professor has a constant tendency to tide me away from what is fresh &amp; vital
                into mere accumulation, &amp; "culture", of a kind which is not life, but mere
                apparatus, machinery, &amp; dead pelf of knowledge.</p>

            <p>Swinburne's "<hi rend="underline">Erechtheus</hi> "the critics here are going into
                fits of admiration about. I am disappointed by it. In comparison with it <hi rend="underline">Atalanta in Calydon</hi> was severe in style; here everything
                is lost &amp; <choice>
                    <orig>engulphed</orig>
                    <reg>engulfed</reg>

                of words. And Browning's new poem,&#8212;in spite of continued loyalty to
                Browning,&#8212; afflicts me by its choice of an unworthy
                subject.<!-- Which work is this? annotation --></p>

            <p>A friend of mine&#8212;Miss West&#8212;has printed a little pamphlet of verses which
                perhaps she may send to you. They are some in sonnet form; &amp; as regards
                executive power very unequal: for prose &amp; not verse is her fine medium of
                expression. The spirit of them is somewhat stern &amp; self repressive; yet a
                capacity for joy is apparent in them; several are occupied with religious doubt,
                &amp; Emotions connected with it; &amp; in the last two or three the result arrived
                at is declared&#8212;a stoical acceptance of our ignorance of the mystery of the
                world; with a certain amount of hope, founded upon the good things of human
                friendship &amp; fellowship which life has revealed to the writer. (I write of what
                you have not seen, &amp; I am not sure that she will think them worth sending to
                you).</p>
