                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Last evening Mr Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> shewed me your post card, from which I
                was extremely sorry to learn that you had been a little uneasy about me. By this
                time you will know from his cablegram and from our letters that all is well with me
                but I regret that I did not write to you sooner or cable to you immediately upon my
                arrival, through not doing so I feel I have been guilty of a seeming lack of
                courtesy to you. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> will need no assurance that this has
                not been inten<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02439.002.jpg" type="verso"/>tional on
                my part; for I can never forget your great kindness to me&#8212;the homely, cordial
                + sponteneous reception you gave me not only to your house but into your heart which
                you seemed fairly to open to me in a way that has touched me very deeply indeed.</p>

            <p>By your loving kindness, your sympathy and your open-handed generosity you have
                enriched my life with treasures which I would not exchange for all the wealth of
                Golconda for you have given me "<hi rend="underline">yourself</hi>" as "a living
                impulse"</p>
            <p>"We convince by our presence." Your presence has haunted me ever since I left you and
                at times the sense of propinquity is so strong that I find it difficult to realize
                that we are separated by more than three thousand miles!</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02439.003.jpg" type="recto"/>


            <p>"What is it then between us? Whatever it is it avails not,&#8212;distance avails not,
                and place avails not."</p>
            <p>The words of Mr Wallace that I seem to have had a spiritual <gap reason="illegible"
                    unit="chars" quantity="10"/> are no exaggeration for I am conscious of having
                received a <hi rend="underline">something</hi> from you which has infused itself
                into my being and which eludes my senses and baffles my judgment to explain.</p>
            <p>And now you crown your goodness by shewing such a sympathetic concern about my
                welfare as no other man save my own, dear, good father could have done.</p>
            <p>For all this and more I desire you to accept of my heartfelt thanks.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02439.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I am glad to hear that your health is fairly good + I trust it may continue to
                improve now that the intensly hot weather has gone.</p>
            <p>I am taking the liberty of writing to Dr Bucke to explain my not visiting him as I
                intended. It was simply impossible for me to do so + deeply do I now regret it.</p>
            <p>I hope Warren has received the book on "massage."</p>
            <p>I send you a few photographs&#8212;the first I have done + hope you will like
                them.</p>
            <p>With kindest regards to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> +
                Warren + love to yourself</p>
