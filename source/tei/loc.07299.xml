            <p>Although you did not enclose Mrs O'C'<hi rend="underline">s</hi><ptr target="n4137"/>
                card with yours of 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.07299_n1"/> (you
                have probably seen the card lying about since you sent the letter) yet I judge from
                the tenor of what you say that your O'C.<ptr target="n2002"/> is very sick. You will
                feel bad about it I know and it is very natural you should still it is my decided
                conviction that we shall be all better off <choice>

                </choice> we get out of our present state than we are at present. And though I would
                gladly see O'Connor well yet (that being out of the question, I fear) the next best
                thing I think will be for him to leave us. Poor fellow! it will only be a very
                little while untill we rejoin him and we will settle then whether the whole thing
                was or was not well planned! I am glad to hear that they are looking up a chair<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/> <pb

                    target="loc.07299_n2"/> If (having a chair) you were living in a cottage with a
                lawn, trees &#38;c &#38;c. and living on the ground floor (as might all be arranged
                well enough) there is no reason why you should not spend a good part of your time
                during the summer in your chair on the grass, under the trees, among the flowers.
                You are not tied to one house (and that about the worst house and the worst situated
                that could be found for you) and there is no reason at all why you should not go
                where you would have the surroundings you need.<ptr target="loc.07299_n3"/> Why not
                get Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> to look about for a good cottage for you? I hope to
                see you before a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> great while</p>
