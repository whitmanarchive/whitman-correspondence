                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was extremely obliged to you for the present of your photograph &#38; books; the 
                <choice><abbr>vol.</abbr><expan>volume</expan></choice> of poems<ptr target="n5002e"/>
                containing (what I now read for the first time in that shape) the important section of 
                <hi rend="underline">Passage to India</hi>,<ptr target="n0465"/> &#38; 
                many modifications here &#38; there in other compositions. It happens that I have lately been compiling a 
                <choice><abbr>vol.</abbr><expan>volume</expan></choice> of selections from 
                American Poets,<ptr target="n0523"/> &#38; I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> had to use your earlier editions for 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01882.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                the purposes of this compilation: but I have now set those aside, &#38; used your new edition throughout&#8212;so the kind &#38; 
                welcome gift came to me at a very apposite moment. I confess to a certain reluctance to lose the old title "A Voice out of the 
                Sea"<ptr target="n0671"/> of that most splendid poem (rated by most of your English admirers, I observe, as 
                the finest of all, <choice><sic>tho</sic><corr>though</corr></choice> I am not prepared to acquiesce in that 
                estimate): however, in this as all 
                other respects where the editions differ, I have followed your new edition. Many thanks also for the separate poem subsequently 
                received "After all, not to create only"&#8212;replete with impor<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01882.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>tant 
                truths.&#8212;I don't well know when my American Selection will be out: my work on it is done, &#38; the rest depends on the 
                printer &#38; publisher. I shall hope to beg your acceptance of a copy in due course.</p>
            <p>I sent on the copy of your works transmitted for "The Lady,"<ptr target="n0525"/> after some little delay occasioned by my being 
                absent from England up to the end of August. She was (&#38; I think still is) in the country: but, to judge from a letter of 
                acknowledgement she wrote me, you have probably by this time heard from her direct. I know also that you have heard from Profr. 
                Dowden,<ptr target="n0199"/> the writer of the ar<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01882.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>ticle

            <p>Mr. Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> called here<ptr target="loc.01882_n2"/>on 5 Octr., &#38; is to dine with us
                tomorrow: I like his frank manly aspect &#38; tone, 
                &#38; need not say that you were a principal subject of conversation between us. He seems very considerably 
                impressed with the objects 
                &#38; matter of interest in London: I wish it might be my good fortune to see you here also

                while past, but, as I learn 
                from Burroughs, the prospect is as yet not a very definite one.</p>
