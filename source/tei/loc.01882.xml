                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I was extremely obliged to you for the present of your photograph &amp; books; the
                vol. of poems containing (what I now read for the first time in that stage) the
                important section of <hi rend="underline">Passage to India</hi><!-- <ptr target="n0465"/> -->, &amp; many modifications here &amp; there in other compositions. It happens that
                I have lately been compiling a vol. of selections from American Poets<!-- <ptr target="n0523"/> -->, &amp; I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> had to use your earlier
                editions for <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01882.002.jpg" type="verso"/> the
                purposes of this compilation: but I have now set those aside, &amp; used your new
                edition throughout&#8212;so the kind &amp; welcome gift came to me at a very
                apposite moment. I confess to a certain reluctance to lose the old title "A Voice
                out of the Sea"<!-- <ptr target="n0671"/> --> of that most splendid poem (rated by most of
                your English admirers, I observe, as the finest of all, <choice>
                    <sic>tho</sic>
                    <corr>though</corr>
                </choice> I am not prepared to acquiesce in that estimate): however, in this, as all
                others where the editions differ, I have followed your new edition. Many thanks also
                for the separate poem subsequently received "After all, not to create
                only"&#8212;replete with important <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01882.003.jpg" type="recto"/> truths.&#8212;I don't well know when my "American Selection" will
                be out: my work on it is done, &amp; the rest depends on the printer &amp;
                publisher. I shall hope to beg your acceptance of a copy in due course.</p>
            <p>I sent on the copy of your works transmitted for "The Lady"<!-- <ptr target="n0525"/> -->
                after some little delay occasioned by my being absent from England up to the end of
                August. She was (&amp; I think still is) in the country: but, to judge from a letter
                of acknowledgement she wrote me, you have probably this time heard from her direct.
                I know also that you have heard from Prof. Dowden<!-- <ptr target="n0199"/> -->, the writer
                of the article <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01882.004.jpg" type="verso"/> in the
                Westminster<!-- <ptr target="n0692"/> -->.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burroughs called here on 5 Octr., &amp; is to dine with us tomorrow: I like his
                frank manly aspect &amp; tone, and need not say that you were a principal subject of
                conversation between us. He seems very considerably impressed with the objects &amp;
                matter of interest in London: I wish it might be my good fortune to see you here
                also <choice>
                    <sic>some day</sic>
                    <corr>someday</corr>
                </choice>. <choice>

                    <reg>Rumors</reg>
                </choice> of your projected arrival have been rife for some while past, but, as I
                learn from Burroughs, the prospect is as yet not a very definite one.</p>
