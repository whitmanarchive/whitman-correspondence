            <p>At last I am beginning to feel myself again after a four months spell of illness&#8212;indeed I may say it is a year since I have really felt well&#8212;for I was slowly running down all last spring &amp; summer. Then came bronchitis &#38; cardiac asthma&#8212;then being in that state closely shut up in our new house I was tremendously poisoned by the first paint, which was very slow in drying&#8212;&#38; that

                brought on jaundice &#38; such excessive weakness &#38; irritability of stomach that for three months I was well nigh starved. But now the Sun shines again for me &#38; I am picking up very fast. Dear Giddy has been such an indefatigable &#38; capital nurse &#38; housekeeper!&#8212;&#38; has acquired a great deal of valuable experience &#38; so, for that matter have I. I feel as if my usual good health has made me obtuse &#38; unsympathetic towards the ailing. Now I understand them.</p>

            <p>Dear friend what welcome tidings of yourself &#38; what beautiful things to read

                have you sent to cheer me up all this while and I was never so that I could not enjoy them &#38; mentally return you a grasp of the hand then in silence. There are autobiographical touches in those last notes in the "Critic" &#38; in "Cedar Plums" that are especially precious to me &#38; I doubt not will be so to all friends &#38; lovers of yours. Even now do I go with and heartily believe in the North American Review article.</p>
            
            <p>Our friend Edward Carpenter (whom we all grow to love better &#38; better every time we are with him) has lost his mother lately&#8212;suddenly&#8212;a

            short attack of bronchitis which did not seem severe, but she was much worn with tending her aged husband. It was a gentle peaceful end. "All is as it should be" she kept saying to herself with a tranquil smile.&#8212;Bee has written you about herself. It was very hard for us to be sundered during my illness&#8212;but was the right thing to do, she was so much wanted where she was &#38; learning so much too. Herby is working away heart &#38; soul with his brush &#38; is making great progress.&#8212;There are plenty of gardens &#38; open heath &#38; old trees round about our pleasant home &#38; the birds tell us of spring early every morning. Friendly greetings to <choice><abbr>yr.</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> brother &#38; sister.
