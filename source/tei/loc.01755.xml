                <salute>Dear son,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I sent you a postal card yesterday that the bundle had come all right, 
                with the right things I wanted. My condition is still what may be called 
                favorable&#8212;that is I still keep up without having any of those decidedly 
                bad spells&#8212;<hi rend="underline">blurs</hi> as I call them&#8212;of a while ago&#8212;&amp; in general I feel as 
                well &amp; as strong (such as it all was) as before I was taken 
                with those spells. I go out again a little.
            </p>
            
            <p>Pete I told you about a young railroad man, Tom Osler, 26 years old, 
                that I met occasionally &amp; talked with, that had a felon on his hand&#8212;I took quite a fancy to him, &amp; he to me&#8212;Well, he is dead, killed instantly&#8212;(I have marked the piece in the paper already sent)&#8212;I went around yesterday 
                to where he lived, it is near here, he was married, leaves a young widow, 
                &amp; a nice little 2 year old boy&#8212;I saw them&#8212;his body, broken &amp; scalded, 
                lay in the front room&#8212;Whenever you have the <hi rend="underline">Star</hi> or <hi rend="underline">Republican</hi> once 
                in a while you can send them (you can send 2 for a 1 <hi rend="superscript">ct</hi> stamp) I <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice>
                mind their being a little old&#8212;I see the <hi rend="underline">Chronicle</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Capital</hi> at the 
                reading room&#8212;I am feeling full as well as usual to-day, &amp; think of 
                going out &amp; across the ferry&#8212;it is so pleasant this afternoon</p></div1>
            
            
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01755.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <div1 type="section">
            <dateline><date><hi rend="underline">Friday afternoon</hi></date></dateline><p>&#8212;I went out yesterday afternoon&#8212;across to Philadelphia, 
                &amp; up to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, I have spoken of. Yesterday, 
                &amp; yesterday evening I felt better than usual&#8212;but am not so well to-day&#8212;the worst of my case is these <hi rend="underline">fall backs</hi>&#8212;But I have been out a little to-day. 
                My walking does not improve any at all. (Then to make things more <hi rend="underline">cheerful</hi>, 
                there are many deaths hereabout from paralysis)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I quite miss poor Tom Osler. I am in the habit of sitting of the forenoon 
                by the first-floor window, reading the papers, &amp; Tom would often stop a few minutes 
                &amp; talk to me at the window, on his way to &amp; from the depot&#8212;He would never come 
                in the house, but seemed to like to stop &amp; talk that way with me. My boy<ptr target="loc.01755_n1"/> that had his eye hurt is doing rather badly too. About myself, my <hi rend="underline">general strength</hi> 
                not only holds out, but I think rather improves, which helps a good deal. 
                Your postal card came&#8212;also a letter from Eldridge, enclosing the key. 
                
            </p></div1>
