                <p>
                   It is proposed to hold a Burnsiana Exhibition in Glasgow where a Meeting of those 
                   favourable to the proposal will be convened during next month. The promoters 
                   have in view a Loan Exhibition embracing Mss. of the Poet, the best editions of his works, painted 
                   &#38; engraved portraits of the Poet, as well as some of his friends and biographers, painted and 
                   engraved illustration of his works and of the scenes associated with his name; also the best books, 
                   magazines of early date &amp;c that in any direct way relate to Burns. We hope also to gather some 
                   items that formed part of the personal belongings of Burns &#38; his family.</p>
                <p>Such an Exhibition in Glasgow&#8212;the capital of the West of Scotland&#8212;where Burnsiana property 
                    is largely held will be most appropriate in itself, and could not fail to excercise a healthy influence 
                    on all classes of the community.</p>
