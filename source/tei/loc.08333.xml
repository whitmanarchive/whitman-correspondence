            </opener>
            <p>
                I was very sorry indeed to hear a little while ago
                that you were so ill &#38; should have written at once
                to Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> to make inquiries
                if I had not heard rumours of your having been moved
                from your house southwards, so I wrote to Herbert
                Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> instead &#38; as far as
                I gather from a short postcard he has written in reply
                you are still in Camden. However, not feeling quite sure,
                I thought
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_tb.00023.jpg" type="verso"/>
                I had better write to you first and hear if you are at
                home before sending you the yearly gift from myself
                and friends&#8212;I earnestly hope to hear in reply 
                that you are pretty well again &#38; out of pain.</p>
            <p>
                I don't know whether you remember enough of me to recal
                that I had been a good invalided of late years through
                sleeplessness. I determined a year ago to try the manual
                labour cure &#38; have been working since as a carpenter
                (an art which I learnt as a boy) &#38; it has done me so
                much good that I hope to return soon to my proper work
                of teacher.</p>
            <p>
                I have lately lent your poems
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_tb.00024.jpg" type="recto"/>
                to two new friends &#38; have had the satisfaction of gaining
                their gratitude thereby&#8212;One of them was very much in need
                of the help to be found in them.</p>
            <p>
                With much love &#38; kind remembrances to yourself &#38;
                Mrs Davis
