            <p>The reason of my writing this letter is because I have not got even a short letter
                from you to <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="10" unit="chars"/> you got one which I wrote about a month ago. Maybe the old man has been

                pleasant morning, this Thursday, March 14. Temperature agreeable even to a still or

                person&#8212;no wind, a good deal smoky, birds chirping, children playing noisily
                and sweeping the yard. My boy is running my plow&#8212;preparing ground for our
                usual cotton crop&#8212;somehow there seems never to be much use for us to raise anything else&#8212;people buy too much of our other produce with <hi rend="underline"
                    >promises</hi> which they do not comply with.</p>

            <p>It looks like that I ought to be happy today&#8212;a home, my own&#8212;family

                stylish, or dressy and luxurious so far as able; pretty good common sense, somewhat
