                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have thought of you very often since I have been up here, but have hardly had the
                time to write &amp; tell you so. I left W. in great haste &amp; since I have been
                here have been in the midst of a very maelstrom of business, all
                new, all strange, &amp; very mixed; but I am now fairly master of the situation,
                &amp; though I do not expect my troubles are over, yet I am better prepared to meet
                them. I have got a good accountant, a <choice><orig>com-

                attorney, a balance in the bank &amp; ought to be happy. But it cost me a hang to leave W. I was so
                warm &amp; snug &amp; my nest was so well feathered; but I have really cut loose
                &amp; do not expect to return again except briefly. I can make more money here, be
                much freer, be nearer home &amp; have a new field of duties. My greatest loss will
                be in you my dear Walt, but then I shall look forward to having you up here a good
                long time at a stretch, which will be better than the crumbs I used to get of you in
                W. I expect it will take me a year or more to close up this bank, then I shall make
                me another nest <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01119.003.jpg" type="recto"/>among
                the rocks of the Hudson and try life my own master. I hope you are well &amp; will
                write to me, &amp; will go up &amp; see my wife. It is very cold &amp; wintery here,
                the thermometer at zero yesterday. I have just been out taking a sleigh ride &amp;
                enjoyed it much.</p>
            <p>I have collected &amp; turned over to the Government $13,000 since I have been here
                &amp; have about $100,000 more to collect. By &amp; by I shall have plenty of time to
                myself.</p>
