                </choice> a magazine (the Galaxy)<!-- <ptr target="n0254"/> --> from you yesterday, which I have
                been preparing in a little to day, but the day has been so beautiful &amp; the charm
                of the open air so great that I could not long keep my eyes on the printed page. The
                season is at last fairly in for it, and the fruit trees are all getting in bloom. My
                bees are working like beavers &amp; there is a stream of golden thighs pouring into
                the hive all the time. I can do almost anything with them &amp; they wont sting me.
                Yesterday I turned a hive up &amp; pruned it, that is cut out a lot of old dirty
                comb; the little fellows were badly frightened &amp; came pouring out in great
                consternation, but did not offer to sting me. I am <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01124.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

                <note resp="#ww" type="editorial" place="bottom">&#8212;5&#8212;</note> going to transfer a
                swarm in a day or two to a new style of hive. I spend all my time at work about the
                place &amp; like it much. I run over to M. to look after bank matters for a day or
                two then back here. The house is being plastered &amp; will be finished during the
                summer. The wrens &amp; robins &amp; phoebe birds have already taken possession of
                various nooks of it, &amp; if they are allowed to go on with their building I must
                stop mine. During that snow storm the last of april the Hermit thrush took refuge in
                it. We are surrounded with birds here &amp; they are a great comfort &amp; delight
                to me.</p>

            <p>Your room is ready for you &amp; your breakfast plate warmed. When will you come? I
                know the change would do you good &amp; your presence would certainly do us good. We
                are counting on your coming &amp; do not disappoint us. I will meet you in N.Y. if
                you will tell me when. Let us hear from you soon. Ursula sends love.</p>
