            </opener>

            <p>Do not think me too wilful or headstrong but I have taken our tickets &amp; we shall
                sail Aug 30, for Philadelphia. I found if I did not come to a decision now, we could
                not well arrange it before next summer. And since we <hi rend="underline">have</hi>
                <!-- I see a "too" here, or did Anne cross it out? -JS -->come to a decision <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02886.002.jpg" type="verso"/> my mind has been quite
                at rest. Do not feel any anxiety or misgivings about us. I have a clear and strong
                conviction I am doing what is right &amp; best for us all.&#8212;After a busy
                anxious time I am having a week or two, rest with Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02886_n3"/> -->, who I find fairly well in health &amp; prospering in his
                business&#8212;indeed he bids fair to have a large private practice as an analyst
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02886.003.jpg" type="recto"/> here, &amp; is
                already making income enough to marry on only there is to build the nest&#8212;&amp;
                I think he will have actually to <hi rend="underline">build</hi> it, for there seem
                no eligible houses&#8212; &amp; to furnish that the wedding will not be till next
                spring or early summer&#8212;nevertheless with a definite goal &amp; a definite time
                &amp; the way between not so very rugged though rather dull &amp; lonely I think he
                will be pretty cheery. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02886.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                This little town (of 11000 inhabitants all miners, smelters &amp;c.) lies up among
                the hill 1100 ft above the sea&#8212;glorious hills here spreading then converging,
                with wooded flanks &amp; swift brooklets leaping over stones in the
                hollows&#8212;the air too of course deliciously light &amp; pure.&#8212;I have heard
                through a friend of ours of Bee's<!-- <ptr target="loc.02886_n1"/> --> fellow
                students who lives in Camden (Mr. Suerkrop <!-- could not ID Suerkrop #zk --> I
                think his name is) that we shall <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02886.005.jpg" type="recto"/> be able to get a very comfortable home with pleasant garden there
                for about £55 per an: I think I can manage that very well&#8212;so all I need
                is to hear of a comfortable lodging or boarding house (the former preferred,) where
                we can be, avoiding hotel even while we hunt for the house. I have arranged for my
                goods to sail a week <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02886.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                later than we do, so as to give us time. </p>
