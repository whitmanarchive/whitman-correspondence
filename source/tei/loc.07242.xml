            <p>All quiet here and another perfect autumn day. Your card of 13th came this morning. I
                think it is wonderful how perfect your handwriting keeps through all your illness
                and feebleness. No I would not recommend Froude's<ptr target="loc.07242_n2"/>
                    Carlyle<ptr target="n4301"/> to a man who needed cheering up. I read it a few
                years ago and it nearly gave me an attack of melancholia. I look upon that same
                Carlyle as being (or having been?) one of the worst "cranks" that ever lived. And he
                certainly had about as bad a time of it <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_es.00369.jpg" type="verso"/> for 86 years as any man ever had in this
                world. Nothing gave him pleasure, nearly everything gave him pain. As long as his
                wife lived her presence only seemed to add to his worry and gloom; as soon as she
                was dead he was more gloomy and worried more than ever because he had lost her! He
                was a bad sample and she was little (if any?) better. He couldn't even live with his
                favorite brother John! I think his ignorant old mother with her pipe was the best of the lot;
                think I could have liked her&#8212;I shall like to know C. by &#38; by to see what
                he is like in the next world but I never expect to care much about him!</p>
