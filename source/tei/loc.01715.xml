        <salute>Dear John Burroughs,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I rec'd your letter, &amp; was glad to hear from you&#8212;I am still in a pretty bad way&#8212;I am writing this over at the office, at my desk, but feel to-day more like laying 
        down than sitting up&#8212;I do not walk any better, &amp; my head has frequent distress&#8212;Still, for all that I slowly gain strength&#8212;very slowly&#8212;&amp; <hi rend="italic">shall yet get well as ever</hi>&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Every thing goes on about the same, in the sphere of my affairs, &amp;c. as when I last saw you&#8212;Mother is at Camden&#8212;mopes &amp; worries a good deal about me&#8212;I don't feel like leaving here, 
        for visiting or any purpose, until I get so I can move about&#8212;The doctor is applying electricity, every other day&#8212;I have had it now five or six times&#8212;I anticipate benefit, in a while, but it makes no perceptible difference yet&#8212;How and where is 'Sula? I wish I was where I could come in &amp; see her &amp; you often&#8212;(those nice breakfasts were bright spots, &amp; I shall not forget them)&#8212;if I could just get 'round and sit an hour or so for a change, &amp; chat with 'Sula and you, 
        two or three times a week, I believe it would do me good&#8212;but I must take 
        it out in imagination&#8212;for it is impossible in reality&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I got a long letter from Dowden<ptr target="loc.01715_n3"/>&#8212;he mentions you&#8212;As I sit I look over from my office window on the President's grounds&#8212;the grass is green enough&#8212;they have already been over it once with the cutter, 
        &amp; Saturday there were men out there in their shirt-sleeves raking it up&#8212;I have a big bunch of lilacs in a pitcher in my room&#8212;Washington looks about the same&#8212;rather cool &amp; cloudy to-day&#8212;but pleasant weather may-be by the time you receive this&#8212;best love to you &amp; 'Sula<ptr target="loc.01715_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
