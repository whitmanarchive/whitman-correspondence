        <salute>Dear John Burroughs,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I rec'd your letter, &amp; was glad to hear from you—I am still in a pretty bad way—I am writing this over at the office, at my desk, but feel to-day more like laying 
        down than sitting up—I do not walk any better, &amp; my head has frequent distress—Still, for all that I slowly gain strength—very slowly—&amp; <hi rend="italic">shall yet get well as ever</hi>—</p>
      
      <p>Every thing goes on about the same, in the sphere of my affairs, &amp;c. as when I last saw you—Mother is at Camden—mopes &amp; worries a good deal about me—I don't feel like leaving here, 
        for visiting or any purpose, until I get so I can move about—The doctor is applying electricity, every other day—I have had it now five or six times—I anticipate benefit, in a while, but it makes no perceptible difference yet—How and where is 'Sula? I wish I was where I could come in &amp; see her &amp; you often—(those nice breakfasts were bright spots, &amp; I shall not forget them)—if I could just get 'round and sit an hour or so for a change, &amp; chat with 'Sula and you, 
        two or three times a week, I believe it would do me good—but I must take 
        it out in imagination—for it is impossible in reality—</p>
      
      <p>I got a long letter from Dowden<ptr target="loc.01715_n3"/>—he mentions you—As I sit I look over from my office window on the President's grounds—the grass is green enough—they have already been over it once with the cutter, 
        &amp; Saturday there were men out there in their shirt-sleeves raking it up—I have a big bunch of lilacs in a pitcher in my room—Washington looks about the same—rather cool &amp; cloudy to-day—but pleasant weather may-be by the time you receive this—best love to you &amp; 'Sula<ptr target="loc.01715_n4"/>—</p>
