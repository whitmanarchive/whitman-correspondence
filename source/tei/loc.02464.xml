                about you.</p>
            <p>My best thanks to you for all &#38; for your loving benediction &#38; "heart full of
                good wishes &#38; affectionate regards" to JWW<ptr target="n6121"/> &#38;
                myself.</p>
            <p>The same mail brought me a good letter from Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38;
                J.W.W received one from H.L.T<ptr target="n4267"/> both of which were <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02464.004.jpg" type="verso"/> cordially welcomed on
                a/c of the details concerning yourself which they contained. H.L.T's we are proud
                to have not only for these but for the renewed expression of your love for us &#38;
                for this I desire to send you my warmest thanks &#38; I should like you to convey my
                gratitude to him for his dear good letter.</p>
            <p>I hear too that J.W.W has also received a paper with the S.K. article from you. A
                letter, post card, &#38; slip from you, a paper &#38; slip from you, a letter from
                H.L.T. &#38; a letter from Warry all by one mail! What a jubilee we've had this
                week!</p>

            <p>I believe it is JWWs intention to write to JA Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> next week
                &#38; to send him copies of HLT's &#38; Warry's letters so as to put him <hi

                you</p>
            <p>S.K's article is extremely interesting &#38; valuable from the side light it throws
                upon your character and personality.</p>
            <p>In this week's <hi rend="underline">Literary World</hi> there is a long notice of an
                Italian book on Holland<ptr target="loc.07897_n8"/> &#38; as I thought the extracts given might interest you I
                send you the paper in which you will also see that a new poem by Tennyson<ptr
                    target="n0625"/> is announced</p>
            <p>We are looking forward with pleasure to seeing the <pb xml:id="leaf003v"

                believe.</p>              
            <p>I much regret to hear that your health continues so unsatisfactory &#38; I fear that
                this long continued spell of illness may tell even upon <hi rend="underline"
                    >your</hi> mastery &#38; indomitable spirit. Of my sympathy you are already
                assured &#38; what can I say but renew the expression of my personal affection &#38;
                reverence for you &#38; send you a "heart full of good wishes" &#38; hopes for the
                dawning of brighter days for you. May God grant that it may be so is my heart felt
                prayer. But as you say&#8212;"it will be all right either way."</p>

                butterfly having been seen&#8212;a harbinger of the coming spring.</p>
