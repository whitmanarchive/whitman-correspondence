            <p>Just a few lines to supplement Dr Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> letter to you
                this morning &amp; to tell you what a good time we are having.<ptr target="loc.02497_n2"/></p>
            <p>Yesterday &amp; today have been red letter days for us all. What a splendid fellow
                the doctor is! He has won all our hearts &amp; we shall grudge to part with him.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02497.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Yesterday we had a glorious drive all round Belmont &amp; Rivington. The day was
                magnificently fine &amp; not too hot &amp; we all enjoyed it greatly. Had tea at the
                Revd JW Thompson's<ptr target="loc.02497_n4"/> house in Rivington&#8212;a charming little
                rural retreat all embowered in honeysuckle, foxgloves &amp; roses.</p>
            <p>Evening spent here. Nearly all the boys present.<ptr target="loc.02538_n2"/> A downright good time. Dr read us
                your kind messages &amp; gave us lots of interesting talk about you.
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02497.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                After supper came songs, recitations&#8212;Will Law,<ptr target="loc.02497_n3"/> our comic man 
                in great form&#8212;speeches &amp;c, from Wallace,<ptr target="n6121"/> 
                Hutton &amp; Dr B. Fun &amp; frolic kept up till midnight.</p>  
            <p>We gave Dr "a touch of our quality" &amp; I think he enjoyed it. 
                He stayed indoors this forenoon, writing &amp; this aft. a few of us 
                went to Rivington with him &amp; making our way to the secluded spot 
                where we celebrated your birthday&#8212;a tree
                there has carved on it "May 31 '91"<ptr target="loc.02497_n5"/>&#8212;we sat down while Dr read to us his paper
                upon you (intended for the forthcoming book)<ptr target="loc.08152_n2"/> while the trees waved 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02497.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                overhead, the birds sang, the cattle lowed, the haymowing machine whirred &amp; now 
                &amp; then the strains of a band of music belonging to a Sunday school party 
                having their "field day" floated on the breeze.</p>
            <p>Wallace made a neat speech in praise &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">partial</unclear>
                criticism of that most impressively striking essay of the D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>'s &amp; 
                we all enjoyed our hour &amp; a half there immensely&#8212;</p>
            <p>Altogether a most memorable afternoon</p>
            <p>Returning we had tea at Wallace's where I left them to attend to some professional
                work here.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02497.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Please thank Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &amp; Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/>
                for the Canary bird<ptr target="loc.08056_n2"/> which the Dr brought safely.&#8212;I have given
                it to Wallace as Warry just mentioned it in a letter to him &amp; we had the
                impression that it was <hi rend="underline">originally</hi> intended for him. But we
                regard it as a joint possession &amp; it now graces Wallaces mantelpiece directly
                underneath your portrait</p>
            <p>They all send their love to you as does</p>

                <p>Please thank Traubel for the photos wh Dr B thinks do not do him
                    justice&#8212;they give a wrong impression of him.</p>
