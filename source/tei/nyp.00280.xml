            <p>Well, it is a dark cloudy day, &amp; raining hard—the darkies were to have a
                great celebration here to-day, in honor of emancipation—they turn out here in
                real good style, on such occasions—but it is too wet for them to-day—Mr. Stanbery is quite ill, as you see by the papers—The Impeachment trial
                still goes on—I went up, that day,<ptr target="nyp.00280_n1"/> but it was very crowded,
                &amp; the air was so bad, I left, &amp; went off &amp; had a real good tramp, way up
                Georgetown, along the banks of the river—it is beautiful along there, of a
                fine day—So you see I am still able to get around.</p>

            <p>There is nothing new in the office—the same old story—I have rec'd a
                number of papers from England with notices of my book, there—mostly friendly
                &amp; favorable—more so than any here<ptr target="nyp.00280_n2"/>—Mother, I am very sorry you have those pains in your
                face &amp; head<ptr target="nyp.00280_n3"/>—I shouldn't wonder if it was neuralgia—that is a
                violent inflammation of the nerves of the face &amp; head—Mrs. Mix<ptr target="nyp.00280_n4"/> used to have it very bad—O, I
                forgot I believe to tell you Mrs. Mix is living yet—she had a very bad spell,
                but got over it—Mother, I have just got your letter of 14th—&amp; was
                glad to get it—I havn't seen William Velsor<ptr target="nyp.00280_n5"/> for some time—will tell him when I see him—</p>

            <p>Mother, I send a couple of papers same time with this—they are not much, but
                will do just for a change—poor old Uncle John<ptr target="nyp.00280_n6"/>—he is failing then
                at last—I suppose George<ptr target="nyp.00280_n7"/> is well, &amp; having good times—I see him
                every day as I have his picture tacked up on the door of my desk in front—Good bye, dearest mother, &amp; take good care of yourself, &amp; dont work too
                hard.</p>
