                <salute>My dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received a few days since your last letter. It is very pleasant to me to find you
                liked my <choice>
                    <sic>Shakspere</sic>
                    <corr><name type="person">Shakespeare</name></corr>
                </choice> book, but much more to know that you are not indifferent to me, myself,
                &amp; do not think of me as a stranger.</p>

            <p>The report of your health makes us both hopeful &amp; anxious. I do not know whether
                your American Summers are as health–bringing as our Summers, but I should
                suppose they have a decided advantage over your winters in this respect
                (notwithstanding all John Burroughs says of Winter Sunshine) for an invalid; so it
                is chiefly from the summer that we shall look for an advance towards recovery</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01496.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>The newspaper statement of the attitude of the American public towards you is a
                surprise &amp; a disappointment</p>
            <p>We had been misled by a correspondent of <hi rend="underline">The Academy</hi>, which
                is a paper always friendly to you, into quite a different view of things&#8212;I am
                waiting until next Saturday to see whether Rossetti<!-- <ptr target="n0522"/> --> has
                inserted this statement in the Academy. If he has not, I will write to him &amp; try
                to get it printed there.</p>

            <p>Two friends, Professor Atkinson of <choice>
                    <abbr>Trin. Coll.</abbr>
                    <expan>Trinity College</expan>
            </choice> Dublin, &amp; Stoker<!-- <ptr target="n0602"/> -->, who writes to you, have asked me to get copies of
                your <hi rend="underline">Three</hi> volumes, <choice>
                    <abbr>L of G</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice>, Two Rivulets &amp; Memoranda. But I do not doubt that half–a dozen
                of my friends will wish to have the <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01496.004.jpg" type="recto"/> books, so I should be obliged if you would send a parcel
                containing six copies of Each book&#8212;the Authograph 1876–Edition. Stoker
                wishes me to ask you to put, if you do not object, his name (Abraham Stoker) &amp;
                your own in the copies for him&amp;</p>

            <p>He has told you perhaps of a very lively debate we had at our "Fortnightly Club" on
                "The genius of Walt Whitman" last Monday Evening <choice>
                    <abbr>Feb</abbr>
                    <expan>February</expan>
                </choice> 14 <hi rend="underline">th</hi> A most savage,
                but ill–planned, attack opened the discussion. I followed with a speech which
                consisted in the main of apt selections from <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> &amp; Democratic Vistas, &amp; these were felt by my hearers to be a very
                effective answer to the previous speaker's extravagant statements. Men, to my
                surprise &amp; great satisfaction, followed speaker <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01496.003.jpg" type="verso"/> after speaker on the Whitman
                side,&#8212;a barrister, a young clergyman, a man in business, &amp; others, while
                the remaining speakers were three, one who placed you below Victor Hugo on the
                ground of alleged deficiency of <hi rend="underline">form</hi> &amp; beauty in your
                poems, one who announced that he had never read your books but was sure you could
                have written nothing as good as Burns' "Cotter's Saturday Night", &amp; a third
                recently introduced to <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> &amp; who confessed to having discovered some few great poems, but much
                that baffled him, &amp; that should be challenged.</p>

            <p>The result was on the whole highly satisfactory. It was the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Evening occupied by you during the present session.</p>

            <p>These little skirmishes, however, are only occasional incidents in the quiet progress
                which as I said before I am <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01496.005.jpg" type="recto"/> convinced your writings are making.</p>

            <p>I was very glad to hear of Burroughs. I still owe him a letter of thanks for his <hi rend="underline">Winter Sunshine.</hi></p>

            <p>I Enclose a draft for the Equivalent of <hi rend="underline">sixty dollars</hi>.
                Please send the parcel to me at the following address
                <address>
                <addrLine><name>Winstead</name></addrLine>

                <addrLine><name>Dublin</name>.</addrLine>
           </address>
                And now, dear friend, goodbye. Be sure that any tidings of you, good or the reverse
                of good, will always be of great concern to me, &amp; write a line when it suits
                you, but at no other time.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Yours always,</salute>
                <signed>Edward Dowden</signed>

                <p>P.S. If you have any Magazine articles why not try <hi rend="underline">The
                        Gentlemans Magazine</hi>&#8212;if a poem, or&#8212;better&#8212;if prose <hi rend="underline">The Fortnightly Review</hi><!-- <ptr target="n0242"/> -->?</p>
                <p>But have a 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi>hi&gt; copy of
                    the MS made to avoid the risk of its being lost&#8212;</p>
                <p>I strongly incline to think Morley of the Fortnightly Review would be glad to
                    hear from you, if you have anything suitable.</p>
                <p>It also occurs to me that some arrangement might be come to with <choice>
                        <abbr>Messrs</abbr>
                        <expan>Messieurs</expan>
                    </choice> Chatto &amp; Windus to publish your Two Rivulets &amp;c., &amp; give
                    you a royalty on copies sold. I will writ to Rossetti about this.</p>
