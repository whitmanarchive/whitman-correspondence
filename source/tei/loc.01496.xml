            </opener>

            <p>I received a few days since your last letter.<ptr target="n5002d"/> It is very pleasant to me to find you liked my 
                <choice><sic>Shakspere</sic><corr>Shakespeare</corr></choice> book,<ptr target="n0756b"/> but 
                much more to know that you are not indifferent to me, myself, &amp; do not think of me as a 
                stranger.</p>
            <p>The report of your health makes us both hopeful &amp; anxious. I do not know whether your American 
                Summers are as health-bringing as our Summers, but I should suppose they have a decided 
                advantage over your winters in this respect (notwithstanding all John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> 
                says of Winter Sunshine<ptr target="uva.00392_n3"/>) for an invalid; so it is chiefly from the summer that we shall look 
                for an advance towards recovery</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01496.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>The newspaper statement of the attitude of the American public towards you is a surprise &amp; 
                a disappointment We had been misled by a correspondent of <hi rend="underline">The Academy</hi>,<ptr target="loc.02532_n6"/> 
                which is a paper always friendly to you, into quite a different view of things&#8212;I am waiting 
                until next Saturday to see whether Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> has inserted this statement 
                in the Academy. If he has not, I will write to him &amp; try to get it printed there.</p>
            <p>Two friends, Professor Atkinson<ptr target="n0050"/> of <choice><abbr>Trin. Coll.</abbr><expan>Trinity College</expan></choice> 
                Dublin, &amp; Stoker,<ptr target="n0602"/> who writes to you,<ptr target="loc.01496_n1"/> have asked me to get copies of 
                your <hi rend="underline">Three</hi> volumes, L of G, Two Rivulets<ptr target="loc.01235_n1"/> &amp; Memoranda.<ptr target="uva.00381_n7"/>
                But I do not doubt that half-a dozen of my friends will wish to have the 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01496.004_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                books, so I should be obliged if you would send a parcel containing six copies of Each book&#8212;the 
                Autograph 1876-Edition. Stoker wishes me to ask you to put, if you do not object, his 
                name (Abraham Stoker) &amp; your own in the copies for him&#8212;</p>
            <p>He has told you perhaps of a very lively debate we had at our "Fortnightly Club" on "The genius 
                of Walt Whitman" last Monday Evening Feb 14<hi rend="underline">th</hi> A most savage, but 
                ill-planned, attack opened the discussion. I followed with a speech which consisted in 
                the main of apt selections from L. of G. &amp; Democratic Vistas,<ptr target="n4122"/> &amp; these were felt by my 
                hearers to be a very effective answer to the previous speaker's extravagant statements. Then, 
                to my surprise &amp; great satisfaction, followed speaker 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01496.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                after speaker on the Whitman side,&#8212;a barrister, a young clergyman, a man in business, 
                &amp; others, while the remaining speakers were three, one who placed you below Victor Hugo<ptr target="n4276"/> 
                on the ground of alleged deficiency of <hi rend="underline">form</hi> &amp; beauty in your poems, 
                one who announced that he had never read your books but was sure you could have written nothing 
                as good as Burns'<ptr target="n0127"/> "Cotter's Saturday Night", &amp; a third recently 
                introduced to L. of G. &amp; who confessed to having discovered some few great poems, but much 
                that baffled him, &amp; that should be challenged.</p>
            <p>The result was on the whole highly satisfactory. It was the 2nd Evening occupied by you during 
                the present session.</p>
            <p>These little skirmishes, however, are only occasional incidents in the quiet progress which as 
                I said before I am 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01496.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                convinced your writings are making.</p>
            <p>I was very glad to hear of Burroughs. I still owe him a letter of thanks for his <hi rend="underline">Winter Sunshine.</hi></p>
            <p>I Enclose a draft for the Equivalent of <hi rend="underline">sixty dollars</hi>. Please send the 
                parcel to me at the following address
                <address>

                    <addrLine>Dublin.</addrLine>
                </address></p>
            <p>And now, dear friend, goodbye. Be sure that any tidings of you, good or the reverse of good, will 
                always be of great concern to me, &amp; write a line when it suits you, but at no other time.</p>

                <p>I strongly incline to think Morley<ptr target="loc.01571_n2"/> of the Fortnightly Review would be glad to hear from 
                    you, if you have anything suitable.</p>
