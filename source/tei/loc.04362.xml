            </opener>
            <p>I don't feel that I should apologize for writing to you.<!--<ptr target="loc.04362_n1"/>--> I have wanted to do so for
                years. I have loved you for years with my whole heart and soul. No man ever lived
                whom I have so desired to take by the hand as you. I read Leaves of grass, and got
                new conceptions of the dignity and beauty of my own body and of the bodies of other
                people; and life became more valuable in consequence. After a year or
                two&#8212;always carrying you in my thoughts&#8212;holding imaginary conversations
                with you and dreaming of you day and night&#8212;I came across a lady who knew you, Mrs
                Lizzie Denton Seybold, now Baker. She had your portrait painted
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02402_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02403_large.jpg" type="recto"/>    
                in oil. I made
                every effort to induce her to let me have the picture but she would not. Since that
                time&#8212;I was living in glorious California then&#8212;I have read with deepest
                interest every word about you in the papers and magazines, as well as every thing you
                have written. Sometimes I have been furious at what immodest people&#8212;idiots, have
                dared say of you and have longed to write my own pure and true convictions of you.
                But I cannot. I am too impetuous; I feel my subject too deeply. And yet I am a
                writer and make my living by my pen. Now that I have come east this far, where I am
                employed as editor on the Saturday Express,  I have the hope that I may sometime see
                your dearly beloved face, touch with my hand your beautiful grey hair, and possibly
                feel your arm about my waist. Because I love you so I have

                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02405_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                written these
                lines. It is nothing to me who sees them; I am proud of my feeling for you. It has
                educated me; it has done more to raise me from a poor working woman to a splendid
                position on one of the best papers ever published, than all the other influences of
                my life.</p>
            <p>I know you must have many letters from strangers, and so I will not take any more of
                your time in reading what I have to say. Of course I have no hope of receiving an
                answer to this. But I thought it no harm to let you know that my love went with you,
                and perhaps in some unknown way was a blessing to you all these years.</p>
            <p>Good bye dear Walt Whitman&#8212;<hi rend="underline">my beloved</hi>, and may every
                influence in life contribute to your happiness.</p>
