            <p>This is a sacred day for me—a day replete with sweet &amp; tender associations; for it is the

                sat &amp; talked with you—a day for ever memorable to me as one of the three supremely Happy Days in my

            <p>'Tis only a year since I first made your acquaintance; but what a year it 
                has been for me! How rich,
                how full of soul-life! Only a year! And yet I seem to have known you 
              all my life!</p>
            <p>I have thought much of you today &amp; my heart has gone out with a 
              great longing yearning to be
                with you &amp; near you &amp; to bathe myself in the sweet 
                aroma of your personal presence.</p>
            <p>I had hoped to have another association connected with this memorable 
                Day viz:—to meet;

                the <hi rend="underline">Britannic</hi>

            <p>Having an hour at liberty this afternoon I escaped to my little woodland haunt (in Raikes
                wood) where I draft this letter, surrounded by waving, rustling trees, the songs of birds the humming of bees,
                the long slender grasses The flowering umbelliferous plants, the pretty wild flowers upon which at
                this moment the sun is shining &amp; lighting up the recesses of the sloping bank covered with its
                "sight-refreshing green."<ptr target="loc.02496_n4"/></p>
            <p>This morning I read a short letter from your friend Talcott Williams<ptr target="loc.05142_n5"/>
            acknowledging rec<hi rend="underline">t</hi> of the facsimile letter. He tells 
            me that you were then "pretty well"</p>
            <p>I also rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> a good letter 
             (photo's not rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> yet) from H L T<ptr target="n4267"/>

                wh: he says that <hi rend="underline">encouragement</hi> is your guest &amp; 
                that on the whole you
                have spent better days with cheerier converse since than before the 
                dinner<ptr target="loc.04326_n3"/> &amp; that the weather is in
                your favour. As I cannot write to him now wd you please kindly thank 
                him for the letter?</p>
            <p>We are indeed delighted to hear such favourable accounts of you &amp; we cordially hope that you will not
                only maintain your ground but gain fresh strength.</p>
            <p>As I write this a thrush pipes near me &amp; seems to say:—"<hi rend="underline">Walt!</hi>
