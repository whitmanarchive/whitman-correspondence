            <p>I once more take the liberty of sending you a few lines to enquire if you have
                received the small Box of Books I sent you on the 8th April per Suttons Parcel
                Despatch. I enclose again the list of the contents of the Box. I have been expecting
                a letter from you these 2 weeks, and so thought I had better write you again in case
                they had not reached you safely, because <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01449.002.jpg" type="verso"/> the longer we delay the report of items
                not arriving safe, the more difficult it becomes to trace where they may have been
                sent to in mistake. I also learn you have written a reply to T. Carlyle's American
                Iliad in a Nutshell. If you possess a Copy of it, I would like to have one, also a
                copy of the original preface to Leaves of Grass. Not now being in possession of the
                original copy of the Poem, I miss the preface from your recent Editions
                much.—In fact I regret very much<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01449.003.jpg" type="recto"/> that you have excluded the preface from your recent Editions, and
                English Readers would no doubt like to see a Copy of your letter to Emerson on
                American Literature, in reply to his letter to you. Copies of Emersons letter I have
                sent to several friends of mine here interested in your Poems. Are you ever in New
                York? I have at present staying there, if not located there for Life, two friends
                from our town. Men that I know would be glad to see you and who would give you some
                details of <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01449.004.jpg" type="verso"/> English
                Life, Literature, Politics, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> likewise, and who I should
                be glad to hear had seen you, and also became friends of yours. there is a certain
                natural talent in them both. one of them has written a few Articles for the Tribune
                on Cooperation and Trade's Unions. The new matters here in a Literary way that may
                be of interest to Note you is the successful result of the Publication of D. G.
                Rossetti's Poems got into the second Edition in 14 Days after first Publication, and
                the next is a series of lectures in the Science of Religion by <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> appearing in Frasers Mag every month also a great success.

                all Men, and God the Father of all. One God, and one Religion, and that Religion in

                Collection you will find all and more then I can write and tell you about of the
                leading ideas and thoughts I sympathize with, and live in hopes of seeing someday
                come to pass amongst us all. and Humanity seems fast moving on to that Noble Epoch,
                despite the changes and groans of some of them—I myself largely sympathize
                with the Quaker teaching <hi rend="underline">No Priesthood</hi>, and would fain
                know something of your Mind on this Matter, and also of Hicks teachings whose name I
