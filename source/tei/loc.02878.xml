            </opener>

            <p>The change down here has refreshed me more than usual and I find my Mother still
                wonderful for her years (the 89th), able to get out
                daily in her Bath chair for two or three hours&#8212; to enjoy our being with her,
                and suffering little or no pain from rheumatism now.&#8212;I hope you have had as
                glorious a summer &amp; harvest as we have and that you are able to be much out of
                doors and absorb the health-giving influences dear Friend. Such mornings! So fresh
                and invigorating. I have been before breakfast mostly in a beautiful garden (the old
                Priory garden) with my beloved Poems and the dew laden flowers and liquid light and
                sweet fresh air, &amp; the sparkle of the pond &amp; delicious greenness of the
                meadows beyond &amp; rustling trees and had a joyful time with you my
                darling&#8212;Sometimes with thoughts that lay hold on "the solid prizes of the
                Universe" sometimes so busy building up a home in America, thinking, dreaming, <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02878.002.jpg" type="verso"/> hoping, loving,
                groping among dim shadows, straining wistful eyes into the dim distance&#8212;then
                to my Poems again&#8212;ah! not groping then, but hand in hand with you breathing
                the air you breathe, with eyes ardently fixed in the same direction your eyes look,
                heart beating strong with the same hopes, aspirations, yours beats with. It does not
                need to be American to love America and to believe in the great future of humanity
                there; it is enough to be human, still more English, to do that. I love &amp;
                believe in &amp; understand her in &amp; through you: but was always drawn towards
                her, always a believer though in a vaguer way that a new glorious day for men &amp;
                women was dawning there, and recognized a new, distinctive American quality very
                congenial to me, even in American virtues <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">whom</unclear> you not perhaps rate highly or regard as decisively
                national, not adequately <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02878.003.jpg" type="recto"/> or commandingly so at any rate. Did I ever tell you the cousin of mine<!-- <ptr target="loc.02878_n1"/> --> who owns the Priory here fought for two years in the Secession war
                in the army of the Potomac when Burnside &amp; McClellan were at the head? John
                Cowardine was Major in a Cavalry regiment&#8212;was at Vicksburg, Frederickburg,
                &amp;c. Never wounded, or but slightly&#8212;had a good deal of outpost duty, being
                just the right sort of man for that &amp; has letters of approval from his Generals
                of which he is not a little proud. Before that fought under the Stars &amp; Stripes
                in Mexico &amp; has had a curiously adventurous career which he commenced by running
                away from a military college where he was being prepared for a cadetship, &amp;
                enlisting as a private&#8212;getting out of that by &amp; bye and working his way
                before the mast as a sailor&#8212;then mining in California&#8212;then in Australia,
                riding steeple chases, keeper of the Melrose hounds, market gardening, hotel
                keeping&#8212;then on his way back to California cast ashore on one of <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02878.004.jpg" type="verso"/> the Navigator Islands
                where he remained for six months the only white man among savages who were friendly
                &amp; made much of him&#8212;now, come into a good estate, married to a woman who
                seems to suit him well &amp; is healthy, cheerful rich &amp; handsome, he has fallen
                into indifferent health &amp; considerable depression of spirits. Perhaps he finds
                the atmosphere of Squirearchical<!-- <ptr target="loc.02878_n2"/> --> gentility very
                stagnant, the bed of roses stifling&#8212;perhaps too the severe privations he has
                at different times undergone have injured him. I often think he was perhaps one of
                those your eyes rested on with pride &amp; admiration&#8212;"handsome tan-faced,
                dressed in blue." He is the very ideal of a soldier in appearance &amp;
                bearing&#8212;has now some fine children of whom he is very fond. </p>

            <p>It was just this time year I received the precious letter and ring that put peace and
                joy and yet such pain of yearning into my <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02878.005.jpg" type="recto"/> heart&#8212;pain for you, my Darling. O
                sorrowing helpless love that waits and must wait useless, afar off, while you
                suffer&#8212;But trying every day of my life to grow fitter more capable of being
                your comfort and joy and true comrade&#8212;never to cease trying this side death or
                the other&#8212; rejoicing in my children more than I ever rejoiced in them before
                now that in and through you I for the first time see and understand humanity (myself
                included) its divine nature, its possibilities, nay, its certainties. How I do long
                for you to see my children dear Friend, and for them to see and love you as they
                will love you, and all their nature unfold and grow more vigorously and joyously
                under your influence. Gracie,<!-- <ptr target="loc.02878_n3"/> -->

                photographs, grows fast,&#8212;is such a fair<!-- Ashley saw "fine" --> blooming
                girl. I hope soon to send you one of Beatrice<!-- <ptr target="loc.02878_n4"/> --> too. They have been enjoying their visit here and are now gone
                home. Gracie for school, Beatrice for the examination at Apoth. Hall she is hoping
                to get through. Then she is coming here to be with my Mother &amp; I going back to
                London: We mean now one or other of us always to be with my Mother here. Herby<!-- <ptr target="loc.02878_n5"/> --> has had such a happy time with his brother in
                Wales&#8212;&amp; is looking as brown as a nut &amp; full of health &amp;
                life&#8212;he had a swim in the sea every day. He did succeed in getting into the
                Academy, &amp; will begin work there Oct. 1st! I <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02878.007.jpg" type="recto"/> received the welcome
                sign from you&#8212;the paper with a deeply interesting narration of the Polaris
                &amp; much else. Be sure dear Friend if there is a word about your health in any
                paper, to send it me&#8212;that is what I search for so eagerly&#8212;to have the
                joyful news you are getting on&#8212;but even if it is but so very very slowly still
                I would rather know the truth&#8212;I do not like thinking of you mistakenly. I want
                to send you the thoughts the yearnings that belong to you the cherishing love that
                enfolds you most tenderly of all when you suffer&#8212;O if I could send it! and the
                cheerful companionship, beguiling the time while strength creeps back&#8212; I hope
                your little nieces at St. Louis are well. </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02878.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Good bye my dearest Friend</p>
            <p>Herby, the only one here with me, would like to join his love with mine. </p>
