               <salute>Dear comrade</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have rec'd your letter of the 6th<ptr target="nyp.00190_n1"/> as it has been sent on to me by Major Hapgood. My dear comrade, I have been very sick, and have been brought on home nearly three weeks ago, after being sick some ten days in Washington&#8212;The doctors say my sickness is from having too deeply imbibed poison into my system from the hospitals&#8212;I had spells of deathly faintness, &amp; the disease also attacked my head &amp; throat pretty seriously&#8212;</p>
            <p>The doctors forbid me going any more into the hospitals&#8212;I did not think much of it, till I got pretty weak, &amp; then they directed me to leave &amp; go north for change of air as soon as I had strength&#8212;But I am making too long a story of it&#8212;I thought only to write you a line&#8212;My dear comrade, I am now over the worst of it &amp; have been getting better the last three days&#8212;my brother took me out in a carriage for a short ride yesterday which is the first I have been out of the house since I have been home&#8212;the doctor tells me to-day I shall soon be around which will be very acceptable&#8212;This is the first sickness I have ever had &amp; I find upon trial such things as faintness, headache &amp; trembling &amp; tossing all night, &amp; all day too, are not proper companions for a good union man like myself&#8212;</p>
            <p>Lewy, I dont know any news to send you&#8212;the acc'ts here to-night are that the railroad &amp; telegraph between Baltimore &amp; Washington are cut, &amp; also between Philadelphia by the rebel invasion<ptr target="nyp.00190_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>My dear boy, you say you would like to see me&#8212;well I would give any thing to see your face again too&#8212;I think of you often&#8212;tell Jo Harris &amp; Bartlett<ptr target="nyp.00190_n3"/> I have not forgotten them&#8212;</p>
            <p>And now good bye, Lewy, &amp; accept my heartfelt &amp; true love, my dearest comrade&#8212;&amp; I will try to write again before a great while &amp; tell you how I am getting along, &amp; which way I expect to move, &amp;c. And I hope you will do the same to me&#8212;</p>
            <p>So good bye again, Lew, &amp; God bless you, dear son, now &amp; through life&#8212;</p>
