               <salute>Dear mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Jeff's letter came informing me of the birth of the little girl,<ptr target="loc.00774_n1"/> &amp; that Matty was feeling pretty well, so far. I hope it will continue&#8212;Dear sister, I should much like to come home &amp; see you &amp; the little one, I am sure from Jeff's description it is a noble babe, &amp; as to its being a girl it is all the better. (I am not sure but the Whitman breed gives better women than men.)</p>
            <p>Well, mother, we are generally anticipating a lively time here or in the neighborhood,<ptr target="loc.00774_n2"/> as it is probable Lee is feeling about to strike a blow on Washington, or perhaps right into it&#8212;&amp; as Lee is no fool, it is perhaps possible he may give us a good shake&#8212;he is not very far off&#8212;yesterday was a fight to the southwest of here all day, we heard the cannons nearly all day&#8212;the wounded are arriving in small squads every day, mostly cavalry, a great many Ohio men&#8212;they send off to-day from the Washington hospitals a great many to New York, Philadelphia, &amp;c. all who are able, to make room, which looks ominous&#8212;indeed it is pretty certain that there is to be some severe fighting, may be a great battle again, the pending week&#8212;I am getting so callous that it hardly arouses me at all&#8212;I fancy I should take it very quietly if I found myself in the midst of a desperate conflict here in Washington.</p>
            <p>Mother, I have nothing particular to write about&#8212;I see &amp; hear nothing but new &amp; old cases of my poor suffering boys in Hospitals, &amp; I dare say you have had enough of such things&#8212;I have not missed a day at Hospital I think for more than three weeks&#8212;I get more &amp; more wound round&#8212;poor young men&#8212;there are some cases that would literally sink &amp; give up, if I did not pass a portion of the time with them&#8212;I have quite made up my mind about the lecturing &amp;c project&#8212;I have no doubt it will succeed well enough, the way I shall put it in operation&#8212;you know, mother, it is to raise funds to enable me to continue my Hospital ministrations, on a more free handed scale&#8212;As to the Sanitary Commissions &amp; the like, I am sick of them all, &amp; would not accept any of their berths&#8212;you ought to see the way the men as they lie helpless in bed turn away their faces from the sight of these Agents, Chaplains &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">hirelings</hi> as Elias Hicks<ptr target="loc.00774_n3"/> would call them&#8212;they seem to me always a set of foxes &amp; wolves)&#8212;they get well paid, &amp; are always incompetent &amp; disagreeable&#8212;As I told you before the only good fellows I have met are the Christian Commissioners&#8212;they go everywhere &amp; receive no pay<ptr target="loc.00774_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear, dear mother, I want much to see you &amp; dear Matty too, I send you both [my] best love, &amp; Jeff too&#8212;the pictures came&#8212;I have not heard from George nor Han. I write a day earlier than usual.</p>

            <p>We here think Vicksburgh is ours<ptr target="loc.00774_n5"/>&#8212;the probability is that it has capitulated&#8212;&amp; there has been no general assault&#8212;can't tell yet whether the 51st went there&#8212;we are having very fine weather here to-day&#8212;rained last night.</p>
