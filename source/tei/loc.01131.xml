            <p>I re<hi rend="superscript">cd</hi> both your cards,<ptr target="n0129"/> also the package of Tribunes with your letter.<ptr target="n0897"/> I happened to get the Tribune on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; so had seen the letter. It is re-printed in the Semi-Weekly edition also. I of course read it with deep interest. It is a noble eloquent letter &amp; has the old stirring ring. I like it immensely.</p>
            
            <p>I hope you have weathered

            this heated term, It has been tremendous here. We got our baby just as the heat began, July 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, &amp; we have had our hands full. He has been quite restless &amp; sleepless, &amp; we were both nearly worn out. He is doing better now &amp; we hope the worst is over. He is a bright little fellow &amp; I expect we shall "set a store" by him as the old women say</p>
            
            <p>The raspberries still hang on &amp; the currants too, but the best I can

            do now is to think of you when I eat them, which is three times a day. We have picked 2600 lbs of currants off that patch, &amp; there are several hundred there yet. Smith &amp; his family are well.</p>
            
            <p>The baby is lying on the lounge in my room as I write, I hear him nestle &amp; see that his eyes are open. So I must stop.</p>
            
            <p>Guernsey<ptr target="n0836"/> had a pleasant paragraph about you &amp; your Tribune letter in the Boston Herald. 'Sula sends love, so does the baby.<ptr target="n0892"/></p>
