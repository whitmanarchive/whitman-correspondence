            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> has told you about the
                "Surprise Party" he received on his birthday&#8212;the 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                inst!&#8212;I, myself, was unable to attend it, &#38; Hutton<ptr

                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02196.jpg" type="verso"/> One of our
                friends&#8212;W. Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>&#8212;contributed two songs (with
                choruses) of which I afterwards asked for copies. I received them today &#38; read
                them at noon for the first time. It occurred to me as I read them that they might
                possibly afford <hi rend="underline">you</hi> a slight momentary amusement, &#38; I
                will send them on with this.<ptr target="loc.04962_n1"/><pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02197.jpg"

                note the reference to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston's visit to you.</p>
            <p>One line saying that Dr. J. "triumphantly has shown us a hair from off your beard!"
                requires explanation. In a letter he received from you he saw (and appropriated) a
                white hair attached to the mucilage of the envelope.</p>

            <p>I hope that you are better than when you last wrote,<ptr target="n5005"/> and am anxious to hear a better
                report.</p>
            <p>The weather here has been very cold and frosty for a week back, and now threatens
                snow.</p>
