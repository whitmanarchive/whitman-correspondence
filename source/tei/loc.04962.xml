                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> has told you about the
                "Surprise Party" he received on his birthday&#8212;the 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                inst!&#8212;I, myself, was unable to attend it, + Hulton is away from home at
                present, but all the rest of the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium"
                    resp="#ktl">friends</unclear> were there + <unclear reason="illegible"
                    cert="medium" resp="#ktl">had</unclear> a "good time." <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.02196.jpg" type="verso"/> One of our friends&#8212;W.
                Dixon&#8212;contributed two songs (with choruses) of which I afterwards asked for
                copies. I received them today + read them at noon for the first time. It occurred to
                me as I read them that they might possibly afford <hi rend="underline">you</hi> a
                slight momentary amusement, + I will send them on with this.<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.02197.jpg" type="recto"/> As you will see, they haven't much merit
                or value but you will note the reference to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston's
                visit to you.</p>
            <p>One line saying that Dr. J. "triumphantly has shown us a hair from off your beard!"
                requires explanation. In a letter he received from you he saw (and appropriated) a
                white hair attached to the mucilage of the envelope.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02198.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I hope that you are better than when you last wrote, and am anxious to hear a better
                report.</p>
            <p>The weather here has been very cold and frosty for a week back, and now threatens
                snow.</p>
