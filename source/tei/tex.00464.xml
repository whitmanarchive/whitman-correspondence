                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>During the past day or two I have been arranging your portraits for the 'Scottish Art
                Review' (where they will probably appear in the May number), and at the same time I
                have been reading <hi rend="underline">November Boughs</hi><ptr target="n3999"/> with great
                delight—Mrs. Costelloe's<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> copy of the book! There
                is a double stimulus in your poems &amp; prose writings, now that I am able to read
                between the lines, feeling all the time as if I can still see you in your great
                arm-chair—as during my visits a year ago,—a never failing friendly
                presence behind the black-&amp;-white of the printed page. It is this impression that I
                must try to convey as far as may be in my article in the S. A. Review accompanying
                the portraits. —I wonder by the way whether Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/>
                would allow me to reproduce the photo. from his painting at the same time. Perhaps
                you will say a word to him about this?</p> 
            <p>Since coming back to London from my pleasant jaunt in South Wales—when I had a
                capital time of it in exploring Worm's Head &amp; the Gower coast,— <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="tex_ao.00013.jpg" type="verso"/>I have been grinding
                away pretty hard at mere literary work—more than I like indeed, for I want to
                be less &amp; less literary in the narrow sense henceforth, &amp; go in for expressing life
                direct rather than dealing with other people's books. This is a lesson of course
                that <hi rend="underline">L. of Grass</hi> teach me. So my instinct for life &amp; the
                open road grows stronger every day. "Right Jack Health!" as Keats said,<ptr target="tex.00464_n1"/>—Health
                before everything!</p>
            <p>Living in London need not mean any excess of mere <hi rend="underline">literariness</hi>, however. There's no such place for Life after all. Even New
                York has not such tumult—such human interplay &amp; variety. Everyday something
                new &amp; inspiring discovers itself in the familiar ways. This struck me in walking
                along the Embankment from Westminster to Waterloo Bridges this afternoon with the
                tide—higher than usual—just at the full; the river alive with various
                craft. The sight would have pleased you well.</p>
            <p>I believe I told you that my sister Edith<ptr target="n5001"/> was with me here. She is going in for
                music, &amp; at this moment is thundering away at Wagner's 'Flying Dutchman' on the
                piano. We called on Mrs. Costelloe the other day, &amp; found her very well. Edith quite
                fell in love with her.</p>
            <p>Getting dusk as I finish this just in time for post. Hope you are feeling better
                every way. Edith sends her love. Mine goes without saying. Remember me to all good friends.</p>
