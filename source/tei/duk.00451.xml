            <p>
                Han<ptr target="nyp.00207_n1"/> is not so well to day&#8212;but much cast down. Much disappointed, althought 
                appreciating her friends, Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> and Jessie's<ptr target="n1055"/>
                visit. She thinks as I do that they should have visited our home first and administered to its immediate urgent 
                necessities&#8212;taxes were due 24 dollars&#8212;which Han mentioned. On leaving Lou
                mentioned that Han should write to her, and she would send her all she needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now Walt, we need money most&#8212;taxes&#8212;then 1 ton of coal, 1 cord of wood, which Lou promise to pay for&#8212;coal 
                6&#8212;wood 4&#8212;for a stove which was set up<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="duk.00451.002_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                for Han in winter, but for which there is scarcely any use, as I keep a heater all the winter going, pipe
                traversing upper rooms&#8212;.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Han is apprehensive and cast down&#8212;dread glooming her 25 years pleasant home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cannot something, money be raised to relieve us of this present pressure? It seems incredible that I could 
                have sustaind ourselves so long, with so little derived professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Real estate inducements are advertised in Camden. I have written to the Agents&#8212;then Han would be near her family. 
                She often desires to be near you&#8212;living near You, Walt.
                She is cast down. No money was bestowed, our good true friend.
