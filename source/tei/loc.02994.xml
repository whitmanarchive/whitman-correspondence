                <salute>You dear (young) old F'ellow:<ptr target="loc.02994_n1"/>—</salute>
            </opener>   
            <p>I was just feeling to-day a lack in my soul—a gap—an idea that you had
                not been heard from—when—comes yr card.<ptr target="loc.02994_n2"/> I had no idea O'C.<ptr target="n2002"/> wd have 'fits' It seems terrible. The letter I sent
                    <choice><sic>Burrougs</sic><corr>Burroughs</corr></choice><ptr target="n0129"/> contained so cheery news that this last is an
                unpleasant surprise. Well this is the worst month in the year. Let us wait patiently
                for god's (nature's) grass &amp; dandelions again. Death is no evil to good or bad.</p>
            
            <p>I am reading Browning<ptr target="n0116"/> still; manage to extract considerable from his rubbish; he is a
                great fellow for subtle soul-searchings, &amp; delvings in the past. But I can't <hi rend="underline">heartily love</hi> any except <hi rend="underline">our</hi> kind of
                men—cheerful—the Scotts, George <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="high">Sa</unclear>nds,<ptr target="loc.02994_n3"/>
                Homer, Emerson,<ptr target="n0218"/> &amp;c. Browning deals in the sad &amp; horrible 
                almost—<gap reason="illegible" quantity="8" unit="chars" extent="1 word"/></p>
           
            <p>By the way, I am feeling deep sympahty <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02994.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>for poor Frank Sanborn.<ptr target="n0915"/> I suppose you saw the notice that his son—a promising 
                young fellow, 23 or so, committed suicide. Do you suppose it was love &amp; money combined—the
                cause—? He was writing a little for Springfield Republican. Sanborn père
                had a col. in that paper about him, giving extracts from his verse-poems. They
                were real pretty, unusually good, in some respects. Sanborn seems to be having a
                tough time these days. May his philosophy &amp; well stored literary mind stand him well
                now!</p>
            <p>Burroughs—has he gone into burrow? In one of his dark mumpish spells, think
                you? He don't answer me. I sent him a ply of new kind of wheat coffee some months
                ago &amp; got a good letter. I send him a Transcript occasionally, with horticultural report. (I can't realize that you
                have been shut up there so long. You are <hi rend="underline">a hero</hi>.
                 I tho't you never cd stand
                 it not to get to nature. Keep heart.)</p>
            <p>I continue at my typographical business</p> 
            <p>Hope I hear from Paisley<ptr target="n4318"/> in a fortnight</p>
