            <p>The hospitals here in &amp; around Washington are still pretty full, and contain in some respects the most needy cases of all the suffering&#8212;(though there are plenty such every where.) For the past few weeks I have been on a tour down to the front, through the division hospitals, especially those around Culpepper &amp; Brandy Station, mostly of the 1st, 2d, &amp; 3d corps, to see how the sick were situated there. A year ago I spent December &amp; part of January<ptr target="duk.00380_n2"/> (after 1st Fredericksburgh) among the wounded in front from Aquia Creek to Falmouth, and saw perhaps the saddest scenes of the war then. But there is nothing like it now. I have made up my mind that the camp hospitals are pretty well cleaned out, the worst cases are here in Washington, &amp; so I have returned here for good.<ptr target="duk.00380_n3"/> In the field hospitals I find diarrhea, getting more &amp; more prevalent, &amp; chronic. It is the great disease of the army. The doctors, as always, give too much medicine, &amp; hold on to the poor young men in camp too long, then when the thing is deeply rooted, send them up here. How many such wrecks of young men have I seen, from boat &amp; railroad, from front, come crawling pale &amp; faint along here, many to linger a while, &amp; die, during the past year, sent up in this way after being kept too long.</p>
            <p>I suppose you will be interested in knowing that our troops in the field in Virginia are this Winter remarkably well in health, however, as a general thing &amp; in the cheeriest temper. They have better houses than ever before, no shelter tents now, but huts of logs &amp; mud, with fireplaces. In the tour I allude to, I was much in contact with the rank in file, lived among them in their camps, among the common soldiers &amp; teamsters, &amp;c. I never go among the Army in this way, but what, after making all allowances, I feel that our general stock of young men shows all other races, meagre &amp; pale &amp; puny in comparison. The more I see of them in the Army, the higher &amp; broader my estimate of them. (I mean the Americans, I dont make account of any other&#8212;Americans both West &amp; East, &amp; from all the agricultural regions of the great states). And then to be among them also as I have been for past fifteen months, among them, seeing them in hospitals, thousands, so young &amp; manly, with such fearful suffering, wounds, amputations, &amp; weary sickness. O how one gets to love them&#8212;indeed it brings people very, very close, such circumstances.</p>
            <p>As to the temper of the Army in Virginia, I should say it was never so resolute, so full of the right spirit for endurance &amp; work as it is to-day. The filled-up regiments, gathering around the nucleus of the old veterans, make better regiments than any. I was with several such, &amp; found them excellent. These re-enlisted regiments, returning from their furloughs, thus filled up, are streaming down to front fast already. The opinion of Meade is full of respect for him&#8212;he is thought an earnest, alert, concientious, cautious commander.</p>
            <p>I write these, doctor, thinking they may interest you, coming from late direct contact with the army on the ground.</p>
         <p>So, doctor, I still remain here in Washington, occupying my time nearly altogether among the wounded &amp; sick, as when I last wrote you.<ptr target="duk.00380_n4"/> I act as an independent visitor &amp; helper among the men, fixing as before on the cases that most need. I never miss a single day or night, week day or Sunday, visiting some poor, young soul in bodily &amp; mental tribulation. It is a great privilege to me, more to me than to them I think.<ptr target="duk.00380_n100"/>
