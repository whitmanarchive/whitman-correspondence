                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received the "Camden Post" on Tuesday morning, the 26th inst, and in the evening of
                the same day I received the "Camden Morning News"&#8212;the "screed" from "The
                Critic"&#8212;and your post card&#8212;in reply to which latter I wired to you at
                once.&#8212;</p>


            <p>It isn't possible for me to write much at present. I have read all the pieces you
                    sent&#8212;especially<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02165.jpg" type="verso"
                /> the letter to "The Critic."&#8212;It suggests some points I should like to write
                about, but I must only note <hi rend="underline">one</hi>&#8212;and that is your
                remark that you are "still rejected by the great magazines" +c.&#8212;Well&#8212;so
                much the worse for <hi rend="underline">them</hi>! It is only of a piece with your
                continued rejection by some of your leading men of letters and the absurdly
                inadequate recognition of those who seem friendly.&#8212;I could wish it were
                otherwise,&#8212;and that the solitude of soul in which you have lived might at
                last, in your old age, be cheered by the<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.02166.jpg" type="recto"/> advent of a completely intelligent +
                loving recognition + response. That you are still, in a great degree, "despised +
                rejected of men" is, however, only the price you pay for your greatness, and
                corresponds with the experience of other great benefactors + redeemers.&#8212;But
                there is a wise encompassing Love which transcends all our thinking&#8212;"Love like
                the light silently wrapping all"&#8212;which holds both yourself + your work in safe
                and tender keeping&#8212;Future generations will love you all the more passionately
                for your rejection by your contemporaries, and we who have already come to partly
                understand you and to love you<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02167.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> also love you more proudly and tenderly because of it.</p>
            <p>Your great kindness&#8212;most fatherly, most tender&#8212;to D<hi rend="underline"
                    >r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> + myself stirs my heart more deeply than I
                can tell you. We thought it a precious privilege to minister, in however slight a
                degree to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, and, behold! you <hi rend="underline"
                    >load</hi> us in return with the most unlooked for and unmerited kindnesses!
                Thanks to you from my heart&#8212;and God bless you!</p>




            <p>I cannot write more now but I think I will send you a slip I cut from a newspaper
                last Decbr. I thought of sending it to you at the time + will now do so.&#8212;</p>
