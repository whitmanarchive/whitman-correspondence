        <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I wrote you a short &amp; very hurried letter last night, only a few minutes before the mail closed—
        To-day Mrs. O'Connor has just paid me a pleasant visit—&amp; I have been eating my lunch 
        of a roast apple &amp; biscuit—I am feeling about the same—I suppose you are most tired, 
        and perhaps a little suspicious of hearing I am "<hi rend="italic">about the same</hi>"—
        Well I am quite tired myself, &amp; want much to get out, &amp; go to work, &amp; go about—
        But I just have to make the best of it, &amp; console myself with realizing 
        that disagreeable as it is, it might be a great deal worse—&amp; that I am 
        feeling free from pain &amp; comparatively comforting, &amp; that it cannot be <hi rend="italic">very long</hi> 
        before I shall have the good use of my limbs again—So I just try to keep patient 
        &amp; wait—&amp; you must too, dearest mother—
      </p>
      
      <p>I got a good letter from Hattie to-day, dated March 9<ptr target="nyp.00315_n1"/>—she says she was writing to you—
        so I suppose you have one too—They seem to like it at Mr &amp; Mrs. Buckley's.<ptr target="nyp.00315_n2"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>Mother, I got your letter of Monday and Lou's of Sunday<ptr target="nyp.00315_n3"/>—it is an affection of the leg from the knee downward, partially helpless—
        but the principal trouble is yet in the head, &amp; so easily getting fatigued—
        my whole body feels heavy, &amp; sometimes my hand—Still, I go out a little 
        every day almost—accompanied by Peter, or some one—sometimes spend an hour out, 
        but cannot walk, except a very little indeed, very slowly indeed—
        Mother, in <hi rend="italic">my looks</hi> you would hardly know the least thing had been the matter with me—
        I am neither pale nor thin in the least—
      </p>
      
      <p rend="right">Friday forenoon <lb/>March 14.
      </p>
      
      <p>I am sitting here in my room—it is very pleasant out apparently—
        I generally go out a little between two &amp; three, and shall 
        probably get out a little this afternoon—
      </p>
      
      <p>John Burroughs has been on here again—he is trying to sell or let his house, 
        &amp; does not succeed very satisfactorily—he left here again by the train last evening 
        &amp; returned north—his wife is here—Mother, I send the Harper's Weekly—
        that picture gives a very good idea of the Capitol, (what they call the east front)—
        in the Extra is a picture of the inauguration ball—very good, 
        they say—you must look over them Sunday—
      </p>
      
      <p>Well, mother dear, it is now after 12—I expect to get out 
        a little from 2 to 3—Love to you &amp; to Lou &amp; George &amp; all.
      </p>
