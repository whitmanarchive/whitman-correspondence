        <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I wrote you a short &amp; very hurried letter last night, only a few minutes before the mail closed&#8212;
        To-day Mrs. O'Connor has just paid me a pleasant visit&#8212;&amp; I have been eating my lunch 
        of a roast apple &amp; biscuit&#8212;I am feeling about the same&#8212;I suppose you are most tired, 
        and perhaps a little suspicious of hearing I am "<hi rend="italic">about the same</hi>"&#8212;
        Well I am quite tired myself, &amp; want much to get out, &amp; go to work, &amp; go about&#8212;
        But I just have to make the best of it, &amp; console myself with realizing 
        that disagreeable as it is, it might be a great deal worse&#8212;&amp; that I am 
        feeling free from pain &amp; comparatively comforting, &amp; that it cannot be <hi rend="italic">very long</hi> 
        before I shall have the good use of my limbs again&#8212;So I just try to keep patient 
        &amp; wait&#8212;&amp; you must too, dearest mother&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>I got a good letter from Hattie to-day, dated March 9<ptr target="nyp.00315_n1"/>&#8212;she says she was writing to you&#8212;
        so I suppose you have one too&#8212;They seem to like it at Mr &amp; Mrs. Buckley's.<ptr target="nyp.00315_n2"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>Mother, I got your letter of Monday and Lou's of Sunday<ptr target="nyp.00315_n3"/>&#8212;it is an affection of the leg from the knee downward, partially helpless&#8212;
        but the principal trouble is yet in the head, &amp; so easily getting fatigued&#8212;
        my whole body feels heavy, &amp; sometimes my hand&#8212;Still, I go out a little 
        every day almost&#8212;accompanied by Peter, or some one&#8212;sometimes spend an hour out, 
        but cannot walk, except a very little indeed, very slowly indeed&#8212;
        Mother, in <hi rend="italic">my looks</hi> you would hardly know the least thing had been the matter with me&#8212;
        I am neither pale nor thin in the least&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p rend="right">Friday forenoon <lb/>March 14.
      </p>
      
      <p>I am sitting here in my room&#8212;it is very pleasant out apparently&#8212;
        I generally go out a little between two &amp; three, and shall 
        probably get out a little this afternoon&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>John Burroughs has been on here again&#8212;he is trying to sell or let his house, 
        &amp; does not succeed very satisfactorily&#8212;he left here again by the train last evening 
        &amp; returned north&#8212;his wife is here&#8212;Mother, I send the Harper's Weekly&#8212;
        that picture gives a very good idea of the Capitol, (what they call the east front)&#8212;
        in the Extra is a picture of the inauguration ball&#8212;very good, 
        they say&#8212;you must look over them Sunday&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>Well, mother dear, it is now after 12&#8212;I expect to get out 
        a little from 2 to 3&#8212;Love to you &amp; to Lou &amp; George &amp; all.
      </p>
