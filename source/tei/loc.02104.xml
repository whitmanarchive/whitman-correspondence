            <p>
               Your card of the 27th of September<ptr target="loc.02104_n4"/> reached me along with the parcels of books. Thanks
               many &#38; hearty for your prompt attention to my requests, dear Walt Whitman. The big
               Bible for my boy will "go home," I feel certain. Your inscription in it is beautiful;
               and the lad will value the book more and more as
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02104.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
               he grows older. I should have judged from the vigour and firmness of the writing that
               you had taken a start for the better; but I must not assume more than the
               words of your card authorize,
               "right arm, mentality, and fair
               spirits." The Sculptor's profile<ptr target="loc.02104_n6"/> for
               "Goodbye my Fancy"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> is very impressive and grand.
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02104.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                The parcels contained 1 Complete Works,<ptr target="n4195"/> 2 "Good-Bye my Fancy,"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> 1 "As a Strong Bird,"<ptr target="n0746b"/>
                1 Burroughs,<ptr target="loc.02104_n5"/> 1 "Democratic Vistas,"<ptr target="n4122"/> &#38; 1 "Gras-halme."<ptr target="loc.07240_n2"/> You say more to follow,
                "especially new issue of Leaves"<ptr target="loc.04811_n6"/>: of this last I am very glad, &#38; hope you will
                write in it for me; but I think that will use up the money I sent, in all probability;
                so I send some more. What I wanted "Democratic
                Vistas," "As a Strong Bird," "Passage to India,"<ptr target="n0465b"/> &#38; "After All"<ptr target="n0027b"/> for 
                was to have <hi rend="underline">inscribed</hi>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02104.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                copies from you. If you conclude to indulge me you can still send them against
                the present remittance; and I should like, besides, the cloth covered &#38;
                inscribed "Good-Bye," six more of the unbound copies like the 2 you sent. Then
                I should be glad of another lot of "Portraits Well-Enveloped"<ptr target="loc.02104_n7"/> such as I had
                a year or so ago, and one or two spare "sculptor's profiles." Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>
                says you like doing these little business matters &#38;
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02104.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>    
                hearing direct from us now &#38; again. But if I worry you with my minutiae
                you need not take any notice of me.</p>
            <p>
                Next parcel might contain with advantage one or two facsimiles of your birthday
                bulletin<ptr target="loc.02104_n3"/> to Dr. Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/>; and finally, if you advise me of dispatch,
                will you
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02104.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                this time do so on one of the yellow bits of paper (enclosed) instead of a card?
                Not that I object to cards, but (as you will suspect) because I want a
                note from you on the yellow sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am providing the next generation with lots of beautiful relics of you. My
                collection of them is a great pleasure
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02104.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                to me, and when I "go under" some other fellow or fellows will have the
                advantage of them.
