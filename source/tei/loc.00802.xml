               <salute>Dear son &amp; comrade,<ptr target="loc.00802_n2"/> | &amp; all my dear comrades in the hospital,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I sit down this pleasant Sunday forenoon intending to write you all a good stout letter, to try to amuse you as I am not able at present to visit you, like I did&#8212;yet what I shall write about I hardly know until I get started&#8212;but, my dear comrades, I wish to help you pass away the time, for a few minutes any how&#8212;I am now home at my mother's in Brooklyn, N Y&#8212;I am in good health as ever &amp; eat my rations without missing one time&#8212;Lew, I wish you was here with me, &amp; I wish my dear comrade Elijah Fox<ptr target="loc.00802_n3"/> in Ward G was here with me&#8212;but perhaps he is on his way to Wisconsin&#8212;Lewy, I came through from Washington to New York by day train, 2d Nov., had a very pleasant trip, every thing went lovely, &amp; I got home in the evening between 8 and 9&#8212;Next morning I went up to the polls bright &amp; early&#8212;I suppose it is not necessary to tell you how I voted&#8212;we have gained a great victory in this city&#8212;it went union this time, though it went democratic strong only a year ago, &amp; for many years past&#8212;&amp; all through the state the election was a very big thing for the union&#8212;I tell you the copperheads got flaxed out handsomely<ptr target="loc.00802_n4"/>&#8212;indeed these late elections are about as great a victory for us as if we had flaxed General Lee himself, &amp; all his men&#8212;&amp; as for personal good will I feel as if I could have more for Lee or any of his fighting men, than I have for the northern copperheads&#8212;</p>
            <p>Lewy, I was very glad to get your letter of the 5th&#8212;I want you to tell Oscar Cunningham<ptr target="loc.00802_n5"/> in your ward that I sent him my love &amp; he must try to keep up good courage while he is confined there with his wound. Lewy, I want you to give my love to Charley Cate<ptr target="loc.00802_n6"/> &amp; all the boys in Ward K, &amp; to Benton<ptr target="loc.00802_n7"/> if he is [there still]&#8212;I wish you would go in Ward C and see James S Stilwell,<ptr target="loc.00802_n8"/> &amp; also Thomas Carson<ptr target="loc.00802_n9"/> in same ward, &amp; Chambers<ptr target="loc.00802_n10"/> that lays next to him, &amp; tell them I sent them my love. Give Carson this letter to read if he wishes it. Tell James Stilwell I have writ from here to his folks at Comac, L. I., &amp; it may be I shall go down there next week on the L I railroad; &amp; let him have this letter to read if he wishes it&#8212;Tell Manvill Winterstein<ptr target="loc.00802_n11"/> that lays next to him in Ward C that I send him my love, &amp; I hope his wound is healing good. Lew, I wish you to go in Ward B and tell a young cavalry man, his first name is Edwin,<ptr target="loc.00802_n12"/> he is wounded in the right arm, that I sent him my love, &amp; on the opposite side a young man named Charley<ptr target="loc.00802_n13"/> wounded in left hand, &amp; Jennings,<ptr target="loc.00802_n14"/> &amp; also a young man I love that lays now up by the door just above Jennings, that I sent them all my love. So, Lew, you see I am giving you a good round job, with so many messages&#8212;but I want you to do them all, dear son, &amp; leave my letter with each of the boys that wish it, to read for themselves&#8212;tell Miss Gregg<ptr target="loc.00802_n15"/> in Ward A that I send my love to Pleasant Borley,<ptr target="loc.00802_n16"/> if he is still there, &amp; if so I hope it will be God's will that he will live &amp; get strong to go home yet&#8212;I send my love to little Billy,<ptr target="loc.00802_n17"/> the Ohio boy in Ward A, &amp; to Miss Gregg herself&#8212;&amp; if Mrs Doolittle is in Ward B, please ask her to tell the boys in the ward I sent them my love, &amp; to her too, &amp; give her this letter some evening to read to the boys, &amp; one of these days I will come back &amp; read to them myself&#8212;&amp; the same to Mrs Southwick in Ward H, if she wishes to read it to the boys for my sake.</p>
            <p>Lew, I wish you would go in Ward G &amp; find a very dear friend of mine in bed 11, Elijah D Fox, if he is still there. Tell him I sent him my best love, &amp; that I make reckoning of meeting him again, &amp; that he must not forget me, though that I know he never will&#8212;I want to hear how he is, &amp; whether he has got his papers through yet&#8212;Lewy, I wish you would go to him first &amp; let him have this letter to read if he is there&#8212;Lewy, I would like you to give my love to a young man named Burns in Ward I, &amp; to all the boys in Ward I&#8212;&amp; indeed in every ward, from A to K inclusive, &amp; all through the hospital, as I find I cannot particularize without being tedious&#8212;so I send my love sincerely to each &amp; all, for every sick &amp; wounded soldier is dear to me as a son or brother, &amp; furthermore every man that wears the union uniform &amp; sticks to it like a man, is to me a dear comrade, &amp; I will do what I can for him though it may not be much&#8212;&amp; I will add that my mother &amp; all my folks feel just the same about it, &amp; would show it by their works too when they can&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, dear comrades, what shall I tell you to pass away the time? I am going around quite a great deal, more than I really desire to. Two or three nights ago I went to the N Y Academy of Music, to the Italian opera.<ptr target="loc.00802_n18"/> I suppose you know that is a performance, a play, all in music &amp; singing, in the Italian language, very sweet &amp; beautiful. There is a large company of singers &amp; a large band, altogether two or three hundred. It is in a splendid great house, four or five tiers high, &amp; a broad parquette on the main floor. The opera here now has some of the greatest singers in the world&#8212;the principal lady singer (her name is Medori) has a voice that would make you hold your breath with wonder &amp; delight, it is like a miracle&#8212;no mocking bird nor the clearest flute can begin with it&#8212;besides it is [a] very rich &amp; strong voice&#8212;&amp; besides she is a tall &amp; handsome lady, &amp; her actions are so graceful as she moves about the stage, playing her part. Boys, I must tell you just one scene in the opera I saw&#8212;things have worked so in the piece that this lady is compelled, although she tries very hard to avoid it, to give a cup of poisoned wine to her lover&#8212;the king her husband forces her to do it&#8212;she pleads hard, but her husband threatens to take both their lives (all this is in singing &amp; music, very fine)&#8212;so the lover is brought in as a prisoner, &amp; the king pretends to pardon him &amp; make up, &amp; asks the young man to drink a cup of wine, &amp; orders the lady to pour it out. The lover drinks it, then the king gives her &amp; him a look, &amp; smiles &amp; walks off the stage. And now came as good a piece of performance as I ever saw in my life. The lady as soon as she saw that her husband was really gone, she sprang to her lover, clutched him by the arm, &amp; poured out the greatest singing you ever heard&#8212;it poured like a raging river more than any thing else I could compare it to&#8212;she tells him he is poisoned&#8212;he tries to inquire &amp;c and hardly knows what to make of it&#8212;she breaks in, trying to pacify him, &amp; explain &amp;c&#8212;all this goes on very rapid indeed, &amp; the band accompanying&#8212;she quickly draws out from her bosom a little vial, to neutralize the poison, then the young man in his desperation abuses her &amp; tells her perhaps it is to poison him still more as she has already poisoned him once&#8212;this puts her in such agony, she begs &amp; pleads with him to take the antidote at once before it is too late&#8212;her voice is so wild &amp; high it goes through one like a knife, yet it is delicious&#8212;she holds the little vial to his mouth with one hand &amp; with the other springs open a secret door in the wall, for him to escape from the palace&#8212;he swallows the antidote, &amp; as she pushes him through the door, the husband returns with some armed guards, but she slams the door to, &amp; stands back up against the door, &amp; her arms spread wide open across it, one fist clenched, &amp; her eyes glaring like a wild cat, so they dare not touch her&#8212;&amp; that ends the scene. Comrades, recollect all this is in singing &amp; music, &amp; lots of it too, on a big scale, in the band, every instrument you can think of, &amp; the best players in the world, &amp; sometimes the whole band &amp; the whole men's chorus &amp; women's chorus all putting on the steam together&#8212;&amp; all in a vast house, light as day, &amp; with a crowded audience of ladies &amp; men. Such singing &amp; strong rich music always give me the greatest pleasure&#8212;&amp; so the opera is the only amusement I have gone to, for my own satisfaction, for last ten years.</p>
            <p>But, my dear comrades, I will now tell you something about my own folks&#8212;home here there is quite a lot of us&#8212;my father is not living&#8212;my dear mother is very well indeed for her age, which is 67&#8212;she is cheerful &amp; hearty, &amp; still does all her light housework &amp; cooking&#8212;She never tires of hearing about the soldiers, &amp; I sometimes think she is the greatest patriot I ever met, one of the old stock&#8212;I believe she would cheerfully give her life for the Union, if it would avail any thing&#8212;and the last mouthful in the house to any union soldier that needed it<ptr target="loc.00802_n19"/>&#8212;then I have a very excellent sister-in-law&#8212;she has two fine young ones&#8212;so I am very happy in the women &amp; family arrangements. Lewy, the brother I mentioned as sick, lives near here, he is very poorly indeed, &amp; I fear will never be much better<ptr target="loc.00802_n20"/>&#8212;he too was a soldier, has for several months had throat disease&#8212;he is married &amp; has a family&#8212;I believe I have told you of still another brother in the army, down in the 9th Army Corps, has been in the service over two years, he is very rugged &amp; healthy&#8212;has been in many battles, but only once wounded, at first Fredericksburgh.</p>
            <p>Monday forenoon November 9.
Dear comrades, as I did not finish my letter yesterday afternoon, as I had many friends come to see me, I will finish it now&#8212;the news this morning is that Meade is shoving Lee back upon Richmond, &amp; that we have already given the rebs some hard knocks, there on the old Rappahannock fighting ground. O I do hope the Army of the Potomac will at last gain a first-class victory, for they have had to retreat often enough, &amp; yet I believe a better Army never trod the earth than they are &amp; have been for over a year.</p>
            <p>Well, dear comrades, it looks so different here in all this mighty city, every thing going with a big rush &amp; so gay, as if there was neither war nor hospitals in the land. New York &amp; Brooklyn appear nothing but prosperity &amp; plenty. Every where carts &amp; trucks &amp; carriages &amp; vehicles on the go, loaded with goods, express-wagons, omnibuses, cars, &amp;c&#8212;thousands of ships along the wharves, &amp; the piers piled high, where they are loading or unloading the cargoes&#8212;all the stores crammed with every thing you can think of, &amp; the markets with all sorts of provisions&#8212;tens &amp; hundreds of thousands of people every where, (the population is 1,500,000), almost every body well-drest, &amp; appearing to have enough&#8212;then the splendid river &amp; harbor here, full of ships, steamers, sloops, &amp;c&#8212;then the great street, Broadway, for four miles, one continual jam of people, &amp; the great magnificent stores all along on each side, &amp; the show windows filled with beautiful &amp; costly goods&#8212;I never saw the crowd thicker, nor such goings on &amp; such prosperity&#8212;&amp; as I passed through Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia it seemed to be just the same.</p>
            <p>I am quite fond of crossing on the Fulton ferry, or South ferry, between Brooklyn &amp; New York, on the big handsome boats. They run continually day &amp; night. I know most of the pilots, &amp; I go up on deck &amp; stay as long as I choose. The scene is very curious, &amp; full of variety. The shipping along the wharves looks like a forest of bare trees. Then there are all classes of sailing vessels &amp; steamers, some of the grandest &amp; most beautiful steamships in the world, going or coming from Europe, or on the California route, all these on the move. As I sit up there in the pilot house, I can see every thing, &amp; the distant scenery, &amp; away down toward the sea, &amp; Fort Lafayette &amp;c. The ferry boat has to pick its way through the crowd. Often they hit each other, then there is a time&#8212;</p>
            <p>My loving comrades, I am scribbling all this in my room in my mother's house. It is Monday forenoon&#8212;I have now been home about a week in the midst of relations, &amp; many friends, many young men, some I have known from childhood, many I love very much. I am out quite a good deal, as we are glad to be with each other&#8212;they have entertainments &amp;c. But truly, my dear comrades, I never sit down, not a single time, to the bountiful dinners &amp; suppers to which I am taken in this land of wealth &amp; plenty without feeling it would be such a comfort to all, if you too, my dear &amp; loving boys, could have each your share of the good things to eat &amp; drink, &amp; of the pleasure &amp; amusement. My friends among the young men make supper parties, after which there is drinking &amp;c., every thing prodigal &amp; first rate, one, Saturday night, &amp; another last night&#8212;it is much pleasure, yet often in the midst of the profusion, the palatable dishes to eat, &amp; the laughing &amp; talking, &amp; liquors &amp;c, my thoughts silently turn to Washington, to all who lie there sick &amp; wounded, with bread &amp; molasses for supper&#8212;</p>
            <p>Lewy, dear son, I think I shall remain here ten or twelve days longer, &amp; then I will try to be with you once again. If you feel like it I would like to have you write me soon, tell me about the boys, especially James Stilwell, Pleasant Borley, Cunningham, &amp; from the cavalry boy Edwin in ward B&#8212;tell me whether Elijah Fox in ward G has gone home&#8212;Lew, when you write to Tom Sawyer<ptr target="loc.00802_n21"/> you know what to say from me&#8212;he is one I love in my heart, &amp; always shall till death, &amp; afterwards too&#8212;I wish you to tell a young man in ward D, 2d bed below the middle door, (his first name is Isaac,<ptr target="loc.00802_n22"/> he is wounded in left leg, &amp; it has had erysipelas), that I sent him my love, &amp; I wish him to have this letter to read if he desires it, &amp; I will see him again before long.</p>
            <p>So, Lew, I have given you a lot of messages but you can take your time to do them, only I wish each of the boys I have mentioned to have my letter that wishes it, &amp; read it at leisure for themselves, &amp; then pass to another. If Miss Hill in ward F or the lady nurse in ward E cares about reading it to the boys in those wards for my sake, you give it them some evening, as I know the boys would like to hear from me, as I do from them.</p>
            <p>Well, Lewy, I must bid you good bye for present, dear son, &amp; also to all the rest of my dear comrades, &amp; I pray God to bless you, my darling boys, &amp; I send you all my love, &amp; I hope it will be so ordered to let things go as easy as possible with all my dear boys wounded or sick, &amp; I hope it will be God's will that we shall all meet again, my dear loving comrades, not only here but hereafter.</p>
