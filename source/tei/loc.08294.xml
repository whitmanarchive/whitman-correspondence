            <p>I am staying here with H. Buxton Forman.<ptr target="n0240"/> Have been here 3 days now and shall remain 
                <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> about this day week. Go then to make a little visit 
                with Alfred <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#lc" cert="low">Withers</unclear><ptr target="n5001"/> who is also a very good 
                friend of yours but not as crazy about

			    you as some of us are! I have spent this whole day in the house&#8212;there was nothing especial to do 
			    outside so I worked at the lecture which I have to give in Montreal<ptr target="loc.08440_n5"/> (to the students there) abt. 1 Oct. 
			    I have got the lecture now pretty well under way&#8212;I saw Mrs Costelloe<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> day 
                before yesterday for a few minutes on the street&#8212;I was going to call on her and met her&#8212;the 
                same day I saw Mr Costelloe<ptr target="n6114"/> for an hour on meter business. I am to see him and some 
                other parties tomorrow about the meter. I hope to see Mr<ptr target="n4979"/> &amp; Mrs Smith<ptr target="n6170"/> 
                in the course of a week or two and to call on Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> from there.<ptr target="loc.08294_n1"/> I am to go to 
                Mrs Costelloes to dinner tomorrow evening and expect to meet with Alys<ptr target="n7014"/> there. 
                I saw a letter from Mr Smith to a friend the other day in which he spoke quite warmly of you so I guess if 
                he does not write it is only from want of time<ptr target="loc.07962_n1b"/>&#8212;or
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jm.00396.jpg" type="recto"/>
			    perhaps his sight is too bad to write much. Any way I will let you know all about it later. I am enjoying my 
			    visit here and am feeling first class&#8212;but I shall not be glad to get back to America &amp; Canada 
			    again when the time comes. I would rather be closer to you and other dear friends. Best love to you dear Walt from your friend</p>
