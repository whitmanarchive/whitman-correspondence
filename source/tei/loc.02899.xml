                Children of Adam though as he says, you do "smoke pretty strong tobacco" [!] in
                those poems. He finds "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" the finest, tenderest

            <p> The first three chapters attempt to once &#38; for all set at rest the uncertainty
                as to the purity &#38; supreme worth of Leaves of Grass, &#38; the greatness of W.
                W. as a man &#38; author. They form a tremendous eulogium, &#38; seem to me to be
                exhaustive &#38; unanswerable. </p>
            <p> The next three chapters are interpretative &#38; analytical chiefly. </p>

            <p> But I must stop &#38; get to work on it. For serious interruptions are looming up in
                the near future. A publisher buttonholed me in Boston yesterday. </p>
