               <salute>Dear boy &amp; comrade,<ptr target="duk.00531_n100"/>
            </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I rec'd your letter of the 9th<ptr target="duk.00531_n2"/>—&amp; am real glad to hear from you, &amp; that you are well &amp; in good spirits, as appears by your letter. You speak how much you would like to see me, &amp; we could be together a while. I too, dear friend, would be so glad if we were near each other where we could have each other's company often.</p>
            <p>I am still working here in the same office—We have lately a new Attorney General<ptr target="duk.00531_n3"/>—One of the first things he did was to <hi rend="italic">promote me</hi>!—Sensible man, wasn't he?—May the Lord reward him. I have been absent on leave the past summer two months—went to New York—spent most of the time with my mother, in Brooklyn—I have been well since I last wrote to you, mostly—only the last six weeks have had rather a bad time with neuralgia—but am getting over it.</p>
            <p>Things with friend Hiram Frazee<ptr target="duk.00531_n4"/> have gone poorly. He went from Harewood hospital here, to Brooklyn, to the City Hospital there—he had a terrific operation there that nearly cost him his life, &amp; after all did no good—it was a pay hospital, &amp; his stay in it cost him $300—The last I heard of Frazee was about two months ago—he was then home—his address is <hi rend="italic">Hiram W. Frazee, Camden, Oneida Co. New York</hi>—he wrote me, &amp; said he was as comfortable as one in his condition could be—he spoke about you in his letter, &amp; wanted much to know about you—</p>
            <p>Wood I have not heard from.</p>
            <p>Here in Washington Congress is in session, &amp; rather lively times—I suppose you see the acc'ts in the papers.</p>
            <p>Dear Comrade, you don't give me the particulars what you are doing, &amp;c. you must, when you write again—you speak of not being overburdened with green backs, &amp; profits &amp;c.—Well, boy, one can bear that, if one only keeps hearty &amp; fat &amp; in good spirits, as I guess you are.</p>
            <p>Well, I keep about as stout as ever, and my face red &amp; great beard just the same as when I used to see you—I eat my rations every time, too—I am writing this in the office by a big window with a splendid view of the Potomac &amp; Arlington Heights—Well I find I must close—I send my love to you, darling boy, &amp; I want you always to keep me posted wherever you go, dear Comrade.</p>
