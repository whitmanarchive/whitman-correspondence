            <p>Real glad to hear from you once more, as by yours of 18th&#8212;The death of Mrs:
                Gilchrist is indeed a gloomy fact&#8212;she had cancer, &#38; suffered much the last
                three months of her life with asthma&#8212;for a long time "every breath was a
                struggle," Herbert expresses it&#8212;the actual cause of death was dilatation of
                the heart. Seems to me mortality never enclosed a more beautiful spirit&#8212;</p>
            <p>The trouble ab't my eyesight passed over, &#38; I use both eyes now same as
                before&#8212;I am living here, rather monotonously, but get along&#8212;as I write,
                feel ab't the same as of late years&#8212;only the walking power seems quite gone
                from me, I can hardly get from one room to another&#8212;sometimes quite force
                myself to get out a few yards, but difficult &#38; risky&#8212;</p>
            <p>O'Connor seems to be holding on at Washington&#8212;I think he is middling well,
                except the leg power&#8212;his "gelatine legs" he calls them&#8212;will pass over I
                rather think&#8212;</p>
            <p>I drove down yesterday (Sunday) to my friends the Staffords, 10 miles from here,
                &#38; staid three hours, had dinner &#38;c&#8212;I go <hi rend="italic">there</hi> every Sunday&#8212;So I
                get stirr'd up some, but not half enough&#8212;three reasons, my natural
                sluggishness &#38; the paralysis of late years, the weather, &#38; my old, stiff,
                slow horse, with a lurking propensity to stumble down&#8212;</p>
            <p>The "free will offering" of the English, through Rossetti, has amounted in the past
                year to over $400&#8212;I am living on it&#8212;I get a miserable return of
                royalties from McKay, my Philad. publisher&#8212;<hi rend="italic">not $50 for both
                    books L of G. and S D for the past year</hi><ptr target="nyp.00543_n2"
                />&#8212;</p>
            <p>John, I like <hi rend="italic">both the names</hi> in your note&#8212;I cannot
                choose&#8212;if I lean at all it is in favor of "Spring Relish"<ptr
                    target="nyp.00543_n3"/>&#8212;either would be first rate&#8212;Did you get W S
                Kennedy's pamphlet "the Poet as a Craftsman"<ptr target="nyp.00543_n4"/>&#8212;I
                hear from Dr Bucke quite often&#8212;he was the past season somewhat broken in
                physical stamina &#38; health&#8212;but is better&#8212;he gives up for the present
                his European tour, but is coming here soon for a week&#8212;As I close, my bird is
                singing like a house afire, &#38; the sun is shining out&#8212;I wish you were here
                to spend the day with me&#8212;</p>
