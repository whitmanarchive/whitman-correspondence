                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I write to you, though personally unknown, as writing to a dear friend: because,
                though happy to call many about me by the name of friends, I have no truer friend
                than yourself: if friendship means the receiving of light and delight and strength
                from the spirit of a brother man. I have lived as yet but eighteen years: yet in all
                the constant thoughts and acts of my last few years, your words have been my guides
                and true oracles. I cannot hope to see you face to face, and tell <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02367.002.jpg" type="verso"/> you this: but
                you will at least believe it and feel that I am not writing from an unworthy spirit
                of self-assertion: but that I should feel shame for myself, were I not to show the
                reality of my gratitude to you, even through the weakness of words&#8212;you, whom I
                thankfully acknowledge for my veritable master and dear brother. </p>
            <p> You, in your age and glorious approach to the sure future of death&#8212;you will
                know that I am speaking neither empty adulation nor shallow shams. </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02367.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p> I am proud of belonging to the oldest school of any in England&#8212;to the great
                foundation of the strong priest and ruler, William of Wykeham: and it was under the
                shadows of the ancient walls of his college, still flourishing through the influence
                of his powerful personality, that I first received "Leaves of Grass" from the hands
                of a most dear friend. And the help and exaltation that I won from it have been won
                by many another boy and young man, of those in whose hands rests the immediate
                history of the coming <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02367.004.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> years&#8212;to make it splendid with strong actions and strong
                asserted truths. It is in your works, as in the great powers of earth and sea, that
                the inspiring force of no school is to be found: certain to dare all things by the
                strength of body and soul inseparable. </p>
            <p> Whether I am right or not in writing to you, I neither know nor care: I do know that
                I cannot keep silence.</p>
