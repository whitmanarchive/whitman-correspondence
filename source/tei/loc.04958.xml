                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your kind post card of the 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04958_n1"/> inst. and papers just to
                hand. My cordial thanks to you.&#8212;</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> has already told you of
                the open air meeting held by our friends last Saturday&#8211;afternoon&#8212;the 13<hi
                    rend="underline">th</hi> inst&#8212;4 miles from Bolton<ptr target="loc.04957_n3"/>&#8212;<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02179.jpg" type="verso"/> to hear his account of
                his visit to you and to West Hills.<ptr target="loc.04957_n5"/>&#8212;It was a perfect September
                day,&#8212;warm, calm and bright, with a slight, pensive autumnal haze veiling the
                distance. We gathered together under the shade of a tree in the fields and listened
                for over an hour and a half to the D<hi rend="underline">r's</hi> story and examined
                the photos he handed round as he proceeded.<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.02180.jpg" type="recto"/> It brought you very near to us all and
                every heart was stirred as the D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> told us of your great
                kindness to him, and of your kind messages to us all&#8212;since repeated, again &#38;
                again, in your post cards to me. In the talk which followed a general feeling was
                expressed that our united gratitude, thanks &#38; affection should be conveyed to you,
                and I was commissioned to write to you.&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.02181.jpg" type="verso"/> It gives me great pleasure to do so for
                our little society owes its very existence, indirectly, to you, and we are all, in
                greater or less degree, your admirers &#38; lovers.</p>
            <p>One of the friends (Thomas Shonock)<ptr target="n5001"/> has since asked me to procure a copy of the
                pocket&#8211;book edition of L. of G.<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> for him.<ptr target="loc.04958_n2"/> So I will enclose a money order for
                22s/&#8212;, I shall be glad if you will send one at your convenience.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02182.jpg" type="recto"/> I am just beginning my
                holidays (long needed) &#38; your book accompanies me in all my rambles. I am spending
                the first few days at home and taking solitary walks in the lonely country lanes and
                on the moors near here. With you for company I have all I wish and spend blessed
                hours of sacred, vital communion with the wordless divine Spirit that informs all
                    things<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02183.jpg" type="verso"/> and with my
                own soul. How near and dear <hi rend="underline">you</hi> are to me I cannot tell
                you. But I am sure that no author before ever appealed to such depths of a man's
                nature, or aroused such tender, personal love. Very sure am I that your now despised
                poems will yet rank with the Hebrew Scriptures (to which alone I can compare them)
                as sacred and priceless&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.02184.jpg"
                    type="recto"/>springing from divine depths&#8212;the latest modern revelation of
                the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>I will enclose a cutting from last weeks paper giving another instance (at a place a
                few miles from here) of the latent heroism of the roughest classes.</p>
