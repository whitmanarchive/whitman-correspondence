            </opener>
            <p>At last I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="medium">match</unclear> half
                an hour from the everlasting sound of <choice>

                    <reg>so-called</reg>
                </choice> business for something real something pleasant. </p>
            <p>The sight even of your name above bring a healthy puff of honest air into my stuffy
                little cabin. </p>
            <p>Here saw at the other end of grand old Pennsylvania in a dusky town of iron &#38;
                smoke. Rude nature seems to have <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#if">born</unclear> a rude race of sons and given them a share of
                her <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03269.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> unconscious
                honesty &#38; self <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="high"
                    >forgetful</unclear> beauty. Here I am sure enough but my thoughts &#38; what I
                fancy the best part of my self are with you in your cozy study at Camden. </p>
            <p>My first thought is, how are you in body and nerves? Well? I hope, at the very least
                better! I'll answer for it you are well enough in mind. The mere sight of your
                cheery card humour and the mind contuse with your grand philosophy of good will
                bring peace and hope. </p>
            <p>They brought them to a very tough youngster whose worth is horribly twisted by the
                bitter herb of <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#if">Sardinia</unclear>: that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#if">galling</unclear>
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#if">flavor</unclear> of time &#38; talents wasted that is in my every waking sleeping
                thought. </p>

            <p>Bah! you will say what is the matter with the boy that he should write me all this
                    <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="low">taffy</unclear>. Quite true!
                for if I were to spoil <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="low"
                    >means</unclear> I could only say again and ever again, "I have seen "Walt Whitman" &#38;
                I know what "comradeship" is!" At this Xmas season it is <unclear reason="illegible"
                    resp="#ss" cert="low">our custom</unclear> to send greeting. At all time my fond
                wishes are for your health &#38; happiness &#38; for that other never to be named
                Nirvana you giant seers strive after. </p>
            <p>Heartiest greeting for Xmas &#38; many many happy New Years to all your home circle,
