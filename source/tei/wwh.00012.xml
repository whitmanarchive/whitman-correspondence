            <p>I will just write you a line to let you know I am all right—I sent you a <choice><abbr>N Y</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice> paper the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> of to-day with an <choice><abbr>acc't</abbr><expan>account</expan></choice> of the funeral<ptr target="wwh.00012_n3"/>—</p>
            
            <p>I am feeling pretty well for me—am stopping with Mr Johnston and his wife &amp; family—there is a big family &amp; they have moved up here in 5th Avenue—very grand—a big four or five story house, near 86th St overlooking the Park, cool &amp; fresh as can be—all are very kind, especially Mrs J. (the new one)—the children all call me Uncle Walt—the baby is bright &amp; interesting, but not rugged—(I hardly think its tenure of life secure)<ptr target="wwh.00012_n4"/>—I have many invitations, but don't accept them—</p>
            
            <p>I have seen John Burroughs &amp; he wants me to go up there to Esopus, but I don't think I shall go<ptr target="wwh.00012_n5"/>—I find my gray clothes very seasonable here, as it is cool enough all the time except at mid-day—</p>
