                fearful&#8212;Hope you &#38; George and Ed &#38; Deb &#38; Jo &#38; the young one are jolly &#38; sitting

                <p>I have followed your illness with breathless concern&#8212;that is, what I could
                    learn of it from the short and alarming dispatches in the "Daily News." I was so
                    rejoiced to see substantive proof of your part recovery in the firmly written post
                    cards to Mrs. Costelloe.<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/></p>
                <p>We both wanted to telegraph when you were so ill only we didn't know who to telegraph
                    to, as Mr. Smith<ptr target="n4979"/> was just leaving Phila.</p>
                <p>I have just received a letter from Ernest Rhys<ptr target="loc.03310_n1"/> who speaks
                    of having been back to England 2 weeks. 
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00023_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00022_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Mrs. Costelloe told me that he told
                    Count Stenbock<ptr target="n4328"/> that he (Ernest R) had made &#38; lost a fortune in the States.</p>
                <p>It is a cold rainy summer with us&#8212;so cold that we feel to want a fire.</p>
                <p>Mrs. William Rossetti<ptr target="n6123"/> is far from well &#38; is away at Ventnor
                    recruiting.</p> 
                <p>Saturday Grace<ptr target="n0890"/> &#38; I gave quite a large
                    party&#8212;58 guests&#8212;from 8.30 to 12 o.c. in the evening. Everyone seemed to
                    enjoy it &#38; the evening passed off quite brilliantly.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Costelloe is sitting 3 days a week to me &#8212;how affectionately and nicely
                    she talks of you.</p>
                <p>I think that I shall paint a pretty picture from her.</p>
                <p>You forwarded a long &#38; interesting letter from S. Morse<ptr target="n0862"/>
                    which I have duly answered: he wrote in excellent spirit&#8212;affairs seem to be
                    going well with him.</p>
