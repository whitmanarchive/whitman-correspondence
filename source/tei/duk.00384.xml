               <salute>Dear Walt.</salute> 
            </opener>
         <p>Received your book, also a letter for Han.&#8212;Feel proud myself&#8212;the copy I<ptr target="duk.00384_n100"/> now have is just the thing to handle frequently&#8212;I like the portrait, it looks very much as you do at the present time. It has a little air of a foreign savan&#8212;however&#8212;but it is a good likeness.</p>  
            <p>I think that some of the poems open splendid&#8212;grandly&#8212;there is a fault or eccentricity however, in some, that is, they diverge too abruptly from a lofty theme or elevating imagery into common place&#8212;ordinary&#8212;and repulsive object, or subject matter&#8212;But they are poems of the thoroughfare of life passions and emotions of the universe and humanity&#8212;on all sides taken&#8212;as they approach and appear without selection&#8212;sympathies utterd and communion held with all in turn and none rejected&#8212;Poems of glorious, liberal, soul filld emotion. They will be read&#8212;they must have a place&#8212;But you'l write a perfect poem one of these days, filld with nature sublime&#8212;Your thoughts are true thoughts&#8212;Common sense is the best philosophy&#8212;Cant has too long ruled the world and judged the case of erring humanity&#8212;Your poems are sustaining&#8212;I hope that there will be a jolly good fight over them&#8212;The public are lazy&#8212;and need some disturbance to arouse them&#8212;</p>
            <p>Many thanks to you&#8212;We expected to have seen you here&#8212;Han is disappointed, but you have been detaind in Boston a long time&#8212;Our scenery here has conceald all its lofty and varied beauty and sublimity&#8212;No rain has fal'n for two months&#8212;The sun rises and sets as if it threatend to pierce the earth with its ball of fire&#8212;The atmesphere is dense and impenetrable&#8212;the mountains totaly obscured. We shall see you some time&#8212;I want Han to see her Mother&#8212;for a change. I shall come to New York for her myself&#8212;I want to visit it&#8212;I think that I shall have to return to that place or Boston or get nearer some city&#8212;Give us more poems Walt&#8212;I hope there'l be a genearl big row&#8212;in the papers&#8212;Stir em up well&#8212;I look for it.</p>
