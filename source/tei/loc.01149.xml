                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> That piece of writing of yours in the last "Critic" is to me very impressive.<ptr
                    target="loc.01149_n1"/> It is seldom you have fallen into such a noble &amp; lofty
                strain. As I am myself trying to write a little these days, it makes me sad. It is
                like a great ship that comes to windward of me &amp; takes the breeze out of the sail
                of my little shallop. I shall have to lay by today &amp; let the impression wear <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01149.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> off. I think you
                have hit it exactly with that word physiological. It lets in a flood of light. The
                whole essay is one to be long conned over.</p>  
            <p> I went down to N.Y. to hear Arnold<ptr target="loc.05536_n4"/> on Emerson<ptr
                    target="loc.01149_n3"/> Friday night. Curtis<ptr target="loc.01149_n2"/>&#8212;the
                pensive Curtis introduced the lecturer. I wonder if you have heard Curtis
                speak? Tis a pity he is not a little more robust &amp; manly. He fairly leans &amp;
                languishes on the bosom of the Graces, one after another. Arnold looked hearty &amp;
                strong &amp; spoke in a foggy, misty English voice, that left the outlining of his
                sentences pretty <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01149.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                obscure, but which had a certain charm after all. The lecture contained nothing new.
                The <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> report you sent me, is an admirable
                summary&#8212;the pith of the whole lecture. He does not do full justice to Emerson
                as I hope to show in my essay. At least Emerson can be shorn of these things &amp;
                left a more impressive figure than Arnold leaves him. He had much to say about
                    Carlyle<ptr target="n0139"/> too, but would not place him with the great
                writers! Because he was more than a great literary man he denied him literary
                honors. Drop me a line when you feel like it. Winter <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01149.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> is in full blush up here &amp; the
                river snores &amp; groans like an uneasy sleeper. </p>
