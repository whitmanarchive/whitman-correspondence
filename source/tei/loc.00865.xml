         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00865_n100"/> went to the hospital in Pemberton Square yesterday and saw your friend Babbitt.<ptr target="loc.00865_n2"/>  I found him in a bad way.  For two months, he tells me, he has been unable to do any thing for himself on account of giddiness if he attempts to rise.  He therefor is confined to one position&#8212;poor fellow!&#8212;flat on his back, but is cheerful nevertheless, and on hearing your name he brightened up and gave me a warm welcome.  He was in Barre some time after his return from under your care, and among his friends he grew better&#8212;was able to go about; but the ride&#8212;some sixty miles, I think&#8212;so unsettled his nervous organization that for three weeks it seemed to him that he was still on the cars.  He has not sat up since.  He was very grateful for your interest, and his last words to me were&#8212;"tell him to write to me."  He cannot speak a loud word owing to his diseased throat.  He looks pretty well, however, and his hand was strong and honest when I shook it at parting.  His case I think a very painful one&#8212;how much harder than though he had gone into the battle and lost his life or a limb!  There seems a sort of hopelessness about this, and being unused to hospitals my feelings were far from cheerful, though I tried to say brave and encouraging things to him and uttered the customary platitudes&#8212;the "Be thou clothed" and "Be thou fed" formulas,&#8212;without giving a rag or a crumb else.  I asked if I could do anything for him.  He told me no, thanking me.  His thought seemed most on getting a letter from you.</p>
            <p>If you are in the Armory Hospital and inquire for Frank McDonald, Ward E., I believe you may say a kind word to a friend of mine.</p>
            <p>Hoping what I have written may interest you, I remain with much regard</p>
