            <p>Sunday (day before yesterday) I went with Mrs Costelloe<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> from London to 
                Hazelmere. I am confident they had not intended
                asking me but for some reason they did. Mrs C. was very nice indeed and I like her 
                as much as ever, neither do I believe
                that she has altered towards<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_zs.00448.jpg" type="verso"/>
                you <hi rend="underline">really</hi>, but for some reason
                she is silent on the subject&#8212;she did not speak of you 
                at all though we were much together
                and share of every thing else&#8212;I avoided the subject waiting to see if 
                she would begin upon it. Once she asked me what
                I was doing in the British Museum&#8212;I said "Working at some 
                translation" She wanted to know what
                translation. I told her something from the Danish<ptr target="loc.08164_n4"/> for a book some of<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_zs.00449.jpg" type="recto"/> us 
                were about to bring out.
                "Well what was the book about?" I said "about Walt Whitman" She said "oh" and did not pursue the subject. 
                I spent yesterday morning
                with Mr Smith<ptr target="loc.08165_n3"/>&#8212;he did not speak of you except a very few words. I gave him your 
                message&#8212;he scarcely seemed to hear it.
                Still I believe he is friendly to you in his heart. Mrs S. is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> friendly she is the only one who said
                anything actually unfriendly&#8212;she did not say <hi rend="underline">much</hi> but it was significant. I did not call on Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/>
                as it was too late when I got to Hazelmere &#38; too early when I left the next day but I am to spend Saturday after noon and Sunday
                there and Mr Smith will take me to Tennyson's. I do not however expect to <hi rend="underline">see</hi> T.<ptr target="loc.08165_n2"/></p>
            <p>All goes well, I am hearty and having a good time but shall be glad to get back and see my American &#38; Canadian friends again</p>
