                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman—</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>
                I am afraid it has been a long time since I sent thee a letter, although I have
                <hi rend="underline">wanted</hi> to write every day.</p>
            <p>
                We have been, since the New Year, in the midst of the most interesting of all our political
                fights, which is the more interesting from the fact that it was successful. The London
                Council, of which Frank<ptr target="n6114"/>  is a member, is practically a<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01381.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Parliament for the most important city in the world. London has never had municipal government,
                though with its 5,000,000 people it is almost a State in itself—but now the new County Councils Act
                has given the popularly elected body almost unlimited power. They can do practically what they choose—&amp;
                it is here that the various forms of Socialism will be practically thrashed out—for the world to see.
                The men who are elected are in a great majority strong reformers &amp;<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01381.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                Liberal—"progressists" is the new word for them—&amp; we all expect the tendency of their policy
                to be distinctly Socialistic. There is one noted socialist, John Burns,<ptr target="loc.01381_n2"/> among them, but next to him I suppose
                Frank is the most "advanced"—Last night the chief of the "Fabians"<ptr target="loc.07545_n4"/>—the most important Socialistic body—descended
                upon us to induce Frank to become the spokesman of their party, &amp; it is quite likely that he may ultimately
                find himself in that position—though he<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01381.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                does not actually call himself Socialist.</p> 
            <p>We are greatly delighted over his return, for it seems, for the moment, an opportunity for even greater immediate
                usefulness than a seat in Parliament under a Tory Government would be. But then Frank is an incurable Optimist
                &amp; <hi rend="underline">always</hi> sees that things are "for the best."</p>
            <p>The work that this involves is of course immense, &amp; I hardly see how he can manage it along with <choice><sic>is</sic><corr>his</corr></choice> legal work,
                but I suppose it will be fitted in somehow. I<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01381.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                am going into it heart &amp; soul with him, for I think it is really important &amp; worth devoting one's self to.</p>
            <p>Two women have been elected—but by a curious &amp; very English-y mandate, it is quite uncertain whether they are really qualified to serve or not.
                A petition has been filed against Lady Sandhurst<ptr target="loc.01381_n1"/> —one of the women—which will decide the matter before
                the Queen's Bench. Frank hopes to expend some of his<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01381.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                legal knowledge on the case—of course in <hi rend="underline">favour</hi> of the women!</p>
            <p>Mother,<ptr target="n7510"/> Father<ptr target="n4979"/> &amp; Alys<ptr target="n7014"/> have been away from all this turmoil. We all spent our Christmas holiday in Normandy together, &amp;
                when we came home they went to Paris &amp; then on down to the Riviera, &amp; are now in Mentone enjoying the blue sky
                &amp; warm air &amp; the lovely, lovely scenery. Their pleasure is heightened by the reflection that the fog in London
                has been almost<pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01381.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                continuous since Christmas.</p>
            <p>I wish I could bring little Ray<ptr target="n3137"/> for them to see. She is grown a big girl now, &amp; can actually say four or five
                consecutive words, &amp; remember as far back as three days! She tells me at night everything anyone has done to her
                in the day—When I ask her "What did papa do?", she invariably answers "Papa bizz" (busy)—And it is not far from the truth—This
                election contest has <hi rend="underline">overwhelmed</hi> him with work.</p><pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01381.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I see from the American papers that you are having a mild winter. I hope thee has been able to go out a good deal.
                The regret that I cannot live near thee grows greater instead of less every year. It is dreadful to know so little 
                of what thee is really doing.</p>
            <p>Now that the press is over, I hope to be able to write soon again.

                <p>I have just been cheered by the sight of thy handwriting. Many thanks for the "Boston Transcript"—I enjoyed Mr. Rhys'<ptr target="n4152"/> London letter much.
                It is a beautiful Spring-like day today. I am going to take little Ray to the "Zoo" for the irst time.</p>
