                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I send you by this mail the "Dark Blue"<!-- <ptr target="n0181"/> --> containing the second
                part of Noel's article.<!--annotation--> I think the illustration horrid. It makes
                you look like a sick monkey. I wonder Hennessy<!--the illustrator--> could draw such
                a <choice>

                    <corr>caricature</corr>
                </choice>. From what Conway<!-- <ptr target="n0170"/> --> said I inferred he had seen it and
                approved of it. I shall tell him what I think about it. I do not think the article
                amounts to <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kk">shucks</unclear>
                either. Rossetti<!-- <ptr target="n0522"/> --> said Noel was very much engrossed with
                politics, and it is evident he is engrossed with something else than poetry to write
                such a <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kk">mess!</unclear>

                </choice><!--editorial note--> noble paper it seems ineffectual enough, though
                Conway seemed to think it the more feeling of the two.&#8212;I have not seen Conway
                or Rossetti since I came back from Paris. I shall see Rossetti again but I do not
                seem to care much about Conway. I doubt if I could ever fraternize with him. He does
                not impress me as an eminently sincere and loveable person. It may be very cruel for
                me to say so, but he seems to me like a kind of literary broker, ever on his make,
                though I have no complaints to make of his treatment of me &amp; it may be if I knew
                him better I should like <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr.00006.003.jpg" type="recto"/><!--numeral "3" center margin; WW's hand? archivist's hand?-->him more. Rossetti I
                am drawn toward, and though my first impression of him was that he was a high flown
                literary cockney, yet I soon saw that it was of no <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">merit</unclear> and that he was a genuine good fellow.
                He praises Prof. Dowden whom he has met and says I will like him. I intend to go to
                Ireland if possible, though it looks doubtful &amp; now as Assistant Secretary
                Richardson<!--annotation--> has impressed me into his service here &amp; proposes to
                retain me &amp; my party a week or two later that we had contemplated staying. I am
                at work in the office or Branch of the Treasury Dept here with 4 or 5 other
                clerks<!-- editorial note on Whitman's scribal work? --> and the beautiful October
                days are slipping by and I am not tramping about Stratford or up the mountains of
                Wales or into Ireland <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr.00006.004.jpg" type="verso"/><!--numeral "4", center margin; WW's hand? archivist's hand?-->as I had promised
                myself I should be. I have seen enough of cities &amp; streets &amp; art and
                pictures &amp; museums to stand me all the rest of my days, and am in a hurry to set
                my face westward. I spent about a week in Paris &amp; got enough of it. I presume I
                was a little surprised when I went from here, so that I did not relish Paris as I
                should have done had I came to it fresh. It is certainly a very beautiful city and
                very clean &amp; tasteful. The ruins are in excellent taste &amp; are the best
                behaved ruins I ever saw, and the Parisians are the best measured people I ever saw.
                I think the waiters in the Hotels could give lessons to princes. They bring you
                fried eggs on a perfumed napkin, and the napkin on beautiful tissue paper &amp; the
                whole on a china plate (my paper has got mixed up) <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="syr.00006.005.jpg" type="recto"/><!--numeral "5" center margin; WW's hand? archivist's hand?-->and one hardly knows
                whether to face to &amp; eat or to lift up his hands in admiration. Yet from all
                that I was not deeply impressed with Paris. The aspect of the streets is very <choice>
                    <sic>monotenous</sic>
                    <corr>monotonous</corr>
                </choice>. See one block &amp; you have seen it all. It all seems to have been built
                the same day &amp; planned by the same architect &amp; the stone were unmistakably
                all dug from the same quarry. Hence it is not picturesque or quaint or homely like
                London or grand either: it is brilliant &amp; correct. I was much disappointed in
                the French soldiers; they are certainly a very inferior looking lot of men; small
                &amp; dirty &amp; indifferent. I find this is the impression of all Americans I have
                talked with who have seen them. <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="syr.00006.006.jpg" type="verso"/><!--numeral "6", center margin; WW's hand? archivist's hand?-->I
                believe there are but two more parties coming over with bonds. I hope you &amp;
                William<!--William Michael Rossetti, most likely; editorial note--> will be among
                them. I wrote quite a long letter to William which I hope he received. I have seen
                Carlyle<!--Thomas Carlyle annotation--> as I told him and liked him very much. I am
                sure you would like him &amp; that he would like you. But I must close, dear Walt,
