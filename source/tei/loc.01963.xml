                <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was very much delighted some weeks ago to receive a copy of the New Republic with a
                little memorandum in your handwriting. Time does not diminish my reverential
                admiration for your work, nor do the unintelligent remarks of the English press
                deter me from giving expression to the same in print. I hope soon to have an
                opportunity of explaining at large, in a new series of critical studies of the Greek
                Poets, what I meant in the little note alluded to by the reviewer of the Quarterly,
                &amp; to show how it is only by adopting an attitude of mind similar to yours that
                we can in this age be in true unity with whatever great &amp; natural &amp; human
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01963.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> has been
                handed to us from the past.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I was the more pleased to have this communication from you, because I feared that the
                last time I wrote to you I might perhaps have spoken something amiss. I
                then&#8212;it was about three years ago, I think,&#8212;sent you a poem called
                "Callicrates" &amp; asked you questions about "Calamus." Pray believe me that I only
                refer to this circumstance now in order to explain the reason why since that time I
                have kept silence from a fear I might have been importunate or ill-advised in what I
                wrote. There was really no reason why you should have noticed that communication;
                &amp; it gives me great <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01963.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/> satisfaction to feel that your friendly remembrance of me is not
                diminished.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Now, though late, I may express the deep sorrow with which I heard of your illness.
                How Whitman must have borne such a trial, no one knows better than one who like
                myself has learned to have absolute faith in his manliness and vigour of Soul. Yet
                it is not the less sad to think that he who could enjoy life so fully, has met with
                this impediment.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I look forward with a keen foretaste of delight to your new volume announced.</p>
