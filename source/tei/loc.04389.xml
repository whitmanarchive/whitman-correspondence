                Another perfect day. I write this in Dr's<ptr target="n0119"/> office @ 4.30pm.&#8212;The windows&#8212;wide open&#8212;admit 
                a gentle pleasant breeze. Outside, the sky perfectly clear &#38; cloudless, the fountain playing, 
                the trees across the open space, along the avenue &#38; in the distance with shades &#38; various colours&#38;very 
                beautiful in the sunshine. Dr Beemer just entering his buggy as I write, &#38; driving off.

                It seems to me as though I had entered an "Earthly Paradise."&#8212;Day after day of unsurpassed beauty&#8212;nights 
                of wonderful moonlight radiance, doubly beautiful amid the trees &#38; on the lawns &#38; flowers of this beautiful 
                place&#8212;the soothing rest &#38; peace &#38; the hospitable kindness of all the people here&#8212;all combine to 
                make it very sweet &#38; pleasant to me. Indeed, I tell the Dr. that unless I leave soon I shall find it difficult 
                to tear myself away! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have no special news since my last letter. We drove
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00937_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                into town yesterday afternoon&#8212;everything of interest to me, the shops, the vehicles, the people, the streets, buildings 
                pavements, fields, <hi rend="underline">everything</hi>&#8212;and everything looking its best in the glorious 
                sunshine.&#8212;Evening spent in the house&#8212;chiefly in learning &#38; playing "Pedro" with Willie &#38; his friends.

                To chapel this morning, &#38; afterwards to church! (Rev'd Mr Richardson's.) Thoughts &#38; feelings 
                of a very mixed character! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. writing letters &#38;c. He seems to me to look a good

                deal better since he came home,&#8212;has a better colour &#38; looks fresher.

                A long pause here&#8212;discussing future arrangements as to my trip with Dr. Decided nothing, however, for the present.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope that we shall hear that you have been able to take a drive again this lovely weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. says he is "going to quit whether school keeps or not." So <hi rend="underline">I</hi> will quit too. With love to you
