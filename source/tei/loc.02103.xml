            <p>That birthday bit in Lippincott<ptr target="loc.07874_n5"/> is a capital thing, and most 
                satisfactory for friends over sea who wanted
               some direct words, &amp; evidence as to health &amp;c. Friend Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> has done his
                photographing well and deserves our thanks.<ptr target="loc.02103_n5"/> Conway's<ptr target="n0170"/> is the only bit that reads just
                a little stilted &amp; as if written with one eye turned inwards &amp; the other one half on you &amp;
                half on the public. Well, well! Now this is not very charitable, and after all it's a jolly, hearty, 
                manly crowd that we see through Traubel's pages, gathering round your revered form, dear Walt Whitman.
                Last time I wrote I was going to the Vienna Postal Congress. Since
               I came back I have
               <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02103.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                had Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> staying with me &amp; giving me all the last
                news of you &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#adk" cert="medium">renewing</unclear>
               old memories (grand times!); &amp; while I was there at Vienna I met "an Americano [not] one of
               the roughs,"<ptr target="loc.02103_n6"/> but one who knows you. This was William Potter<ptr target="loc.02103_n9"/> 
                of Philadelphia, who was one of Wanamaker's<ptr target="loc.02103_n10"/> Delegate's to the Congress—one 
                of the United States' Delegates, to speak strictly.
               He is a real good fellow: he was the best friend made at the Congress this time.</p>
            <p>The money I'm sending in this letter (about 15 dollars) is chiefly for "Good bye, my Fancy!"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> which
               I am without, though I have seen Bucke's copy. I want a copy in cloth as issued, with your name
               &amp; mine written in it if the old indulgent mood holds, and two copies of the untrimmed sheets 
               not bound. Then I want, if it is
               <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02103.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
               to be had, six copies of "A Backward Glance"<ptr target="loc.02103_n2"/> as printed on thin paper to be 
                annexed to L. of G. (pocket book edition<ptr target="loc.02527_n6"/>)—they need not be stitched or done up any way, but on one 
                I should like your name &amp; mine on the title-leaf. There are several minor works, or rather separate
                works, which I fancy you still have, &amp; of which one copy each similarly inscribed would be very welcome:
                These are "Passage to India,"<ptr target="n0465b"/> "Democratic Vistas,"<ptr target="n4122"/> 
                "After All &amp;c.,"<ptr target="loc.02103_n7"/> &amp; "As a Strong Bird."<ptr target="n0746b"/></p>
            <p>Lastly, my youngest son, Maurice Buxton Forman,<ptr target="loc.02107_n4"/> is likely to go out into this 
                world soon—most probably to Egypt: he is now nearly 20. When he goes I want him to have the big 
                book—Complete Poems and Prose;<ptr target="n4132"/> and if it were attached to him by your own hand in the same way the 
                effect on his mind would be good.

               He is studiously disposed, and it is about time he began on the Leaves; indeed he <hi rend="underline">has</hi>
               begun. So I want to buy him his copy, for a part of his essential outfit, whether you write on it or not. 
               Now if it chances that you do <hi rend="underline">all</hi> I am asking, and the money does not run to it, 
                as well might be, the mention of the figure minus will bring the rest by
               first-post.
