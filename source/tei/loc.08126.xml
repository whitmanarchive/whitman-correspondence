            <p>It is five days since the election but the excitement has not yet subsided.<ptr target="loc.08114_n3"/> The government will have a majority of about 30 but made up entirely
                from the outlying provinces&#8212;extreme east and extreme west Ontario gives them little or no majority and Quebec has gone badly against them.
                If old John A. (the Premier)<ptr target="loc.08126_n3"/> was 20 years younger he might pull his party together and tide it over&#8212;but as it is I do not believe that he
                with his 76 years can pull through. He will keep things going for a while, of course, but when he strikes a rapid, and there are several bad ones
                just a little downstream of him, his boat is apt to go to pieces.</p>
            <p>Did I mention having received and read the "National Literature" piece?<ptr target="loc.04786_n2"/> It is good, first rate in fact&#8212;the language a little

                cranky and queer in places but the thought fresh and vigorous and true. I like it well.</p>

            <p>Your condition still seems wretched&#8212;you do not seem to rally&#8212;that is bad&#8212;why do you not send for a good doctor? Surely something
                could be done to give you relief.</p>
            <p>Thanks for the "Critic"&#8212;I have glanced through it and shall read it later.</p>
            <p>All quiet with the meter,<ptr target="loc.07230_n2"/> we have not got into the swing of manufacturing it yet but are on the way and will get there all right&#8212;I am at present
                at work organizing a staff to manufacture.</p>
            <p>We have had dark, damp, raw, very unpleasant weather here for some weeks. Today bright and pleasant&#8212;spring will soon be with us again&#8212;with you
