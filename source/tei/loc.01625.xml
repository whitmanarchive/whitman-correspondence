            <p>I am still holding on about the same&#8212;it is pretty certain I don't get behindhand, 
                &amp; that's about the best I can say&#8212;continue to get out a little every day 
                when the weather will permit&#8212;but my walking power is still very bad indeed&#8212;Pete I sent the shirts<ptr target="loc.01625_n1"/> this morning by Adams express&#8212;they are enveloped 
                in a flat paper box about 2 feet long by 1 wide&#8212;I hope they will get there Saturday&#8212;(but possibly may not reach you till Monday)&#8212;(You must pay the freight there)&#8212;I hope they will fit&#8212;the blue one (it wasn't done till last night) is to wear over&#8212;I got the stuff, it is first rate Middlesex flannel, cost $5, (same as my summer 
                suits are made of,)&#8212;is not intended to be washed often&#8212;but can be when necessary&#8212;must then be washed by some one experienced in washing nice flannels&#8212;I sent Graphic with my portrait<ptr target="loc.01625_n2"/>&#8212;(as they sent me some)&#8212;also my Capitol letter<ptr target="loc.01625_n3"/>&#8212;I rec'd your good letter last Tuesday</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01625.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>Dear son, I send you $10 for your Christmas present&#8212;perhaps you will need a pair 
                of winter boots, (or some good cotton flannel for underclothes&#8212;or something)&#8212;I rec'd a good letter from Mr. Eldridge&#8212;Mrs. O'Connor was to come home last Tuesday&#8212;I sent a paper to Parker Milburn with my portrait&#8212;also to Charley Towner&#8212;I hope you carried yours up to Mr. Nash, as I know it would interest &amp; amuse him 
                &amp; Mrs. Nash&#8212;give them both my love&#8212;(I see just a line in the paper that Mr. Nash 
                had given some reminiscences at a meeting of the Oldest Inhabitants.)<ptr target="loc.01625_n4"/>&#8212;I see the B &amp; P. RR.<ptr target="loc.01625_n5"/> had a bad freight car accident last Wednesday night 
                at Patapsco, but no injury to human life or limb&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;I have not been quite so well in the head yesterday &amp; to-day&#8212;but am around as usual, 
                as it is nothing very heavy&#8212;We are having a mild spell here, this is the third day, 
                with partial rain &amp; fog&#8212;It is now just after 1&#8212;I am sitting here writing this in 
                the parlor by the heater&#8212;my dinner is about ready, &amp; I am going&#8212;Every thing is very complete 
                &amp; correct here&#8212;but O I need your dear loving face &amp; hand &amp; voice&#8212;</p>
