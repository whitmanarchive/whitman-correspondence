            <p>(<name>Meltonsville</name> is 10 miles North East of this village at the extreme southern point or great bend of the Tenneſsee river, and was never anything but a post office&#8212;Willwell Farm is 3 miles from that office&#8212;near the "lordly" and beautiful Tenneſsee, in a <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#js">populous</unclear> little valley. The home of the <hi rend="underline">rude</hi> "Philosopher" who out-natures nature. Latitude 34 1/2 precisely. This is a beautiful country, and the climate excellent.</p>
            
            <p>Lack of culture and the <hi rend="underline">love of the ideal</hi> in any sense other than the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> and <hi rend="underline">barbarous</hi> is the main defect. <hi rend="underline">Orthodoxy</hi> flourishes withe the usual <hi rend="underline">lack</hi> of <hi rend="underline">flowers</hi> or <hi rend="underline">fruit</hi>. This is the
            
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01840.002.jpg" type="verso"/>"Sunny South" indeed. Winter here is a holiday or treat. This county is composed of mountains and their table lands about 400 feet above the valleys, and valleys sometimes regularly oblong and sometimes crooked and branching. The Tenneſsee dips in like a crooked arm and scoops off the North. West <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">quarter</unclear> of the county as if it would <hi rend="underline">steal</hi> that fraction and some sister counties to give to the state of its own name.</p>
            
            <p>The white population predominates here enough to free us from the unpleasantness experienced in other parts of our state. Many candidates for offices here now. The "philosopher" too quiet and impartial to ever be a party man, thinks
            
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01840.003.jpg" type="recto"/>that in some of the cases A ought not to have the office&#8212;because B wants it, and B ought not to have it&#8212;because A wants it, and both ought not to have it&#8212;because neither is fit for it. This is a queer letter to come from a sober, studious thoughtful man&#8212;so careful in all business matters, but I have so written it, both for information and to <hi rend="underline">amuse</hi> my friend Mr. Whitman who has done me the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> <hi rend="underline">honor</hi> of my life.</p>
            
            <p>The book (of Burroughs') and the packet of letter, poem, and picture came, as the result of the only <hi rend="underline">approach</hi> I have ever made or expected to make to any noted man. I am delighted and grateful beyond the power of words of mine to express,
            
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01840.004.jpg" type="verso"/>I suspect the most notable point in Burroughs' book is page 42 middle and only <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">um</unclear> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#ej">late</unclear> paragraph&#8212;about criticism&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I write by night at a relatives house near <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word" unit="chars" quantity="4" resp="#ej"/> and think I must send a dollar to pay for the book, and <hi rend="underline">return those stamps</hi> 44 <choice><abbr>cts</abbr><expan>cents</expan></choice> (or value in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">scribing</unclear> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ej">unless;</unclear> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ej">manageable</unclear>)&#8212;it looks too much like you wanted to <hi rend="underline">square</hi> with me for that gold dollar, <hi rend="underline">which</hi> I want to <hi rend="underline">represent</hi> the <hi rend="underline">lifting of the veil between Two "natural" and warm hearts.</hi></p>
            
            <p>Let me take the <hi rend="underline">will</hi> for the <hi rend="underline">deed</hi>&#8212;as to the <hi rend="underline">book</hi>. Leaves of Grass ought to be worth $50 to as poor a man as I.</p>
            
            <p>Please send a card before <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">too</unclear> long&#8212;stating your health. I know the style of my letters is queer, but if you had thought them <hi rend="underline">absurd</hi> or <hi rend="underline">insincere</hi> you would not have answered.</p>
