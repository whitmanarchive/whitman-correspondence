                    <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>In New York on Thursday I saw Marvin and was glad to hear from you through him.&#8212;He said
                    you had not seen the Nation review of Dr <choice>
                        <orig>Buckes</orig>
                        <reg>Bucke's</reg>
                    </choice> book and had expressed a desire to do so. So having a copy I cut it out and
                    enclose it. You will see it makes some outrageously false statements about you
                    at which your friends were naturally indignant, but I am surprised that William
                    was green enough to suppose that he could get any reply printed in that organ of
                    the Philistines; and he probably made it so severe as to preclude its
                    publication <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal.00293.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    any way even supposing them to
                    have been suddenly smitten with a conscience. A very improbable
                    supposition.&#8212;</p>
                <p>You have heard that I have finally received the "grand bounce" from an ungrateful
                    government. The fact is I have been rather badly treated by an uncircumsized dog
                    from Kentucky, but such a thing was bound to happen sooner or later, and better
                    now than later.</p>
                <p>I am still in the prime of life, have health, some means and many friends, and if
                    under these circumstances I did not cheerfully accept the situation I should be
                    unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass, with its philosophy of hope and the
                    morning.&#8212;</p>
                <p>I enclose you my professional card. If
                    after a fair trial I do not succeed in earning a living <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                        facs="yal.00293.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> in this way I shall probably
                    drift back into my old trade of Publishing.</p>
                <p>I hope you are as comfortable as usual, and enjoying as much of life as you
                    describe in some of the later notes in Specimen Days.&#8212;</p>
                <p>I should be delighted to hear from you, and believe me ever</p>
