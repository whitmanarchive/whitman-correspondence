        <salute>Dear brother Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have just rec'd your letter, &amp; glad indeed to hear directly from you all. I hear
        through mother<ptr target="n0705"/>, but have been expecting a letter from Mat<ptr
          target="n0707"/> now for some time&#8212;Mother's letters are almost always mentioning
        Matty with love &amp; sympathy, &amp; fretting when she <choice>
          <orig>dont</orig>
          <reg>don't</reg>
        </choice> hear from her&#8212;Dear Mat, we all love her so much, &amp; think about her more
        than she knows&#8212;</p>

      <p>I am now working in another branch of the Department&#8212;have it easier&#8212;whenever
        you write direct to me&#8212;"<hi rend="italic">Solicitor's Office, Treasury</hi>"
        Washington, D. C.</p>

      <p>I have just written a letter to Han<ptr target="n0285"/>&#8212;I write quite often, &amp;
        send papers, &amp;c&#8212;I shall write to mother this morning&#8212;Mother is quite alone
        there in the house, as the people down stairs<ptr target="wwh.00009_n1"/> have moved
        out&#8212;(George turned 'em out for impudence to mother)&#8212;I write every other day,
        &amp; send papers &amp; stuff&#8212;My next piece is to appear in the "<hi rend="italic"
          >Kansas Magazine</hi>" for February<ptr target="wwh.00009_n2"/>&#8212;will be out very
        shortly&#8212;It is a new magazine, same style as the Atlantic&#8212;intended for <hi
          rend="italic">Western thought</hi> &amp; reminiscences &amp;c&#8212;</p>

      <p>Dear Brother, &amp; dear Sister Matty, I should like to come on, according to your
        invitation, &amp; pay you a good visit, but it is doubtful this time&#8212;My bringing out a
        new book is only bringing out a new edition, from the stereotype plates, the same as the
        last&#8212;only in one Vol&#8212;as the edition printed a year ago is all
        exhausted&#8212;(But I stereotyped it, &amp; have all the plates in New York.) But I should
        like to have a good long visit home, &amp; be with mother&#8212;my getting leave does not
        work yet as I hoped&#8212;but I expect to fix it somehow, &amp; go home before very
        long&#8212;I am very well this winter&#8212;My book is flourishing in foreign lands at a
        great rate&#8212;I get letters from all parts of Europe&#8212;I believe I told you Tennyson
        had written me twice and very hearty &amp; friendly letters, inviting me to come &amp; be
        his guest, &amp;c&#8212;Then the professors in the Universities, Dublin &amp; elsewhere in
        Great Britain deliver lectures on "Leaves of Grass"&#8212;&amp;c&#8212;But <hi rend="italic"
          >here</hi> the enemy have the ground mostly to themselves&#8212;</p>

      <p>I suppose you see we have a new Attorney General<ptr target="wwh.00009_n3"/>&#8212;It
        doesn't seem to make much difference to me so far&#8212;</p>

      <p>Jeff, did the photos I sent of mother &amp; me come to you, December?</p>

      <p>Dear sister Mat, &amp; Hatty &amp; California,<ptr target="wwh.00009_n4"/> love to you
        all&#8212;I am writing this at my desk, toward noon, very bright &amp; sunny, but cold
        enough&#8212;I often think of you all&#8212;Mat, when I go home I shall do my part at that
          <hi rend="italic">cake</hi> you speak of in letter to mother&#8212;Wm. O'Connor<ptr
          target="n0452"/> &amp; family have gone on a short trip to Cuba, to be back in three
        weeks&#8212;They are all well&#8212;</p>

      <p>Mother told me the barrel of flour came safe&#8212;but it was too bad Mat's Christmas
        letter got lost&#8212;</p>

      <closer>
        <salute>Good bye to you for this time, Brother Jeff &amp; Matty dear,</salute>
        <signed rend="right">Walt.</signed>
      </closer>

      <postscript>
        <p>Mat, you write to mother often as you can&#8212;</p>
