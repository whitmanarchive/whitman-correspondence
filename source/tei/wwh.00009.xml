        <salute>Dear brother Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have just rec'd your letter, &amp; glad indeed to hear directly from you all. I hear
        through mother<ptr target="n0705"/>, but have been expecting a letter from Mat<ptr target="n0707"/> now for some time—Mother's letters are almost always mentioning
        Matty with love &amp; sympathy, &amp; fretting when she <choice>
          <orig>dont</orig>
          <reg>don't</reg>
        </choice> hear from her—Dear Mat, we all love her so much, &amp; think about her more
        than she knows—</p>

      <p>I am now working in another branch of the Department—have it easier—whenever
        you write direct to me—"<hi rend="italic">Solicitor's Office, Treasury</hi>"
        Washington, D. C.</p>

      <p>I have just written a letter to Han<ptr target="n0285"/>—I write quite often, &amp;
        send papers, &amp;c—I shall write to mother this morning—Mother is quite alone
        there in the house, as the people down stairs<ptr target="wwh.00009_n1"/> have moved
        out—(George turned 'em out for impudence to mother)—I write every other day,
        &amp; send papers &amp; stuff—My next piece is to appear in the "<hi rend="italic">Kansas Magazine</hi>" for February<ptr target="wwh.00009_n2"/>—will be out very
        shortly—It is a new magazine, same style as the Atlantic—intended for <hi rend="italic">Western thought</hi> &amp; reminiscences &amp;c—</p>

      <p>Dear Brother, &amp; dear Sister Matty, I should like to come on, according to your
        invitation, &amp; pay you a good visit, but it is doubtful this time—My bringing out a
        new book is only bringing out a new edition, from the stereotype plates, the same as the
        last—only in one Vol—as the edition printed a year ago is all
        exhausted—(But I stereotyped it, &amp; have all the plates in New York.) But I should
        like to have a good long visit home, &amp; be with mother—my getting leave does not
        work yet as I hoped—but I expect to fix it somehow, &amp; go home before very
        long—I am very well this winter—My book is flourishing in foreign lands at a
        great rate—I get letters from all parts of Europe—I believe I told you Tennyson
        had written me twice and very hearty &amp; friendly letters, inviting me to come &amp; be
        his guest, &amp;c—Then the professors in the Universities, Dublin &amp; elsewhere in
        Great Britain deliver lectures on "Leaves of Grass"—&amp;c—But <hi rend="italic">here</hi> the enemy have the ground mostly to themselves—</p>

      <p>I suppose you see we have a new Attorney General<ptr target="wwh.00009_n3"/>—It
        doesn't seem to make much difference to me so far—</p>

      <p>Jeff, did the photos I sent of mother &amp; me come to you, December?</p>

      <p>Dear sister Mat, &amp; Hatty &amp; California,<ptr target="wwh.00009_n4"/> love to you
        all—I am writing this at my desk, toward noon, very bright &amp; sunny, but cold
        enough—I often think of you all—Mat, when I go home I shall do my part at that
          <hi rend="italic">cake</hi> you speak of in letter to mother—Wm. O'Connor<ptr target="n0452"/> &amp; family have gone on a short trip to Cuba, to be back in three
        weeks—They are all well—</p>

      <p>Mother told me the barrel of flour came safe—but it was too bad Mat's Christmas
        letter got lost—</p>

      <closer>
        <salute>Good bye to you for this time, Brother Jeff &amp; Matty dear,</salute>
        <signed rend="right">Walt.</signed>
      </closer>

      <postscript>
        <p>Mat, you write to mother often as you can—</p>
      </postscript>
