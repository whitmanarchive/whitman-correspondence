            <p>Four letters of the 18th and 19th<ptr target="loc.02105_n2"/> of October reached me
                together as you intended. You may be sure, dear Walt Whitman, that the moment I had
                them I wrote to Mr. Balestier<ptr target="loc.07893_n6"/> to make an appointment. He
                replied promptly that what he was really after was the American copyright—only
                in a minor<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02105.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> degree
                the Continental, and not the English at all, which in his opinion does not exist. He
                said he would appoint a meeting very shortly; &amp; I am daily expecting to hear
                again. My own impression is that if you revised your works finally in few or many
                details, and the revision was first published here, the new readings would have
                English copyright—which a publisher could defend, and so maintain the position
                of publishing the only<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02105.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> finally correct edition. Anything that I can do to forward your
                views will be a pleasure to me, be sure; but I expect to get no further with Mr.
                Balestier than to ascertain just what is the scope and end of his present approach
                to you. The moment I can see what he is driving at I will write to you again. About
                    <hi rend="underline">American</hi> copyright, of course, I have absolutely no
                instructions from you.</p>
            <p>The above I have written 24 hours after receipt of your letter<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02105.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of the 29th of October,<ptr target="loc.02105_n3"/> with the
                enclosure which is too precious to name. Could I have caught the Cunarder-mail
                of this morning from Queenstown, I should have written
                yesterday, if only to send my love and thanks for the delicate kindness you have
                done me. Your intuitive knowledge of men is wonderful: I do not know anything you
                could have sent that would have touched me as your latest gift has done. <hi rend="underline">But how did you know that, dear Walt Whitman</hi>?</p>
