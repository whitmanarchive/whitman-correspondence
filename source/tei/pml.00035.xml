                <p>Mother, I wrote yesterday in my letter that I had a bad cold—I felt quite disagreeable yesterday, but went 
                to bed early, &amp; had a good sleep—to-day, Tuesday, I have felt all right.</p>
            
            <p>It has been snowing some here to-day—I have been out walking though—it is not cold—As I write this, I am sitting 
                here in the office, (Treasury solicitor's) at 8 o'clock—have been reading &amp; writing all by myself—</p>
            
            <p>Mother, you get Mrs. Bruce to give you Gracie's address in Iowa—I have just got some nice copies of my Am. Institute piece from Boston, &amp; I will send her one—<ptr target="pml.00035_n1"/>let Mr. or Mrs. Bruce write the address on a slip of paper and you enclose it in your next—The last time I saw Arthur Price here<ptr target="pml.00035_n3"/> he invited me to come down to the Navy yard here to visit his vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Mahopac</hi>—so Saturday, after I left work, I went down—but found myself a day after the fair—the vessel had gone about an hour before I got there—I believe she has gone to <choice><orig>Norfold</orig><reg>Norfolk</reg></choice>.</p>
            
            <p>Mother, on those envelopes you have you just cross out, draw a line over this way,<ptr target="pml.00035_n5"/> when you send them, &amp; leave the rest, (like you did your last)—and they will come safe—I got your letter this morning—it is too bad the letter Mat sent Christmas was lost—that was a real nice present of a barrel of flour—Poor Mat,<ptr target="pml.00035_n6"/> I feel real blue to think of her condition—but perhaps she will come round yet—and may be live as long as any of us—</p>
            
                <p>Well, mama dear, I will close for to-night &amp; finish it to-morrow—</p>

            <p>Mother, I am feeling well to-day—I think my cold must have been a false alarm, or else I have got off very easy—The weather is bitter cold here to-day, but bright &amp; clear—</p>
            
            <p>What do you hear from George—I kind of hope he will not go to Milwaukee—should not wish to have him &amp; Lou live so far away, unless the inducement is very great—</p>
            
            <p>Nothing new in the office—I like this place just as well as the other—I have not a room to myself, it is true—We are pretty well crowded—they are mostly young men, &amp; a good deal of noise &amp; moving about—but I don't mind it, as it is only from 9 to 3—&amp; my work is much easier—Has Eddy got well of his cold?</p>
            
            <p>I shall probably be on hand to eat some of Mat's cake—Good bye for to-day, mother dear—</p>
