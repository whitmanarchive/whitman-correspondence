            <p>How do you feel now. I wrote to Grandma<!-- <ptr target="n0705"/> --> yesterday
                evening<space extent="3 letters"/>Mama's<!-- <ptr target="n0707"/> --> death was
                very unexpected here the day was so pleasant that she asked
                Papa<!-- <ptr target="n0710"/> --> to take her out riding and Papa said he would so
                he brought up the buggy and lifted Mama in he then went to take the reins and just
                then Mama said. Now wait till I get my dress fixed and Papa waited <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02865.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> and then she
                fell over &amp; never spoke another word when I came home<space extent="6 letters"/>from school I found that<space extent="6 letters"/>Dear Mama was dying. when<space extent="7 letters"/>I left for school in the morning Mama said she felt better
                that she had the best <choice>

                </choice> sleep in a long while it was such a shock to me I had run about two blocks
                to see her I saw the buggy outside of the door and I felt so glad that I could see
                her before she went out but when I came in I saw her pale face and I did not know
                what to do</p>
            <p>We had a very large funeral the office was closed so that all the commissioners came.
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02865.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Grandma must
                have felt very badly when she heard it Poor Dear Mama died 14 of 8 on Wednesday
                evening we had a large number of friends here but no one could do her any good I
                think it is better for Mama that she is dead she suffered <hi rend="underline">so</hi> much. Mr Lane<!-- <ptr target="n0354"/> --> came out he got here on saturday
                morning he would have been here on friday morning but he was left he just got to the

                pleasant for Papa Dear Papa feels so badly I do not know how we can <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02865.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> hardly live
                without Dear Mama. You do not know how hard it was to see her die but she knew me
                when I got home though she could not speak to me.</p>
