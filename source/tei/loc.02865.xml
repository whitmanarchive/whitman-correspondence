            <p>How do you feel now.<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/>
                I wrote to Grandma<ptr target="n0705"/> yesterday evening Mama's<ptr target="duk.00465_n9"/> death was very 
                unexpected here the day was so pleasant that she asked Papa<ptr target="n0710"/> to take her out 
                riding and Papa said he would so he brought up the buggy and lifted Mama in he then went to take the 
                reins and just then Mama said. Now wait till I get my dress fixed and Papa waited 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad.00242_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                and then she fell over &amp; never spoke another word when I came home<space extent="6 letters"/>from 
                school I found that<space extent="6 letters"/>Dear Mama was dying. when<space extent="7 letters"/>I 
                left for school in the morning Mama said she felt better that she had the best 
                <choice><sic>nights</sic><corr>night's</corr></choice> sleep in a long while it was 
                such a shock to me I had run about two blocks to see her I saw the buggy outside of the door and 
                I felt so glad that I could see her before she went out but when I came in I saw her pale face and I did not know what to do</p>
            <p>We had a very large funeral the office was closed so that all the commissioners came.

                Grandma must have felt very badly when she heard it Poor Dear Mama died &#188; of 8 on Wednesday 
                evening we had a large number of friends here but no one could do her any good I think it is better 
                for Mama that she is dead she suffered <hi rend="underline">so</hi> 
                much. Mr Lane<ptr target="n0354"/> came out he got here on <choice><sic>saturday</sic><corr>Saturday</corr></choice> 
                morning he would have been here on <choice><sic>friday</sic><corr>Friday</corr></choice> morning but he 
                was left he just got to the depot to see the cars start</p>
            <p><choice><sic>Every body</sic><corr>Everybody</corr></choice> is very kind out here but if one of you would
                only be here it would be so pleasant for Papa Dear Papa feels so badly I do not know how we can 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02865.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                hardly live without Dear Mama. You do not know how hard it was to see her die but she knew me when I got home though she could 
                not speak to me.</p>
            <p>It has been very cold here but it is <choice><sic>quiet</sic><corr>quite</corr></choice> pleasant today. 
                Jessie<ptr target="n0703"/> has gone to school so I am home all alone with the girls</p>
            <p>If I only could see Dear Grandma I think I would be happy but as I cannot I suppose I shall have to go
                without seeing her</p> 
            <p>I have just got home from market but it is not of hardly any use to try to get Papa any thing to eat 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_ad.00245_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                as he <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> eat anything</p>
            <p>Mama deceived me very much her face was so <choice><sic>swolen</sic><corr>swollen</corr></choice> 
                that she looked so well and she never gave up I <choice><sic>all ways</sic><corr>always</corr></choice> 
                thought that she would be in bed a few days 
                before she died but she was not. She was dressed so nicely and neatly that she beautiful after she died 
                but she did not look very natural the swelling went down and it altered her face very much indeed</p>
            <p>Mrs. Flad<ptr target="n0234"/> has just been 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_ad.00246_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                here. I am hardly ever alone now, we both sleep with Papa<space extent="5 letters"/>and that is so 
                nice.<space extent="4 letters"/>When Papa telegraphed<space extent="4 letters"/>we did not receive an 
                answer for about two days and a half so it kept us very 
                anxious some one has been here all night ever since Mama died Papa was holding 
                <choice><sic>Mamas</sic><corr>Mama's</corr></choice> 
                head and she would <choice><sic>breath</sic><corr>breathe</corr></choice> easy one

                <choice><sic>the breath</sic><corr>then breathe</corr></choice> hard she continued 
                this way for three hours and a half and then she drew her last <choice><sic>breadth</sic><corr>breath</corr></choice></p>
            <p>The time flies very quickly I have some little things to do every day so that I am kept

                it was such a nice letter that it was <choice><sic>to</sic><corr>too</corr></choice> bad that it did
                not come a day before</p>
            <p>Mama would have been so glad to have read it We got some of Mama's pictures yesterday. 
                Papa says he would send you one now but we have only two one large and one small so that he wants 
                to keep them till he can get the rest and then he will send you all some
