          <salute>Dear Wm. Stansberry,</salute><ptr target="duk.00669_n2"/>
      </opener>

      <p>I will just write you a few lines off-hand. Your letter of May 14<ptr target="duk.00669_n3"/> has come to hand to-day, reminding me of your being in Armory Square 
        Hospital &amp; of my visits there, &amp; meeting you, in '65. 
        Your writing, or something it has started, strangely, deeply touches me. It takes me back 
        to the scenes of ten years ago, in the war, the hospitals of Washington, the many wounded 
        <choice><orig status="unremarkable">bro't</orig><reg>brought</reg></choice> up after the battles, and the never-to-be told sights of suffering &amp; death. To think 
        that the little gift &amp; word of kindness, should be remembered by you so long&#8212;&amp; that the kiss 
        I gave you amid those scenes, should be treasured up, &amp; as it were sent back to me after many years! 
        Dear Comrade&#8212;you do me good,<ptr target="duk.00669_n4"/> by your loving wishes &amp; feelings to me in your letters.
      </p>
      
      <p>I send you my love, &amp; to your dear children &amp; wife the same. As I write, you seem very dear to me too, 
        like some young brother, who has been lost, but now found. Whether we shall ever meet each other 
        is doubtful&#8212;probably we never will&#8212;but I feel that we should both be happy, if we could be together&#8212;(I find there are some that it is just comfort enough to be together, almost without any thing else)&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I remain about the same in my sickness. I sleep &amp; eat pretty well&#8212;go about same, look stout &amp; red, 
        (though looking now <hi rend="italic">very</hi> old &amp; gray, but that is nothing new)&#8212;weigh 185 now&#8212;am badly lamed 
        in my left leg, &amp; have bad spells, occasionally days, of feebleness, distress in head, &amp;c. 
        I think I shall get well yet, but may not. Have been laid up here a year doing nothing, 
        except a little writing. As far as room, food, care, &amp;c. are concerned, I am well situated here&#8212;but <hi rend="italic">very lonesome</hi>&#8212;have no near friends, (in the deepest sense) here at hand&#8212;my mother died 
        here a year ago&#8212;a sorrow from which I have never entirely recovered, &amp; likely never shall&#8212;she was an unusually noble, cheerful woman&#8212;very proud-spirited &amp; generous&#8212;am poor, 
        (yet with a little income, &amp; means, just enough to pay my way, with strict economy, 
        to be independent of want)&#8212;</p>
