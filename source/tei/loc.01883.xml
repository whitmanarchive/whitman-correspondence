            </opener>

            <p>I received your letter with much pleasure. The facts about Whitman are briefly these. He lives with his brother, &amp; is (I hope &amp; believe) free from any real finish of poverty: but he has little or nothing of his own, &amp; the American public continues to reject his books. He sent me over, for <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">re</unclear>publication in England, an American newspaper notice setting forth in strong terms the unfavorable
                                   
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01883.002.jpg" type="verso"/>side of his position: this I got published in the Atheneum of 11 March. Buchanan saw it there, &amp; sent his letter to the Daily News followed (14 March) by another letter of mine—<choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I infer you have not seen. It said that a friend &amp; I had already written to Whitman bespeaking various copies of his forthcoming books; that I had then asked <choice><abbr>Wh.</abbr><expan>Whitman</expan></choice> whether he <choice><abbr>wd.</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice> like me to push a similar or any other scheme among his admirers here; &amp; that I was (&amp; still I am) awaiting his reply.</p>
            
            <p>Since my D.N. letter several people have written to me offering to buy the books, or <choice><orig status="unremarkable">sub-<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01883.003.jpg" type="recto"/>scribe</orig><reg>subscribe</reg></choice> money: about £25 altogether: &amp; Buchanan has received other similar offers.</p>
            
            <p>I did not see the article in the Standard: there was a very offensive one (not so however to me personally) in last Saturday Review.</p>
            
            <p>I write presently about these matters to <choice><abbr>Wh</abbr><expan>Whitman</expan></choice>—shall apprise him of your letter. When I receive his reply, I shall know exactly what—or whether anything—further <choice><abbr>shd.</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> be done.</p>
