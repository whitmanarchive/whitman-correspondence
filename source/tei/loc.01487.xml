                <salute>Dear Mr. Dowden,<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="Miller"> Dowden
                        (1843&#8211;1913), professor of English literature at the University of
                        Dublin, sent a copy of his article with a letter on July 23, 1871:
                        <!-- "on <ref target="xxx.00000">July 23, 1871</ref>:" --> "I ought to say
                        that the article expresses very partially the impression which your writings
                        have made on me. It keeps, as is obvious, at a single point of view, &#38;
                        regards only what becomes visible from that point. But also I wrote more
                        cooly than I feel because I wanted those, who being ignorant of your
                        writings are perhaps prejudiced against them, to say 'Here is a cool,
                        judicious, impartial critic who finds a great deal in Whitman&#8212;
                        perhaps, after all, we are mistaken'" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection;
                        Horace Traubel, ed., <hi rend="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</hi>
                        (1906&#8211;1964), 5 vols., 1:134). Note also Dowden's comments to
                        Burroughs, in Clara Barrus, <hi rend="italic">Whitman and
                            Burroughs&#8212;Comrades</hi> (1931), 67. On three occasions in 1870
                        Dowden had written to Rossetti about his difficulties in having his article
                        published; see <hi rend="italic">Rossetti Papers</hi>, 517&#8211;518, 519,
                        520. In 1888 Walt Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but he
                        is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
                        (I, 299). </note></salute>

            <p>I have received your kind letter, &#38; your review in the Westminster, &#38; thank
                you heartily. I wish to write you at more length, &#38; may do so before long. I
                take real comfort in the thought that I have such friends in Ireland, including
                yourself. I wish to hear more of Mr. Tyrrell,<note xml:id="n3" type="editorial"
                    resp="miller"> R. Y. Tyrrell, a fellow of Trinity College and "an excellent
                    Greek scholar," had recently delivered a public lecture on Walt Whitman's
