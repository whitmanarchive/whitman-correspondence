        <salute>Dear Nelly,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I sent you the Weekly Graphic No. 2 yesterday&#8212;wish you to take an opportunity, when convenient, 
        &amp; loan it to those two dear ladies, Mrs. Johnson &amp; her sister mentioned in my article<ptr target="nyp.00326_n2"/>&#8212;&amp; please give them my best remembrances. Dear Nelly, how are you getting along, this winter?&#8212;We have just had a snow storm here&#8212;cold &amp; while, as I look out, and the sleigh-bells 
        occasionally jingling by&#8212;I am sitting here alone in the parlor by the heater, 
        as I write. I am alone most of the time, (to all intents &amp; purposes.)
      </p>
      
      <p>I feel that I am better, in the main&#8212;yet still have daily &amp; nightly bad spells in the head, 
        &amp; my leg most of the time disabled as ever. In fact not much different from the same old story&#8212;(yet certainly a good streak, or vein, of encouragement, &amp; feeling of encouragement&#8212;maintaining itself&#8212;accumulating&#8212;never more than temporarily leaving me.) 
        I even begin to think about coming back to Washington &amp; trying it again.
      </p>
      
      <p>Nelly, I sent a P.O. check for $50 to Charley last Friday to pay my young man<ptr target="nyp.00326_n3"/>&#8212;haven't <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> any word from Charley yet, up to this present writing<ptr target="nyp.00326_n4"/>&#8212;hope it came safe&#8212;may hear from him, this afternoon or tomorrow. Charley 
        is always so prompt in responding. I hear regularly from Peter Doyle&#8212;he is well &amp; hearty, works hard for poor pay, on the <choice><abbr>Balt</abbr><expan>Baltimore</expan></choice> &amp; Potomac <choice><abbr>RR</abbr><expan>Railroad</expan></choice>., 
        works nights a great deal. He writes me regularly every week. I have been 
        waiting ever since I wrote,<ptr target="nyp.00326_n5"/> to get the photos. of my nieces, (my dear sister Mat's girls,) returned from New York, &amp; send them to you&#8212;but have not yet got them. Shall write for them. My "song of <hi rend="italic">the redwood tree</hi>," 
        in last Harpers is copied a little, &amp; abused &amp; sneered at in the newspaper criticisms, 
        a good deal, (from what I glean)&#8212;<hi rend="italic">of course</hi>, that last makes me feel <hi rend="italic">very bad</hi>&#8212;I expect to have another piece in February<ptr target="nyp.00326_n6"/> Harpers&#8212;(but am not certain)&#8212;"prayer of Columbus"&#8212;as I see it now I shouldn't wonder if I have unconsciously put a sort of biographical dash in it&#8212;Nelly dear, write oftener&#8212;put in all the gossip &amp; items that will be next best to seeing you&#8212;do you see Dr. Drinkard&#8212;I sent Garaphelia Howard<ptr target="nyp.00326_n7"/> a paper, the Graphic<ptr target="nyp.00326_n8"/> that has my picture&#8212;how is she? Is she married? Give her my love&#8212;Poor, good Mr. Dille<ptr target="nyp.00326_n9"/>&#8212;yet amid all its sombreness &amp; terror how blessed to die "by touch ethereal," 
        painless, instantaneous&#8212;Nelly, death has become to me a familiar thing&#8212;Yet, as I sit here writing, 
        I do not feel a particle less of life in me, than ever.
