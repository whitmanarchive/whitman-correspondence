            <p>Burnside's army passed through here yesterday&#8212;I saw George &amp; walked with him in the regiment for some distance &amp; had quite a talk&#8212;he is very well, he is very much tanned &amp; looks hardy, I told him all the latest news from home&#8212;George stands it very well, &amp; looks &amp; behaves the same good &amp; noble fellow he always was &amp; always will be&#8212;it was on 14th st.&#8212;I watched three hours before the 51st came along&#8212;I joined him just before they came to where the President &amp; Gen Burnside were standing with others on a balcony, &amp; the interest of seeing me &amp;c. made George forget to notice the President &amp; salute him&#8212;he was a little annoyed at forgetting it&#8212;I called his attention to it, but we had passed a little too far on, &amp; George wouldn't turn round even ever so little&#8212;however there was a great many (more than half the army) passed without noticing Mr Lincoln &amp; the others, for there was a great crowd all through the streets, especially here, &amp; the place where the President stood was not conspicuous from the rest&#8212; The 9th Corps made a very fine show indeed&#8212;there were I should think five very full regiments of new black troops under Gen Ferrero,<ptr target="loc.00819_n1"/> they looked &amp; marched very well&#8212;It looked funny to see the President standing with his hat off to them just the same as the rest as they passed by&#8212;then there [were] Michigan regiments, one of them was a reg't of sharpshooters, partly composed of indians&#8212;then there was a pretty strong force of artillery&#8212;&amp; a middling force of cavalry, many New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, R[hode] I[sland], &amp;c reg'ts&#8212;all except the blacks were veterans, seen plenty of fighting&#8212;Mother, it is very different to see a real army of fighting men, from one of those shows in Brooklyn, or New York, or on fort Greene&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, it was a curious sight to see these ranks after ranks of our own dearest blood of men, mostly young, march by, worn &amp; sunburnt &amp; sweaty, with well worn clothes &amp; their bundles &amp; knapsacks, tin cups &amp; some with frying pans, strapt over their backs, all dirty &amp; sweaty&#8212;nothing real neat about them except their muskets, but they were all as clean &amp; bright as silver&#8212;they were four or five hours passing along, marching with wide ranks pretty quickly too&#8212;it is a great sight to see such a big Army, 25 or 30,000, on the march&#8212;they are all so gay too, poor fellows&#8212;nothing dampens their spirits&#8212;they all got soaked with rain the night before&#8212;I saw Fred McReady &amp; Capt Sims, &amp; Col LeGendre<ptr target="loc.00819_n2"/> &amp;c&#8212;I dont know exactly where Burnside's army is going&#8212;among other rumors it is said they [are] to go [with] the Army of the Potomac to act as a reserve force, &amp;c&#8212;another is that they are to make a flank march, to go round &amp; get Lee on the side &amp;c&#8212;We know nothing&#8212;I havn't been out this morning &amp; dont know what news, only that there is without doubt to be a terrible campaign here in Virginia this summer, &amp; that all who know deepest about it, are very serious about it&#8212;Mother, it is serious times&#8212;I do not feel to fret or whimper, but in my heart &amp; soul about our country, the army, the forthcoming campaign with all its vicissitudes &amp; the wounded &amp; slain&#8212;I dare say, Mother, I feel the reality more than some because I [am] in the midst of its saddest results so much&#8212;Others may say what they like, I believe in Grant &amp; in Lincoln too&#8212;I think Grant deserves to be trusted, he is working continually&#8212;no one knows his plans, we will only know them when he puts them in operation&#8212;Our Army is very large here in Virginia this spring &amp; they are still pouring in from east &amp; west&#8212;you dont see about it in the papers, but we have very large army here&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I am first rate in health, thank God, I never was better&#8212;dear mother, have you got all over that distress &amp; sickness in your head? You must write particular about it&#8212;Dear brother Jeff, how are you, &amp; how is Matty?&#8212;&amp; how the dear little girls&#8212;Jeff, I believe the devil is in it about my writing you, I have laid out so many weeks to write you a good long letter, &amp; something has shoved it off each time&#8212;never mind, mother's letters keep you posted&#8212;you must write &amp; don't forget to tell me all about sis, is she as good &amp; interesting as she was six months ago? Mother, have you heard any thing from Han? Mother, I have just had my breakfast, I had it in my room, some hard biscuits warmed on stove, &amp; a first rate bowl of strong tea, with good milk &amp; sugar&#8212;I have given a Michigan soldier<ptr target="loc.00819_n3"/> his breakfast with me, he relished it too, he has just gone&#8212;Mother, I have just heard again that Burnside's troops are to be a reserve to protect Washington, so there may be something in it&#8212;</p>
