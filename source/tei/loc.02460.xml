            </opener>

            <p>By this mail I send you the current number of <hi rend="underline">The Strand
                    Magazine</hi>&#8212;a new English periodical&#8212;mainly because it contains
                (p. 41) portraits of your old friend Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/>, at two different
                periods of his life, which I thought might interest you.</p>

            <p>J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> called at my Surgery this morning &#38; read to me the
                draft of a letter to you concerning Ruskin<ptr target="n3013"/> which I think will
                please you. This is the most sacred of days to him (JWW), being the anniversary of
                his mother's death, which was at once the greatest calamity of his life &#38; his
                most valuable experience</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02460.004.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>He was just returning from the Cemetery where he had probably been placing a wreath
                upon her grave.</p>

            <p>It is a constant source of regret to his friends here that his health continues so
                indifferent&#8212;he is looking better tho' still complaining of a lack of nerve
                energy&#8212;this enforced absence form the Monday night weekly meetings of "The
                College" has been a misfortune for our little society of friends, among whom he is
                    <hi rend="underline">facile princeps</hi>, &#38; who are proud to acknowledge
                him Master.</p>

            <p>"The dear fellow!" you exclaimed while reading the letter from him that I handed to
                you last July in your "Mickle St den". Yes, he is a dear fellow! How dear &#38; how
                good no one knows better than I who am privileged to enjoy his closest personal</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02460.005.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>intimacy&#8212;He is a man of Sterling worth &#38; his qualities of mind &#38; heart
                have endeared him to all who really <hi rend="underline">know</hi> him&#8212;Few men
                possess a better knowledge than he of what is essentially the highest &#38; best in
                Literature, or a more keen &#38; penetrating insight into the heart &#38; meaning of
                the Deliverances of the Great Ones of Earth, the "conscience conserving, God
                inculcting, inspired acheivers" the "powerful &#38; resplendent" poets, scientists
                &#38; seers of the glorious past &#38; the equally &#38; perhaps more glorious
                    present.<ptr target="loc.02460_n2"/></p>

            <p>He is really an all round splendid fellow intellectually &#38; morally&#8212;Gifted
                with a mind of a superior order he is endowed with an exalted moral nature &#38; has
                attained true nobility of character.</p>

            <p>I cannot tell you all he has been to me or how much</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02460.006.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I owe to his good influence; for he has been one of three good genii of my
                life&#8212;the other two being yourself &#38; my own, dear, good old father. I have
                no truer friend&#8212;our friendship originated in &#38; has been fused &#38; welded
                into intimate &#38;, I trust, life long cohesion mainly through our mutual love for
                you&#8212;and you have no warmer, whole-heart-and-soul-devoted admirer, appreciator
                &#38; lover than he</p>

            <p>Pardon my writing thus about my friend but "out of the abundance of the heart the
                mouth speaketh".<ptr target="loc.02460_n3"/> &#38; I know that my words will need no
                apology to <hi rend="underline">you</hi> since it is in great measure thro' you that
                I have learned to appreciate &#38; love such as he.</p>

            <p>This morning I recd a p.c. from W Sloane Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/>, of which the
                following is a copy:&#8212;</p>

            <p>Jan 9 '91</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for the delightful poem on Walt W. I read it through with zest.

                but this morning King Frost returned in all his rigour &#38; donned his ermine robe.
                It has been snowing most of the day &#38; it has not yet (8pm) ceased.</p>

            <p>The Curator of the Bolton Museum has just been in to make arrangements for the
                removal of my Sidney Morse<ptr target="duk.00863_n3"/> painting of you to the walls
                of the Exhibition this week</p>

            <p>I trust you are keeping better &#38; are free from pain &#38; distress</p>

            <p>With my kindest regards to all your household &#38; with best heart love to
