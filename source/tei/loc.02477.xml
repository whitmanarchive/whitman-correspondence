            </opener>
            <p>Just a line or two to acknowledge the receipt, this morning, of your kind p.c. of May
                    8<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02477_n2"/> &amp; to send you my
                heartfelt thanks for it.</p>
            <p>I took it to Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> who shewed me a good long letter he had
                    rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> from Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> in which
                he gives us some interesting details concerning you and suggests sending <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02477.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> your canary bird
                to him<ptr target="loc.08056_n2b"/>—<hi rend="underline">that</hi> we should prize very highly indeed, as
                coming direct from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>.</p>
            <p>It was with deep regret that we read on your p.c. of your "bad three weeks" &amp;
                that the "same subject" was "continued"; but how like you to say that you are "still
                not dislodged" &amp; that you have "hope of sending us better accts. by &amp;
                by"!</p>  
            <p>From this p.c. &amp; from Warry's letter we can partly realize how poorly you
                continue, but even <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02477.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                that does not prevent your sitting "up in the big chair &amp; writing" to us
                &amp; sending your love &amp; your benediction across the seas to us in token of
                your abiding affection, for which we send you our warmest appreciative thanks &amp;
                our loving greeting.</p>
            <p>Warry tells us that you will probably have a few friends with you on your birthday<ptr target="wau.00003_n3"/>
                &amp; that you will not risk going out of your own house even tho' there may be a
                gathering <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02477.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> in
                your honour in the town—This, I think, is wise, under the circumstances, as
                the inevitable excitement would probably be injurious to you—</p>
            <p>I only hope that you will be no worse for what the day will entail upon you even at
                home.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt that the numerous messages of love &amp; sympathy from your "dear
                friends, your lovers," in all parts of the world will hearten &amp; cheer you in no
                ordinary way.</p>
            <p>I hope Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> will be able to be with you. <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02477.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>If so will you
                please convey my kindest regards &amp; best wishes to him? </p>
            <p>We hope most earnestly that the 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi> will find you in
                better health than you have had lately &amp; that you may have a truly happy
                birthday.</p>
            <p>We shall not allow the occasion to pass without special recognition and observance
                tho' the fact of its being on a Sunday this year will compel us to modify our usual
                custom. But whatever we do the day will be <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02477.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> full of tender &amp; loving
                thoughts of <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. </p>

                    p.m.</hi></p> 
            <p>At noon today my eyes were gladdened by the rec<hi rend="underline">t</hi> of a copy
                of the <hi rend="underline">New England Magazine</hi> for May containing H. L.
                Traubel's<ptr target="n4267"/> most interesting article upon you "to date,"<ptr target="loc.02477_n3"/>
                &amp; I thank you most heartily for your kindness in sending it. Later I rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> the ordered
                copies from H. L. T. himself.</p>
            <p>It is a great pleasure to me to see some of <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02477.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> my photographs reproduced in an
                article by such a warm-hearted friend &amp; such a ready penman as our dear H. L. T.
                And it is an honour too of wh: I am indeed proud, because it associates me with <hi rend="underline">you</hi> in a permanent form.</p>
            <p>The article itself is characterised by all the graphic power, enthusiastic fervour,
                &amp; literary skill of pourtrayal which distinguishes H.L.T.'s work.</p>
            <p>But I fear this letter is already too long—at a time too when you will <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02477.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> be burdened with
                an extra heavy mail.</p>
            <p>I send you a copy of <hi rend="underline">"Pictures of 1891"</hi><ptr target="loc.02477_n6"/> which it may interest you to look through 
                sometime. At page 106 is a reproduction
                of Whistler's<ptr target="loc.02477_n5"/> portrait of Carlyle.<ptr target="n4301"/></p>
            <p>With kindest regards to all your household—please thank Warry &amp; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> for their kind remembrance
                of me in Warry's letter—&amp; with best love to yourself</p>
