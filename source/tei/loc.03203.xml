            <p>The old war refrain&#8212;"All's quiet on the Potomac"&#8212;seems to have a new
                rendering in my thought as I go about my daily work: "All silent in Camden." I hear
                nothing &#38; see nothing in the public prints. But I dare say if I could cross the
                old ferry &#38; stop at "328"&#8212;I suppose you still insist on your own
                number&#8212;I should find life enough vocal &#38; contented.</p>

            <p>I frequently chance upon your friends here in this city.</p>

            <p>One such wrote a 2 column article for the <hi rend="underline">Evening Journal</hi>
                of May 31. He allows me to send it to you on condition that I will charge you to <hi

                    >responded</unclear>,&#8212;"Serenely." But he is a bit mad, &#38; says he has
                long been so knowing the "sham" that <choice>

                </choice> is.</p>

            <p>This man's name is Henry Latchford<ptr target="n5000"/>. He was sent to me the other day by Mr Dalton<ptr target="n5000"/>, the
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">Ethical
                preacher</unclear>. He seems a man of ideas &#38; good sympathies&#8212;is a
                journalist&#8212;independent; that is, not attached to one journal, but writing for
                several on topics of his own selection. He came and chatted with me an hour ago.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03203.004.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>and, in departing, asked permission to write a paragraph for the journal about my
                work. I enclose the "paragraph." He got some things mixed &#38; not as I would have
                had it stand, had I seen the proof&#8212;or knowing he was going to "repeat" at such
                length. One thing, I would not have spoken of your Georgia friend<ptr target="n0914"/> as a "nuisance."
                Nor did I imply. I recall just what I said. "He stayed some time &#38; almost came
                to be a nuisance, but made up for</p>

                I have always kept green a kind feeling for the old man, for there was something
                rather poetic in his leaving his home &#38; journeying so far to see the man whose
                poems had so much interested him. Peace be to him, any way, &#38; may he not see
                this half-unkind printed word of mine.</p>

            <p>Nor did I say that you got "tired &#38; sloppy." I think I said something about your
                sitting silently</p>

                question he puts in print at all. But it fitted in for him to report that <unclear

            <p>But he made the worst mess about the Holmes talk, &#38; my contempt for <hi
                    rend="underline">facts</hi>. I was only arguing as to what the <hi

                criticism&#8212;or fault-finding, tinkering criticism. That was where "brains" got
                in the way. Holmes never cried, "Hold on!" &#38;c, but told the little story
                accidentally one</p>

            <p>Latchford likes the Whitman bust as represented in part of Horace's<ptr target="n4267"/> book. He laughed
                out&#8212;"Its more like Walt than anything I've ever seen&#8212;"</p>

            <p>Well, I am here yet in</p>

                friends&#8212;more friends than money, &#38; I suppose that is as it should be. If
                they could not forever be taking <hi rend="underline">me</hi> for a millionaire! Its
                awkward when your <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#bbb"

                enough spend time &#38; dollars for their good pleasure. I manage after a fashion to
                either conquer or disgust them.</p>

                like you Camden folk to see it, but dont see how you can.</p>

            <p>I find myself drawing toward a renewal of the little statue first began in your
                parlor. I can reproduce that from memory, I go on with it; but incline to some
