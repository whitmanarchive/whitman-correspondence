                <salute>Dear Walt,—</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The old war refrain—"All's quiet on the Potomac"<ptr target="loc.03203_n4"/>—seems 
                to have a new
                rendering in my thought as I go about my daily work: "All silent in Camden." I hear
                nothing &amp; see nothing in the public prints. But I dare say if I could cross the
                old ferry &amp; stop at "328"—I suppose you still insist on your own
                number—I should find life enough vocal &amp; contented.</p>

            <p>I frequently chance upon your friends here in this city. <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03203.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> One such wrote a 2 column article for
                the <hi rend="underline">Evening Journal</hi> of May 31. He allows me to send it to
                you on condition that I will charge you to <hi rend="underline">return it</hi>, as
                it is the only copy he owns, &amp; wishes it for his <hi rend="underline">scrap
                    book.</hi> He is an Englishman—knows George Elliot,<ptr target="n3044"/>
                    Tennyson,<ptr target="n0625"/> Carpenter,<ptr target="n0141b"/> I believe &amp;
                others. Prof Dowden<ptr target="n0199"/> of Somersham—one of your English
                friends, is his friend. He detests Swinburn,<ptr target="n0610"/> &amp; will have an
                article in <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> Sunday on Gladstone's<ptr target="loc.01354_n2"/> saying that .S would be next poet-laureate.
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03203.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

                He asked how you took Swinburn's "apostacy." I answered,—"Serenely." But he is
                a bit mad, &amp; says he has long been so knowing the "sham" that Swinburn is.</p> 

            <p>This man's name is Henry Latchford.<ptr target="n7053"/> He was sent to me the other
                day by Mr Dalton, the Ethical preacher here.<ptr target="loc.03203_n6"/> He seems a man of ideas &amp; good
                sympathies—is a journalist—independent; that is, not attached to one
                journal, but writing for several on topics of his own selection. He came and chatted
                with me an hour or so, <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03203.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                and, on departing, asked permission to write a paragraph for the journal about my
                work. I enclose the "paragraph." He got some things mixed &amp; not as I would have
                had it stand, had I seen the proof—or knowing he was going to "report" at such
                length. One thing, I would not have spoken of your Georgia friend<ptr target="n0914"/> as a "nuisance." Nor did I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">imply</unclear>. I recall just what I said. "He stayed some time
                &amp; almost came to be a nuisance, but made up for

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03203.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

              it in part at least, by the bright things he would say, &amp; then told "old varmint"
                    story.<ptr target="loc.03203_n2"/> I have always kept green a kind feeling for
                the old man, for there was something rather poetic in his leaving his home &amp;
                journeying so far to see the man whose poems had so much interested him. Peace be to
                him, any way, &amp; may he not see this half-unkind printed word of mine.</p>

            <p>Nor did I quite say that you get "tired &amp; sleepy." I think I said something about
                your sitting silently <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03203.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                museing—or something like that. I don't remember that he asked me the question
                he puts in print at all. But it fitted in for him to report that <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#bbb">"property" recital</unclear>.</p>

            <p>But he made the worst mess about the Holmes<ptr target="loc.04995_n1"/> talk, &amp; my
                contempt for <hi rend="underline">facts</hi>. I was only arguing as to what the <hi rend="underline">fact</hi> is, in any portraiture, &amp; against reliance on the
                merely critical faculty—the <hi rend="underline">conscious</hi>
                criticism—or fault-finding, tinkering criticism. That was where "brains" got
                in the way. Holmes never cried, "Hold on!" &amp;c, but told the little story
                accidentally one <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03203.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                day.</p>
           
            <p>But—its all in a life time. All sores heal now-a-days inside a week.</p>

            <p>I mean to send some George Elliot plaques to Camden when I get them out—The
                original is done—&amp; waits only for duplicates.</p>

            <p>Latchford likes the Whitman bust as represented in front of Horace's<ptr target="n4267"/> book.<ptr target="loc.03203_n5"/> He laughed out—"Its more like Walt than anything
                I've ever seen."</p> 

            <p>Well, I am here yet in <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.03203.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                the toils—trying to sing cheerily—"Blessed be poverty." I have many
                friends—more friends than money, &amp; I suppose that is as it should be. If
                they could not forever be taking me for a millionaire! Its awkward when your pennies
                are few to have it expected that thus you will easily enough spend time &amp;
                dollars for their good pleasure. I manage after a fashion to either conquer or
                disgust them.

            <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.03203.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            I calculate that H. is busy, busy. I see his articles now &amp; then in "New
                Ideal."</p>

            <p>Chicago is after the World's Fair<ptr target="loc.05422_n1"/> with a vengence on all contesters. Its so like Chicago. I never was in
                so <choice>
                    <sic>partizan</sic>
                    <corr>partisan</corr>
                </choice> an atmosphere, as I encounter here by Lake Michigan. You <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be "d___d sure" of Everything, or you are nobody. You
                don't count. You're like the democrats in Speaker <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.03203.010_large.jpg" type="verso"/> Reed's<ptr target="loc.03203_n3"/>
                house; present, yet absent.</p>  

            <p>I've made a little painting of you which is by far the best <hi rend="underline">painting</hi> I have ever done. I expect to sell it to a lady here in C. I'd
                like you Camden folk to see it, but dont see how you can.</p>

            <p>I find myself drawing toward a renewal of the little statue first began in your
                parlor. I can reproduce that from memory, &amp; go on with it; but incline to some
                change in posture.</p> 

            <p>Is Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> still with you—Give her my best regards. I
                remember the old kitchen, &amp; all things well. And Aunt Mary.</p>

            <p>If you can, send me a line. If not, tell Horace to send it &amp; one for himself</p>
