            <p>My heart's best gratitude to you beloved Master &amp; Friend for your magnificent Letter 
                of march 30th &amp; 31st<ptr target="loc.02473_n2"/> which reached me on Sunday last 
                (Ap 11th) &amp; wh I at once sent on to J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> as you desired.</p>            
            <p>What can we say to you or do for you in return for this overpowering proof of your affectionate regard for us?</p>            
            <p>We find ourselves constantly marvelling at your unstinted generosity and            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02473.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>            
                loving-kindness toward us &amp; we have of late been almost daily congratulating ourselves 
                upon our good fortune in being favoured with so many communications from you; but that you 
                should take the trouble of writing such a long &amp; interesting letter to us not only fills 
                us with wonder mixed with pride but affects us very deeply indeed.</p>            
            <p>Thanks, &amp; again thanks to you for it generous hearted Benefactor!</p>            
            <p>Your letter was especially welcome because of the            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02473.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>            
                real good news it contained about you. For it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> gladsome tiding 
                for us to know that you are "getting along fairly, considering" that you "have no vehement 
                pain night or day that you make acc't of" that you can get 5 or 6 hours sleep &amp; that your 
                most distressing symptoms are now so much relieved</p>            
            <p>The cheeriness which pervades your letter gladdens our hearts &amp; inspires us with the hope 
                that thanks to your originally superb physique &amp; your noble &amp;            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02473.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>            
                indomitable fortitude &amp; "pluck" you will yet weather this storm as you have done so many before</p>            
            <p>After your long &amp; tedious seclusion you must be longing for the fresh air, the sunshine &amp; 
                the sense of freedom which out-of-doors influences inspire.</p>            
            <p>What a joy it will be for you to awake from your hibernation &amp; to get out side once more! How 
                I wish that I could be privileged to accompany you &amp; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> upon 
                your first excursion down to the wharf            
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02473.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>            
                to participate with you in the pleasures of the delicious air, the sunshine upon the River, the 
                groups of little children, the workmen, the teamsters, the ceaseless movements to &amp; fro of 
                the ferry boats &amp; all the <choice><sic>exhilirating</sic><corr>exhilarating</corr></choice> 
                sights &amp; sounds of Camden Ferry!</p>            
            <p>As I write this my mind reverts to that inexpressibly happy July evening of last year when I sat 
                by your side, facing the golden sunset, drinking in the varied delights of the place, enjoying 
                your tenderly sweet companionship &amp; listening            
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02473.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>            
                to the sound of your "valved voice";<ptr target="loc.02473_n4b"/> and I seem to live over again those two red letter—nay 
                rather epoch-making—days of my life which I spent with <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, my dear, 
                old Camerado &amp; Elder Brother.</p>            
            <p>Would that I were with you now! But alas! We are separated by 3000 miles of sea. But we <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> surely meet again!</p>            
            <p>I am glad that you like Dr Longaker<ptr target="loc.08039_n2"/> &amp; "his doings" &amp; I thank 
                you for kindly favouring me with his address. I am writing a short letter to him

            <p>We had another Whitman gathering at The College<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/> last night (April 14th) Some of the friends came 
                to my house &amp; J.W.W. read your "Lincoln" Lecture<ptr target="med.00797_n1b"/> and "When lilacs 
                last in the dooryard bloomed"<ptr target="n0694b"/> in his best style!</p>            
            <p>We wondered under what circumstances you were reading the Lecture as we felt persuaded that you 
                would not allow the day to pass without keeping up your hitherto annual custom in some fashion</p>            
            <p>By this mail we are sending you the <hi rend="underline">Review of</hi>            
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02473.010_large.jpg" type="verso"/>            
                <hi rend="underline">Reviews</hi><ptr target="loc.04333_n2"/> which contains several items which will interest you see pp 
                321—on which <hi rend="underline">you</hi> are seen dancing hand in hand with Amelie 
                Rives<ptr target="n4280"/>—366 &amp; 378.</p>            
            <p>By the way I am sending a copy of yr last letter to Symonds.<ptr target="n0615"/></p>            
            <p>I also send you a copy of this weeks issue of <hi rend="underline">Great Thoughts</hi><ptr target="loc.02450_n5"/> containing 
                portrait of &amp; article on Charles Berry<ptr target="loc.02473_n5"/>—a Lancashire man stationed for sometime in Bolton, who 
                had the courage to refuse the succession to your Henry Ward Beecher<ptr target="loc.02473_n3"/> in Brooklyn.</p>           
            <p>I had got this far with my letter (3.20 PM) when the postman brought me a long &amp; most interesting 
                letter about you from "Warry," which            
            <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02473.011_large.jpg" type="recto"/>            
                confirms the previous good news about your improved condition. He says that Dr Longaker seems to 
                have done you a great deal of good &amp; that he hopes before long to be able to take you down to 
                the wharf—where I took your photograph &amp; had such a good time with you &amp; him &amp; 
                the first place that he intends taking you to—</p>            
            <p>He also says that Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> intends paying you a visit, if he can, on your birthday. 
                <hi rend="underline">That</hi>

                will do you good I am sure &amp; I hope you will be able to stand the inevitable excitement of that event.</p>            
            <p>I took Warry's letter to J.W.W.'s office. Fortunately I found him in &amp; upon reading the letter he 
                exclaimed:—"Warry is a trump!"—and so say all of us. He <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a trump. 
                His letter is full of his characteristic cheeriness <hi rend="underline">bonhommie</hi> &amp; warm-hearted 
                friendliness, and we are glad

            <p>But I must close as I have other duties awaiting my attention.</p>            
            <p>Will you please kindly convey my warmest thanks to Warry for his kind letter &amp; tell him that I will write to him shortly?</p>
