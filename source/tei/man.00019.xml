                <salute/>Dear Walt:</opener>

            <p>A friend of yours in Boston sends through me a little New Years gift.<ptr target="n0129"/> It comes from a
                good fellow. I wish I could duplicate it. I went over to Boston to the Holmes<ptr target="n3024"/>
                breakfast &amp; had a pleasant time, I saw Emerson &amp; spoke with him. He seemed
                to grope about in his mind for some <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="man_ej.00177.jpg" type="verso"/>clew as to who I was, but I hardly
                think he placed me, though I told him the names of my books. There seems to be a
                fearful chasm in his mind &amp; he is hardly able to bridge it over, in conversation.
                He does not remember the name of his own State. Whittier<ptr target="n1029"/> was standing by him &amp;
                hearing my name, said to Emerson, "oh! thee knows him" with much emphasis. I
                then spoke to Whittier: he seemed to know me well &amp; said he had read all I had
                published &amp; was complimentary. Emerson is thin &amp; sharp &amp; his hair is
                about gone. He seemed to eat well &amp; to enjoy the <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="man_ej.00178.jpg" type="recto"/>fun. He wears the same look as of
                old. Holmes greeted me very heartily &amp; said many pleasant things to me. Fields<ptr target="n0231b"/>
                was very cordial &amp; wanted me to stay at his house, a Mrs Fairchilds asked to be
                introduced to me to tell me how much she admired you &amp; your poems &amp;c. I went
                out to Arlington &amp; saw Trowbridge<ptr target="n0860"/> He is well &amp; made many inquiries about
                you. He has several children by his second wife, &amp; they have a pleasant home.&#8212;I
                am making trips to <choice>
                    <abbr>N.Y.</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice> <choice>
                    <sic>now adays</sic>
                    <corr>nowadays</corr>
                </choice> to be treated for my arm &amp; hand. The Doctor says it is
                Neuritis, inflammation of the nerves of <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="man_ej.00020.jpg" type="verso"/>the arm. He cauterizes my back &amp;
                arm with a red hot piece of platinum. I go again in the morning &amp; shall stay
                down several days. The rest are all well here. I send the baby's picture taken in
                October. He runs all about now &amp; begins to talk; Smith &amp; his family are
                well. Mother mends a little. We have had a touch of winter here, &amp; the river is
                frozen over, but to-day it is thawing again. Write, I hope you are coming East
                soon.</p>

                <salute>With much love from us all &amp; a happy new year to you,</salute>
