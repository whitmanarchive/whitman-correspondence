            <p>Pain and joy struggle together in me (but joy getting the mastery, because its portion 
                is eternal) O the precious letter, bearing to me the living touch of your hand, vibrating 
                through &amp; through me as I feel the pressure of the ring that pressed your flesh &amp;

            <p>When my eyes first open in the

                flow into my breast that longs &amp; longs to pillow on itself the suffering head (with 
                white hair more beautiful to me than the silvery clouds which always make me think of

                children send their love, their earnest sympathy. Do not feel anyways called on to write 
                except when inwardly impelled. Your silence is not dumb to me now—will never again 
                cloud or pain, or be misconstrued by me. I can feast &amp; feast, &amp; still have wherewithal 
                to satisfy myself with the sweet &amp; precious words that have now come &amp; with the 
                feel of my ring,

                only send any old paper that comes to hand (never mind whether there is anything to read 
                in it or not) just as a sign that the breath of love &amp; hope these poor words try to 
                bear to you, has reached. And just one word literally that, Dearest, when you begin to feel 
                you are really getting on—to make me so joyful with the news.</p>
