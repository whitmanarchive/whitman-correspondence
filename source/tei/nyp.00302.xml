        <salute>Dear Nelly,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter has reached me this morning&#8212;&amp;, as always, is welcome&#8212;I shall <hi rend="italic">not go on</hi> to Boston&#8212;am not well enough 
        (&amp; the hot spell besides)&#8212;but shall send the piece I have composed 
        for the occasion&#8212;a ten or fifteen minute piece I call the "Song of the Universal"&#8212;to be read by proxy in its place in the programme, just the same as though I were there. 
        I will next week send it you in print<ptr target="nyp.00302_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I am only reconciled to Charles Eldridge's <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming to see me Decoration Day, by taking it 
        for granted that he will consequently feel bound to visit me without fail before long&#8212;Come, Charley, by all means&#8212;It will do me good&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Nelly, John Burroughs has had a terrible &amp; sudden sorrow befall him&#8212;the sudden insanity &amp; death 
        of his young nephew, his dead sister's son, (he visited me here during the past winter) Chancy Burroughs,<ptr target="nyp.00302_n3"/> at Brooklyn two weeks since&#8212;Abruptly, mysteriously, from <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> health &amp; strength he became 
        a raging maniac &amp; died in three days&#8212;&amp; J. B. took up the poor young man's corpse &amp; buried him 
        by his mother's side, there in the mountains of Delaware County&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>If I remember right the picture in the gilt frame is the one with the hand up at the right side of the head&#8212;so? If so, I have some of them, &amp; will give Mrs. Johnson one with the greatest pleasure&#8212;(it is one of 
        Brady's photos)&#8212;I wish you to give my best respects &amp; love to Mrs. J. and sister&#8212;Also to Garry Howard, 
        Mrs. Huntington, Mrs. Brownell &amp; in fact to "all inquiring friends"&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I still maintain the "great expectations" I have before mentioned&#8212;the severe gastric affection, 
        trouble in side &amp; breast, &amp;c still assert themselves at times&#8212;dyspepsia, from 17 months inaction&#8212;but upon the whole not so severely&#8212;&amp; I think very decidedly gradually growing less&#8212;The worst is my singular alternations, fluctuations. The heat here too is &amp; has been extreme&#8212;but I am standing it well, so far&#8212;to-day as I sit here writing, a fair breeze blowing in&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Peter Doyle has ten days since paid me a short visit of a couple of days<ptr target="nyp.00302_n4"/>&#8212;the dear, dear boy&#8212;&amp; what good it did me!&#8212;(Unfortunately it was, however, 
        at a time when I was feeling almost at my worst.) Yesterday George Bacon came, bringing a friend&#8212;&amp; we had a capital good hour &amp; a half&#8212;<hi rend="italic">talked Spiritualism</hi>&#8212;I enjoyed it though&#8212;</p>
