                </choice> passion" among your friends than perhaps you are aware of. Though we do
                not set up and curse the (modern) Pharisees as Christ (or far more likely his
                friends did) yet we feel it. It is <hi rend="underline">there</hi> all the same. We 
                do not and cannot go with
                    Ingersoll<ptr target="n0839"/> in his refusals and denials but we like the man
                and we should be foolish to do anything to deter him from giving us his
                friendship<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_sd.00028.jpg" type="verso"/> and support. We want the conservative, orthodox folk (all we can get of them) and we
                are getting a good many (I have a letter this morning from a young presbytarian 
                <choice><sic>clergiman</sic><corr>clergyman</corr></choice>&#8212;a good 
                friend of yours<ptr target="n5001"/>) but we want (to my
                mind) the independent freethinkers even more since the immediate future (I fancy)
                belongs to them. I think you are right to stand aside (personally) from this
                I.<ptr target="loc.07113_n5"/> demonstration<ptr target="loc.07113_n3"/> but for my part (as a friend
                of the cause) I look upon it (and think you should) with great complacency. I think
                therefore that you are entirely wrong to be "annoyed" at a demonstration in your
                favor even if it were entirely by freethinker&#8212;they cannot alter you or your
                teaching and (on the contrary) you will undoubtedly, in the end, alter many of them
                and will have (in the end) in all probability your most extreme partisans &#38;
                lovers from this section of humanity. As for I. being "solicited" it seems to me
                that is neither here nor there&#8212;your friends have a right to do what seems best
                to them in such matters&#8212;their action does not affect you&#8212;you stand aside
                and let them act. That is all. For my part nothing <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_sd.00029.jpg" type="recto"/> could give 
                me greater satisfaction than a rousing demonstration on the part of I. and
                his friends and I shall take part in it (if I can) with a good heart. I do heartily
                agree with you however in wishing that the affair<ptr target="loc.07113_n4"/> could come off in N.Y. Could not
                this be managed? I shall write to Johnston<ptr target="n0336"/> on this point.</p>
