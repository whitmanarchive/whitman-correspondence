                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman.</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Before the old year is closing I will send you a few lines only to express the hope,
                that you may enter into the new year in an ameliorated <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">state</unclear> of health mind and body! Your answer to
                my letter from <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#ej">Garsdal</unclear>
                I duely received. A <choice>
                    <sic>forthnight</sic>
                    <corr>fortnight</corr>
                </choice> after the receipt of it I sent you a number of Danish <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ej">Kolkets dent</unclear> (Danish
                people's paper) with a criticism of your book by Mr Termansen<!-- <ptr target="n0423"/> -->&#8212;a very bad
                one.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01913.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>The author is a peasant, member of one Danish house of the Commons, originally a
                gifted man, but at present one of the spoiled <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ej">dalsegs</unclear> of the haut ton Copenhagen society. Even into the
                greatest assemblies he appears in the coarse Luffs of the Danish peasants' home
                dress;&#8212;vanity! He is one of what Bjornion <!-- unsure of this word -NNK -->
                with a very happy expression calls <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#nnk">them</unclear> pale-born peasants.</p>

            <p>If you have had the criticisms especially Elate's <!-- who is this?-->, completely
                translated for you I should like to know what impression all these foreign judgments
                may have made <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01913.003.jpg" type="recto"/>on you.
                The least benevolent of them are, you will allow, far more benevolent than your
                homely American criticism. But you have many friends, male and female, here, who
                don't write criticisms.</p>

            <p>I have been <choice>
                    <sic>accostumed</sic>
                    <corr>accustomed</corr>
                </choice> to receive papers and small parcels from you and have always been glad for
                it, even when I forgot to share you. In the last five months I have received
                nothing. Earnestly hoping that the reason may not be, that your illness has
                increased</p>
