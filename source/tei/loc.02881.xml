            </opener>

            <p>I have run down to Colne for a glimpse of my dear Bee<!-- <ptr target="loc.02881_n1"/> --> whom I had not seen for five months,
                &amp; of my Mother, &amp; now I am alone with the latter, Beatrice taking my place
                at home with her brother &amp; sister for a week or two. A wonderful evergreen my
                Mother continues; still able to face the keen winds &amp; the frost daily in her
                Bath chair&#8212;well swathed of course in eiderdown &amp; flannels. Beatrice takes
                beautiful care of her &amp; is happy &amp; content with her life here, loving the
                country as dearly as I do &amp; having time enough for study &amp; reading as well
                as for domestic activities to keep her mind as busy as her body. How I do long for
                you to see my children, dearest Friend. I wonder if you are surrounded with any in
                your brother's home&#8212;young growing <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02881.002.jpg" type="verso"/> blossoming plants that gladden you. And
                I wonder if the winter which I hear is so severe in America this year, tries
                you&#8212; whether you can yet move briskly enough to keep up the
                circulation&#8212;and whether you have as many dear friends round you as you had at
                Washington. In my walks I keep thinking of these things. Write me a little letter
                once more, it would do me such good. No one of all your friends so easy as I to
                write to, because none to whom any &amp; every little detail is so welcome, so
                precious,&#8212;lifting a tiny corner of the great vast of space between us giving
                me for a moment to feel the friendly grasp of your hand&#8212;I that long for it
                so.&#8212;Two years <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02881.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                are
                <!-- Where is the "are"? Or did Harned add it in?  I can't find it, but the quality of these pages isn't great. -al -->
                over since your illness began or seemed to begin dearest friend&#8212;so slow &amp;
                <!-- Is there an ampersand here?  Again, I don't see it. -al --> stealthy in its
                approaches, so slow &amp; stealthy in its retreat&#8212;may the Spring that is
                coming (the birds have already caught sight of it, cold &amp; brown &amp; bare as
                the landscape still is) may it but come laden with healing strengthening refreshing
                influences&#8212;so that you begin to feel again the joyous freedom of health
                warbling once more a song of joy for Lilac time. True I know indeed my dearest that
                anyhow you are content, not grudging the price paid for your life work, but even
                some way or other the richer for paying it&#8212;garnering precious equivalents for
                pain &amp; privation of health in your inmost soul. I cannot choose but believe this
                earnestly&#8212;the resplendent faith that there is not "one cause nor result
                lamentable, at last, in the Universe" which <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02881.004.jpg" type="verso"/> glows throughout the Poems is for me an
                exhaustless source of strength &amp; comfort.&#8212;I see <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">every</supplied> now &amp; then
                &amp; like the more each time the Conways. I am half afraid Mr. Conway<!-- <ptr target="loc.02881_n2"/> --> works too incessantly&#8212;that is does not like well
                enough the indispensable supplement of close mental work&#8212;plenty of air &amp;
                    exercise&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">he</unclear>
                <!-- Harned had &#38;c. -al --> hates walking, &amp; indeed it is not to be wondered
                at in great smoky London (I shall be fond enough &amp; proud enough of it too when I
                am over the Atlantic). Unless one has a real passion for open air &amp; the sense of
                sky overhead, like me. I hear Mr. Conway is coming to America for six months in
                October. </p>

            <p><date when="1875-02-25">Feb. 25</date>&#8212;I kept my letter till today that I might
                have the happiness of <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">speaking</supplied>
                <!-- this is Harned's transcription, but I'm not sure I see it. -al --> to you on my
                birthday. See me this evening in the bright cheerful parlour of our cottage which
                stands just in the middle of the old village (it has <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02881.005.jpg" type="recto"/> been a village &amp; jogged on through
                all change at its own sober sleepy pace this 800 years) my mother in her arm chair
                by the fire, I chatting with her &amp; working or playing to her when she is awake,
                &amp; with the Poems I love beside me reading musing pondering
                <!-- Harned had "wondering"? -al --> while she dozes. Ah, shall I ever attain to the
                Ideal that burst upon me with such splendour of light &amp; joy in those Poems in
                1869&#8212;so filling, so possessing me I seemed as if I had by one bound attained
                to that ideal&#8212;as if I were already a very twin of the soul from whom they
                emanated. But now I know that divine foretaste indicated what was possible for me
                not what was accomplished&#8212;I know the slow growth&#8212;the standstill winters
                that follow <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02881.006.jpg" type="verso"/> the
                growing joyous springs &amp; ripening summers. I believe it will take more lives
                than this one to reach that mountain on which I was transfigured again, never to
                descend more, but to start thence for new <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">heights, fresh</unclear> glories. Ah, dear Friend, will you be able
                to have patience with me, for me? </p>
