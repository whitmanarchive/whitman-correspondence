                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I was glad to get your card &amp; to hear that your 
                health was improved. I thought surely we should see you 
                as you returned from Canada in Sept. I had made great reckoning
                of a long visit with you. We have all been well. I send you 
                a late picture of Julian, but it does not flatter 
                him. He talks everything
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="tex_ao.00007a_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                I showed him your picture in Scribner, &amp; asked him 
                who it was. "It is uncle Alt" he said. I think 
                that picture a good one, better than the photo from which 
                it was taken. Stedman was here in June &amp; I let 
                him have two or three pictures to choose from. He said 
                he had had a big fight with Holland, but had conquered, 
                Holland would have neither piece nor picture. I am 
                satisfied with the essay. It is better than I expected 
                It is my philosophy always 
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="tex_ao.00007b_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                to accept the good &amp; let the bad go to the dogs. The good 
                in the essay will help us; the bad no body will heed 
            It will bring you readers &amp; friends &amp; that is enough. The 
                article is candid &amp; respectful &amp; that is all we can ask. 
                This is a free country &amp; Stedman can think &amp; say what he 
                pleases, so long as he keeps within the bounds of legitimate 
                criticism. His argument is very weak in places, notably 
                on the procreation business. To 
                compare sex &amp; what goes with it, to mud &amp; slime that 
                nature covers up, is a fatal error. In fact it seems 
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="tex_ao.00006a_large.jpg" type="verso"/>         
                to me that the adverse criticisms in the paper are all 
                weak &amp; ineffectual, &amp; that he is truly at home only when 
                he is appreciative. How gingerly he does walk at times to be 
                sure, as if he feared the ground underfoot was mined. He 
                wrote a propitiatory letter to both me &amp; O'Connor, before 
                the article appeared. He evidently had a wholesome 
                dread of O'Connor's war whoop &amp; scalping knife. But 
                S. is a generous fellow, think how much better he is than 
                the set to which he belongs. 
             A young man from Cambridge Mass. (W.S. Kennedy) 
                writes me that he had a 
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="tex_ao.00008_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                furious talk with Stedman about the article, &amp; that he 
                himself has written a paper that will appear in the 
                <hi rend="underline">Californian</hi> soon, which he 
                thinks does you fuller justice. I do not know him, but he says he expects 
                to go to Phila. soon to work 
                on the <hi rend="underline">American</hi>, a news 
                paper started there. He says 
                his paper was accepted by the <hi rend="underline">International</hi>, &amp; then
                returned on account of Mr Lodge, one of the editors.
            Dr Bucke is a good fellow, but between me &amp; 
                you, I am a little shy of him; I fear he lacks 
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="tex_ao.00009_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                balance &amp; proportion &amp; that his book will not be 
                pitched in the right key. But I hope I do him 
                injustice. 
            </p>
            <p> It is a lovely day here &amp; I am in a mood to bet 
                that Garfield will carry every Northern State. When 
                this reaches you you will know whether I would have 
                lost or won. Write to me.
