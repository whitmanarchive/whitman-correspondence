            <p>I have just finished writing a letter to Mr<hi rend="underline">s</hi> Andrew Rome<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> 
                of Brooklyn &amp; one to a little Canadian cousin (at Smith's Falls Ontario)

                &amp; to tell you that I am thinking of you, 3,000 miles away.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02509.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I was pleased to learn from your kind p.c. to J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/>
                that things were at least no worse with you &amp; we keep on hoping that a change 
                for the better will come soon.<ptr target="loc.02509_n2"/></p> 
            <p>From your mentioning having received <hi rend="underline">two</hi> letters from me
                I presume the missing one<ptr target="loc.02509_n4"/> has reached you but as I find that I omitted enclosing the
                copy of it in my last I send it herewith tho' it is not worth much.</p>
            <p>I daresay Wallace will tell you that he has asked Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02509.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

                Rev. F.R.C. Hutton's<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> house where the Dr. will stay all night.</p>
            <p>The rest of the time he will stay with Wallace at Anderton, as arranged
                before he left for London.</p>
            <p>I send you a few copies of the Bolton rep<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="medium">rint</unclear>
                of the article in the <hi rend="underline">Camden Post</hi><ptr target="loc.02507_n5"/>—1 dozen for yourself,

            <p>I cannot tell you how deeply that report has affected us but we feel that

            <p>But we thank him from

                This is the Bolton operatives general holiday—all the factories, foundries 
                &amp; workshops being closed (producing a notable change in the town atmosphere)—&amp; 
                thousands of the working people leaving town for the seaside &amp; other holiday resorts</p>
            <p>This afternoon Wallace &amp; I have had our photographs taken at by a professional.
                You may see the result someday</p> 
            <p>As I write a great crowd of folks is tramping past. They are coming from seeing 
                Prof Baldwin<ptr target="loc.02509_n5"/> drop a mile from a baloon, with a parachute!</p>

            <p>Since writing the foregoing I have received your pc. of Aug 6<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02509_n3"/> for wh I thank
                you most cordially. Also a good long letter from H.L. Traubel—the dear good
                fellow that he is; God bless him!</p> 
            <p>It is good news to learn that you were then rather better—"some favourable 
                features (&amp; g't easements &amp; reliefs they are)"—&amp; that you 
                had been able to take "a fair breakfast."</p>
            <p>God grant that this improvement may continue &amp; advance!</p>

            <p>I expect Wallace in again tonight— he has gone to Dixon's<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> 
                to tea— &amp; will shew him your p.c &amp; Traubel's letter.</p>
            <p>I am glad you like the pictures of Dr Bucke, but I
                mean to have another <hi rend="underline">shot</hi> at him next week! 
                I do no<supplied reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="high">t</supplied> often get such a good subject. How I wish I had the opportunity 
                of "firing off" at <hi rend="underline">you</hi> again my dear good old friend!</p>
            <p>By the way I notice that Stead<ptr target="n4113"/>

                I now send you—&amp; a wretched thing he has made of it! 
                I am glad he has not put my name to it, as it does <hi rend="underline">no one</hi> 
                credit as it is tho' the original has <hi rend="underline">some</hi> resemblance 
                to you while this is about as bad as it could be.</p>
            <p>I also send you a copy of the group of Parish church choir boy friends taken at
