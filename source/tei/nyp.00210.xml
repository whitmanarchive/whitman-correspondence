            <p>Your letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome. I will leave out "orgies" since you dislike it so much. I have been much delayed in the printing&#8212;but I believe they have now fairly got to work, &amp; will go on expeditiously. I found a printer, Chapin,<ptr target="nyp.00210_n3"/> 24 Beekman st., who was getting new type of the kind I wanted, &amp; I waited for him&#8212;He engages to have the composition &amp; presswork done in from two to three weeks. It will be typographically about the same as Drum-Taps, only about five times as thick&#8212;Upon calling on Huntington &amp; Son,<ptr target="nyp.00210_n4"/> I found that Drum-Taps has sold somewhat better than I anticipated&#8212;I was treated very courteously, &amp; they promised to advertise D. T. &amp; push it this fall&#8212;I did not say any thing about the coming new Leaves&#8212;but may propose to Messrs. H. to be the agents before I return&#8212;I shall probably return about the 12th of September&#8212;</p>
            <p>When I arrived here, I found my mother &amp; the rest lately moved (again) in a large old house out in Brooklyn suburbs, &amp; in a good deal of confusion &amp;c.&#8212;Mother was not well, &amp; seemed generally fagged out&#8212;But since then things have come round somewhat&#8212;Mother has improved a good deal&#8212;yesterday felt quite like herself again&#8212;I spend three or four hours there every day&#8212;Jeff is very well, &amp; George pretty well&#8212;in the latter I can see that campaigning &amp; Danville prison have left their mark<ptr target="nyp.00210_n5"/>&#8212;I am stopping at Mrs. Price's, am most pleasantly situated in personal comforts, &amp;c.&#8212;Mrs. P. has asked much about you&#8212;hopes to see you yet&#8212;The weather here is really perfect&#8212;I have been to the Central Park, had a long ride &amp; foot ramble&#8212;the place is probably looking its best just now&#8212;I go out on Broadway occasionally &amp; take a walk, or a ride on the omnibus&#8212;I am received by the drivers with renewed rapture&#8212;it is more marked than ever.</p>
            <p>I havn't learned any thing worth mentioning about literary persons or doings here. I doubt whether the article will be accepted in the Galaxy<ptr target="nyp.00210_n6"/>&#8212;don't know who edits it&#8212;I send my love to John Burroughs<ptr target="nyp.00210_n7"/>&#8212;Also the same to Charles Eldridge<ptr target="nyp.00210_n8"/>&#8212;I hope to be able to write to Nelly<ptr target="nyp.00210_n9"/>&#8212;I wish you when you write to say I send my love to her. And now for a while, my dear friend, Farewell.</p>
