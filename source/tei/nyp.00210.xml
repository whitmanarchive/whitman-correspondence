            <p>Your letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome. I will leave out "orgies" since you dislike it so much. I have been much delayed in the printing—but I believe they have now fairly got to work, &amp; will go on expeditiously. I found a printer, Chapin,<ptr target="nyp.00210_n3"/> 24 Beekman st., who was getting new type of the kind I wanted, &amp; I waited for him—He engages to have the composition &amp; presswork done in from two to three weeks. It will be typographically about the same as Drum-Taps, only about five times as thick—Upon calling on Huntington &amp; Son,<ptr target="nyp.00210_n4"/> I found that Drum-Taps has sold somewhat better than I anticipated—I was treated very courteously, &amp; they promised to advertise D. T. &amp; push it this fall—I did not say any thing about the coming new Leaves—but may propose to Messrs. H. to be the agents before I return—I shall probably return about the 12th of September—</p>
            <p>When I arrived here, I found my mother &amp; the rest lately moved (again) in a large old house out in Brooklyn suburbs, &amp; in a good deal of confusion &amp;c.—Mother was not well, &amp; seemed generally fagged out—But since then things have come round somewhat—Mother has improved a good deal—yesterday felt quite like herself again—I spend three or four hours there every day—Jeff is very well, &amp; George pretty well—in the latter I can see that campaigning &amp; Danville prison have left their mark<ptr target="nyp.00210_n5"/>—I am stopping at Mrs. Price's, am most pleasantly situated in personal comforts, &amp;c.—Mrs. P. has asked much about you—hopes to see you yet—The weather here is really perfect—I have been to the Central Park, had a long ride &amp; foot ramble—the place is probably looking its best just now—I go out on Broadway occasionally &amp; take a walk, or a ride on the omnibus—I am received by the drivers with renewed rapture—it is more marked than ever.</p>
            <p>I havn't learned any thing worth mentioning about literary persons or doings here. I doubt whether the article will be accepted in the Galaxy<ptr target="nyp.00210_n6"/>—don't know who edits it—I send my love to John Burroughs<ptr target="nyp.00210_n7"/>—Also the same to Charles Eldridge<ptr target="nyp.00210_n8"/>—I hope to be able to write to Nelly<ptr target="nyp.00210_n9"/>—I wish you when you write to say I send my love to her. And now for a while, my dear friend, Farewell.</p>
