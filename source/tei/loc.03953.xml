                <salute>Dear Ed</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your good letter has just come &amp; all seems to be in such good spirits with you,
                &amp; every thing right so far—</p>

            <p>—When I wrote to your folks a few days ago, (after I heard you had started out) I said
                I could not tell of course whether your enterprise would be a <hi rend="underline">pecuniary success</hi> or not, but I was certain it would be in showing you a
                different world, and a deeper knowledge not only of general human nature but of
                yourself—(all of which the Scripture calls <hi rend="underline">that
                    wisdom</hi> which is more precious than worldly riches.) Every young man ought
                to explore something of the outside world,—especially of our American country
                &amp; the west<ptr target="loc.03953_n1"/>—</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00370_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>Nothing very new with me—I am well as usual for me—As I write I am up in
                my room Stevens Street—a pretty cold day, &amp; moderate snow &amp; ice on the
                ground, but sun shining bright—quite a good deal of sleighing—</p>

            <p>—I am busy with my writing in moderation—write four or five hours every
                day—My new book is doing reasonably well (better than I expected) &amp;
                promises to give me a small but steady income—</p>

            <p>—I have not been down, but shall go before long, &amp; then I will write to you
                again—</p>

            <p>—I got a letter from Ruth four days ago, &amp; saw Muller yesterday—all your
                folks were as usual—When I go down I shall make Van give me a good
                ride—I got a long letter from Herbert Gilchrist—he is
                well<ptr target="loc.03953_n2"/>—Carpenter ditto—Ed dear boy I won't give you any particular advice
                for I have an idea you know how to take care of yourself both morally &amp;
                physically—&amp; I hope you will prove it—</p>
