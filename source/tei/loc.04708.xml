            </opener>
            <p>When I got to the office this morning I found a note from D<hi rend="underline"
                    >r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> waiting me, enclosing your long letter of
                March 30<hi rend="underline">th</hi> &#38; 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi>.<ptr
                    target="loc.04708_n2"/> He called on me at noon, when I returned it, so that he
                might <choice>

                    <corr>show</corr>
                </choice> it to "the boys"<ptr target="loc.04708_n4"/> tonight.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell you how pleased we are to receive your letter,&#8212;both for its own
                sake &#38; the information it contains, &#38; because of the great loving-kindness
                it manifests.&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01164.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>We had come to love you long ago as the dearest of friends &#38; benefactors, but
                your inexhaustible kindness to us personally stirs our hearts to their lowest
                depths.&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tonight when I got home I found a parcel waiting <hi rend="underline">me</hi> too,
                with your dear &#38; familiar superscription. This I found to contain "<hi
                    rend="underline">Munyon's Magazine</hi>" for March &#38; "<hi rend="underline"
                    >Once a Week</hi>" for March 24<hi rend="underline">th</hi> Thanks to you, my
                dearest friend for all.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I was delighted to find the autograph copy of your poem "<hi rend="underline">The
                    Commonplace</hi>."<ptr target="loc.04708_n3"/> I have read it several times
                already, <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01165.jpg" type="recto"/> &#38; rejoice
                in it greatly. It accords with the spirit &#38; teaching of your books throughout,
                but this special statement &#38; lesson was also needed.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J <choice>
                    <sic>shewed</sic>
                    <corr>showed</corr>
                </choice> me at noon a complete copy (from shorthand report) of my address last
                Friday. As my talk was crude enough, &#38; I had only been able to give it very
                slight preparation indeed, it affected me to see how much my poor effort was valued.
                For it simply meant that, through me, they had a new presentment (which they could
                more readily apprehend) of certain aspects of <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                personality &#38; teaching. And it is touching to note how strongly these appeal <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01166.jpg" type="verso"/> to the depths of widely
                different people. Of the wide &#38; loving response you will yet meet with I am very
                sure.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow night I expect D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>. J. &#38; Greenhalgh<ptr
                target="loc.02465_n5"/> here, when I intend to read your lecture on Lincoln's
                    death,<ptr target="med.00797_n1"/> &#38; the "Burial Hymn."</p>
            <p>I am pleased &#38; touched by the "<hi rend="underline">Memories of Lincoln</hi>" in
                Munyon's Magazine, &#38; especially by the story of his visit to Findley Hospital.
                It is very beautiful, &#38; associates him in my mind with you too.</p>
            <p>Will you give my love to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38; to Warry<ptr

                <p>Instead of D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>. J. &#38; Greenhalgh coming here tonight
                    (as I had proposed, for health reasons) I stayed in Bolton. After tea
                    Greenhalgh, Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> &#38; I met at the D<hi

                        rend="underline">r</hi> J's assistant) I read aloud your Lecture on the
                    death of Lincoln &#38; the "Burial Hymn." Had I been sure of being able to
                    attend, we should have arranged accordingly, &#38; had a better attendance.</p>

                    read your lecture without over-exertion.</p>
                <p>The weather here has been rather better these last few days &#38; more
                    spring-like. I rejoice for <hi rend="underline">your</hi> sake in the
