                <salute>Dear Son Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Nothing very new with me&#8212;I continue about the same&#8212;my general strength the best 
                it has been yet&#8212;I go out a little most every day, but it is very cold weather here&#8212;I was quite <choice><abbr>non-plus'd</abbr><expan>nonplussed</expan></choice> at that affair in Bergazzi's with Frank Rives<ptr target="loc.01623_n1"/>&#8212;who is he? Is he some one I know? Was he drunk or loony? tell me more of it&#8212;what he said&#8212;the exact words&#8212;It seems unaccountable to me&#8212;from what I gather 
                from your letter you did exactly right. If I hadn't met with some queer characters myself&#8212;&amp; been the subject of such strange &amp; unaccountable remarks&#8212;I should hardly think any thing of the sort possible&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I have occupied myself lately writing&#8212;have sent a letter to the Graphic, describing the Capitol, 
                which they have accepted, and may publish Saturday or Monday.<ptr target="loc.01623_n2"/> Have also written a poem which I have sold<ptr target="loc.01623_n3"/>&#8212;will send you one when it appears.&#8212;As I write this holding the paper on my lap 
                I am sitting here in the parlor, by the heater&#8212;have had my dinner&#8212;drank quite a goblet of wine, 
                which I believe has flown into my head. (My brother west, &amp; another friend here, 
                have both sent me presents of good wine&#8212;&amp; I drink it occasionally, half water&#8212;but this time I have taken a little extra)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete, I thought I would send you a couple of shirts&#8212;so I have ordered them made here, 
                got as near <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01623.002.jpg" type="verso"/>the measure as I could&#8212;they will be done in some ten days, perhaps less, 
                &amp; then I will send them. I like mine so well, I have had yours made like them, with collars on. 
                I have had no new togs made this winter. I wear my old gray suit, &amp; the old black overcoat,&#8212;&amp; when very cold, or stormy my gray shawl&#8212;If you should see me now leaning against Milburn's 
                counter, you wouldn't <hi rend="underline">see any difference from last winter</hi>&#8212;(but my heart tells a different story)</p>
            
            <p>I have been in all day, &amp; must get out a little&#8212;the evenings are the most tedious 
                with me&#8212;I can manage to put in <hi rend="underline">the days</hi>, but these long <hi rend="underline">cold evenings</hi>, I think if 
                I only had the right quarters in Washington, <hi rend="underline">my own quarters &amp; a good wood fire, 
                &amp; you with me as</hi> often as possible, I should be comparatively happy</p>
