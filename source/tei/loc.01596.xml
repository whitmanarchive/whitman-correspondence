        <salute>Dear son,<ptr target="loc.01596_n2"/></salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I received yours of the 9th&#8212;and was right glad to hear from you, and to get such an
        affectionate letter. We have had gay times here this week, with what they call the
          "Carnival"<ptr target="n0140"/>&#8212;it continued two days &amp; nights. The nights were
        the best. Every thing was lit up, and it was like a scene of enchantment. The crowds of
        spectators were countless. Hundreds and even thousands mixed in, the second afternoon &amp;
        night in fancy dresses, or wore masks&#8212;&amp; went around having fun. Lots of women were
        out, some of them as full of sport as the men&#8212;The principal street here is very wide,
        I should think three times as wide as Broadway. This was the scene of operations. All the
        vehicles were turned off, then at certain hours let on again for a while, for driving &amp;
        races&#8212;there were some splendid horses&#8212;Less drinking than you would have
        supposed&#8212;No musses, &amp; no accidents. I send you a paper. Last night however was a
        murder, a man I knew well by sight, a gambler called "Sonny James"<ptr target="loc.01596_n3"
        /> was killed. </p>

      <p>With me all goes about the same. I work about 6 hours every day, mostly writing&#8212;am
        well &amp; hearty, travel around out doors quite a good deal&#8212;&amp; keep up a cheerful
          heart.<ptr target="loc.01596_n4"/> Johnny,<ptr target="loc.01596_n5"/> you say you should
        like to see me&#8212;Well, no more than I should to see you, my darling<ptr
          target="loc.01596_n6"/> boy. I wish we were together this minute, &amp; you had employment
        so we could remain with each other, if you would feel satisfied to be so.<ptr
          target="loc.01596_n7"/>
      </p>

      <p>Have<ptr target="loc.01596_n8"/> you got work of any kind there in Brooklyn? Write to me,
          Jack,<ptr target="loc.01596_n9"/> &amp; let me know all particulars.<ptr
          target="loc.01596_n10"/> Love to you, dear son,<ptr target="loc.01596_n11"/> &amp; good
        bye for this time. </p>
