                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Accept of my best thanks for your kind letter with the enclosed slips of your article
                on "Old Poets," which I received on the 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst. the
                article is one of great interest to me intrinsically; and extrinsically because of
                the rigorous mentality it evidences.</p>

            <p>By the same mail I received a letter form John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> in
                which he says that he "spent two or three days in Camden, the latter<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02449.002.jpg" type="verso"/> part of Sept<hi
                    rend="underline">r</hi>" and found you "in pretty good condition" the best for
                three years he thinks&#8212;which is good news for all your friends here. He also
                says that he has sent your photo (from my negative) "back to England, to a daughter
                of Charles Kingsley's,<ptr target="n0137"/> who wanted one &amp; who is a reader and
                admirer of Whitman."</p>



            <p>By the way I have not heard whether the negative reached you safely or not. If so I
                hope it may be of use to you.</p>
            <p>I will send J. B. another photo of you. He considers it a most excellent one. He has
                an article with<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02449.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <hi rend="underline">North American Review</hi> for Oct. on "faith and credulity"
                but I have not read it yet.</p>
            <p>Ingersoll<ptr target="n0839"/> had an article in the Sept number on "Tolstoi and the
                    <hi rend="underline">Kreutzer Sonata</hi>".</p>
            <p>I received a letter form Captain Nowell (from <unclear reason="illegible"
                    cert="medium" resp="#ktl">Guccustown</unclear>) respecting our commission &amp;
                his visit to you.</p>
            <p>I conveyed your loving salutation &amp; benediction to J W Wallace<ptr target="n6121"
                /> and in a letter to me in which he tells me of certain worries &amp; troubles he
                says that it is "like a message of comfort from the skies" to him, &amp; he
                continues&#8212;"God bless <hi rend="underline">him</hi>! Say I &amp; my grateful
                love accompany him always!"&#8212;I saw him this morning. He is looking pretty well
                and sends his love to you, as do all the friends whom I have met since receiving
                    y<hi rend="underline">r</hi> letter.<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02449.004.jpg" type="verso"/> At our last meeting (at the house of
                Wentworth Dixon) I read "The Carpenter"&#8212;at least the most of it&#8212;which
                took me nearly two hours, and much did they all enjoy that splendid story and the
                charming glimpses it gives of your personality &amp; influence&#8212;some of them
                being "fetched" by parts of it; and no wonder, for it is a most moving story and
                powerfully told. At next meeting (Nov<hi rend="underline">r</hi> 17<hi
                    rend="underline">th</hi>) I shall read your letter &amp; your article to
                them.</p>
            <p>We have had some typical English November weather here lately&#8212;a good deal of
                rain and fog&#8212;but this has been a truly delightful day of gladsome, benignant
                sunshine&#8212;a welcome "halcyon days" before the winter settles upon us.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02449.005.jpg" type="recto"/> I have just returned
                from the Bolton Chrysanthemum Show in our Town Hall where I have spent a very
                pleasant hour promenading, listening to the strains of our grand organ &amp; looking
                at the really fine display of gorgeously tinted bloom&#8212;quite a pleasant break
                in my professional work.</p>
            <p>I hope you are keeping better &amp; have quite got rid of the cough I have no
                cough&#8212;&amp; I have had none Warry told me of in his letter.</p>
