                    Dear Walt,
                </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
                Thank you for the two papers received today&#8212;containing many items of interest, the Herbert Spencer interviews included. 
                And thank you still more for the kind, constant thought which prompts you to send them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another day of midsummer warmth &amp; beauty&#8212;It seems a land of perpetual summer, &amp; I begin to fear that when I get 
                back to England&#8212;especially during our November fogs&#8212;I shall be dissatisfied &amp; look back on my Canadian 
                experiences with envy.
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00954_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>
                I think, however, that my main feeling will be gratitude that my trip was so fortunate in all its circumstances. And, indeed, 
                I am deeply thankful that I am so blessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This morning I went with Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> through the North Bldg. (Refractory Wards.) Patients as a rule more or 
                less happy (not many melancholic) &amp; well looked after. But what thoughts, feelings, &amp; problems they rouse!&#8212;I asked 
                Dr. Beemer about <hi rend="underline">your</hi> visits, &amp; though I did not learn much, what he did tell me was characteristic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent the rest of the morning in looking over the papers
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00955_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                you sent, &amp; in copying some of the letters to Pete Doyle<ptr target="n0752"/> that the doctor has. These have quite a fascination 
                to me, in the side lights they throw on your most kind &amp; loving soul. God bless you &amp; our love to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After dinner I went to the Fair along with the children &amp; Mrs. Beemer's sister. Many thousands of people there&#8212;from the 
                entire province I think.&#8212;The general <hi rend="underline">average</hi> very good&#8212;fine looking people as a whole, 
                well-behaved, &amp; comfortably prosperous&#8212;English looking&#8212;but with a difference hard to define.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since tea I have been across to office for a letter from our loyal &amp; indefatigable friend Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/> 
                Lovely glowing western sky. 
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00956_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>
                I hope that this long spell of beautiful weather will prove beneficial to you (as indeed it <hi rend="underline">must</hi> do) &amp; 
                I am heartily relieved &amp; glad that the reports so far have been so favourable. Health, &amp; immunity from pain to you, &amp; 
                serenest joys. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please give my love to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; Warry.<ptr target="loc.00668_n4"/> With best love to you always
            </p>
