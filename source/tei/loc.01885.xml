                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>It was a great pleasure to me to see your handwriting (letter of 19
                Oct.)&#8212;likewise to make the acquaintance of <name type="person">Mr.
                    Marvin</name><!-- <ptr target="n0385"/> -->, whom we all found most pleasant and
                sensible. The only disappointment was his short sojourn over here: for, as soon as
                he had called on us with your letter (<choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> was about 1 Dec., I think) he went over to Paris &amp; then, after
                returning &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01885.002.jpg" type="verso"/>dining
                with us, another day or two saw him on his way homeward acroſs the Atlantic. I
                dare say he has told you (if opportunity served) something about the evening he
                paſsed with us &amp; a few friends&#8212;<hi rend="underline">good
                    Whitmanites</hi> most of them. Let me see whether I can remember the names. Mr.
                Marvin took down to dinner our dear &amp; admirable friend <name type="person">Mrs.
                    Gilchrist</name><!-- <ptr target="n0259"/> --> (who lately lost her mother, aged more
                than 90, &amp; expects to see her eldest son happily married pretty soon): I found
                Mr. M. was not aware (&amp; perhaps you are not) that Mrs. G. is the widow of a
                literary man of some name, Alex. Gilchrist<!-- <ptr target="n0258"/> -->, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01885.003.jpg" type="recto"/>author of the Life of

                of the athenaeum, &amp;: a man of excellent critical capacity, who knows your value.
                Then Miſs <name type="person">Mathilde Blind</name>, stepdaughter of the German
                revolutionist of 1848, a woman of singular ability &amp; independence of mind, &amp;
                a most earnest believer in the author of Leaves of Graſs. Next, <name type="person">Justin McCarthy</name>Justin McCarthy, one of the foremost writers
                in the Daily News, &amp; a novelist of much talent: he has been more than once in
                America&#8212;also his wife. Then my father–in–law <choice>

                Lastly E. W. Goſse &amp; his bride <!--annotation-->: the former a poet of
                these more recent years, who has done some graceful things, &amp; has much knowledge
                &amp; good perception as a critic: Mrs. Goſse <hi rend="underline">was</hi> lately Miſs Ellen Epps <!--annotation-->,

                <!--annotation-->, a dutchman now naturalized in England.&#8212;But perhaps I am
                peppering my letter with a lot of details that are not much to your purpose. Mr.

                shabby) copy of the selections, &amp; he will present it to the Library.</p>

            <p>My father–in–law has, I know, ordered the publishers (Tinsley Brothers)
                to send you a copy of the Literary Remains of his son<!-- <ptr target="n0454"/> -->, just
                published: the youthful author died rather more than a year ago. I think the book
                will present to you evidences of uncommon faculty. You will see on the
