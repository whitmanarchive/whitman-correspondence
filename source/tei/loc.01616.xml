            <p>I wonder if you have quite forgotten me. I know the first thing you will very
                naturally do will be to look to the end of this letter <choice>

                remember that some months ago (in the Early part of December I think it was for I
                know Washington was busy with preparations for the reopening of Congress). I came to

                we had a long walk &amp; talk together. I then <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01616.002.jpg" type="verso"/> promised that I would write to you when
                I reached England perhaps you have thought me forgetful. I hope not for indeed I
                think of you very very often &amp; though sometimes one feels as if there were a
                huge gulf between this and America at others again the thousands of miles of
                sounding sea seems but as a very little space &amp; I must say that since I have
                crossed this ferry&#8212;shaken hands upon the other side the distance seems as
                nothing &amp; the desire to return once more gets stronger every day&#8212;I have
                been very, very much occupied &amp; intensely busy one way &amp; another arrears of
                work claimed my attention for you know I am not a "briefless barrister" &amp;
                latterly my work has increased but I have determined that this <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01616.003.jpg" type="recto"/> glorious spring time shall not pass

            <p>I think that most countries are perhaps most beautiful in spring time certainly
                England is to my mind&#8212;you know the whole country looks like one lovely garden
                bursting forth into new life. Every shade of green&#8212; the
                grass<!-- Kevin saw "glow" --> like Emeralds, &amp; the perfect effects of light
                &amp; shadow &amp; really what with the songs of birds, the smell of the flowers the
                clouds the rainbows &amp; sunlights as I see them &amp; hear them all over this my

                make it so. I long for you very often to see all this country. It is so different
                &amp; yet so like to yours. Differences, I think very great yet almost
                indistinguishable, certainly for the most part differences which <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01616.006.jpg" type="verso"/> can be better felt
