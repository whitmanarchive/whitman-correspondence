            <p>I wonder if you have quite forgotten me I know the first thing you will very naturally do 
                will be to look to the end of this letter <choice><orig>endeavour</orig><reg>endeavor</reg></choice> 
                to decipher the signature, &#38; then maybe get to thinking of when &#38; where &#38; how 
                it comes to pass that you hear from one&#8212;you will then I hope remember that some months 
                ago (in the Early part of December I think it was for I know Washington was busy with preparations 
                for the reopening of Congress) I came to see you in <choice><abbr>yr:</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice>
                office at the Treasury&#8212;And we 
                had a long walk &#38; talk together. I then 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01616.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                
                promised that I would write to you when I reached England perhaps you have thought me forgetful 
                I hope not for indeed I think of you very very often &#38; though sometimes one feels as if 
                there were a huge gulf between this and America at others again the thousands of miles of sounding 
                sea seems but as a very little space, &#38; I must say that since I have crossed this ferry &#38; 
                shaken hands upon the other side the distance seems as nothing &#38; the desire to return once 
                more gets stronger every day&#8212;I have been very, very much occupied &#38; intensely busy one 
                way &#38; another arrears of work claimed my attention for you know I am not a "briefless barrister" 
                &#38; latterly my work has increased but I have determined that this 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01616.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                glorious spring time shall not pass without my carrying out <choice><sic>the my</sic><corr>my</corr></choice> 
                intention of scribbling to you.</p>
            
            <p>I think that most countries are perhaps most beautiful in spring time certainly England is to my 
                mind&#8212;you know the whole country looks like one lovely garden bursting forth into new life 
                Every shade of green&#8212;the grass like Emeralds &#38; the most perfect effects of light &#38; shadow, 
                &#38; really what with the songs of birds, the smell of the flowers, the clouds the 
                rainbows &#38; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#cn" cert="medium">sun</unclear>lights as I see them &#38; 
                hear them all from this my room one can almost for the time forget care 
                &#38; sorrow &#38; believe that after all <hi rend="underline">this</hi> is Paradise&#8212;&#38; so 
                it is if one will only make it so. I long for you very often to see all this country It is so different
                &#38; yet so like to yours. Differences I think very great yet almost indistinguishable, certainly for 
                the most part differences which 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01616.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                
                can be better felt than <choice><orig>exprest</orig><reg>expressed</reg></choice>. When are you 
                coming&#8212;What month&#8212;what week in what steamer. I know you will go to Brooklyn &#38; then 
                for <choice><orig>Xing</orig><reg>crossing</reg></choice> in the Ferry boat among the crowd of people 
                &#38; I hear the bells jangling &#38; I see the great <choice><orig>Comander's</orig><reg>Commander's</reg></choice> 
                coming from us to you &#38; going from you to us, &#38; then you will meet 
                <choice><abbr>yr:</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> mother<ptr target="n0705"/>
                &#38; spend with her a few days. &#38; then will you next cross again to the great New York and walk straight to the office 
                take ticket, &#38; spend 9 days of <choice><abbr>yr</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> 
                holiday upon the great Atlantic&#8212;land at <choice><abbr>L'pool</abbr><expan>Liverpool</expan></choice> 
                and come on to me. Remember you promised that you would do so and I have been counting and relying upon 
                <choice><abbr>yr:</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> promise and am very very anxious to show you all
                I can &#38; to see you again.</p>
            
            <p>I must tell you that I gave Alfred Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> <choice><abbr>yr</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> books.
           
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01616.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
            he was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of <choice><abbr>yr</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> 
                deep regard for him &#38; that you were 
                coming over here this year which seemed to please him, and I can promise you from him too a hearty welcome. 
                Indeed until you come, you can hardly I think understand how many friends you have. I do not know that 
                I have very much news to tell you, for really <choice><abbr>yr:</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice>
                papers contain all. I seemed to know more of what was 
                going on here when I was over there, than I do now somehow</p>
            
            <p>Lowe our Chancellor of Exchequer has just taken a leaf out of the transatlantic page &#38; taxed matches.<ptr target="n0390"/> 
                I think if I remember the tax has been a very bad one with you, &#38; led to many evil results. here there 
                is a general dislike to it</p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01616.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>Swinburne<ptr target="n0610"/> goes on writing a good deal he has been ill very ill. It is fearful to see his 
                life utterly wretched &#38; unmanly I think it seems that his craving for drink is quite incurable&#8212;Now 
                I am not going to write any more just at present, but will write again soon &#38; hope that perhaps before very 
                long I may hear from you&#8212;&#38; that you are well.</p>
            
            <p>Any news you may have all you say, &#38; anything you think will be very welcome &#38; intensely 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01616.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                interesting to me, but if you tell me that you have finally reached 
                to come over to us directly this will be the most pleasing of all&#8212;This will delight me&#8212;I send you 
                a little book written by a friend of mine printed only for private circulation, it is rather prettily done I 
                think, not perhaps very original &#38; wanting in power, but still there is something engaging about it&#8212;He
