               </salute>

            <p>I wish you were here if only to enjoy the bright &amp; beautiful weather we are having here now for about two weeks&#8212;then it is sufficiently cool, &amp; the air buoyant &amp; inspiriting&#8212;dear friend, how long it is since we have seen each other, since those pleasant meetings &amp; those hot spiced rums &amp; suppers &amp; our dear friends Gray &amp; Chauncey, &amp; Russell, &amp; Fritschy too, (who for a while at first used to sit so silent,) &amp; Perkins &amp; our friend Raymond&#8212;how long it seems&#8212;how much I enjoyed it all. What a difference it is with me here&#8212;I tell you, Nat, my evenings are frequently spent in scenes that make a terrible difference&#8212;for I am still a hospital visitor, there has not passed a day for months (or at least not more than two) that I have not been among the sick &amp; wounded, either in hospitals or down in camp&#8212;occasionally here I spend the evenings in hospital&#8212;the experience is a profound one, beyond all else, &amp; touches me personally, egotistically, in unprecedented ways&#8212;I mean the way often the amputated, sick, sometimes dying soldiers cling &amp; cleave to me as it were as a man overboard to a plank, &amp; the perfect content they have if I will remain with them, sit on the side of the cot awhile, some youngsters often, &amp; caress them &amp;c.&#8212;It is delicious to be the object of so much love &amp; reliance, &amp; to do them such good, soothe &amp; pacify torments of wounds &amp;c&#8212;You will doubtless see in what I have said the reason I continue so long in this kind of life&#8212;as I am entirely on my own hook too.</p>
            <p>Life goes however quite well with me here&#8212;I work a few hours a day at copying &amp;c, occasionally write a newspaper letter, &amp; make enough money to pay my expenses&#8212;I have a little room, &amp; live a sort of German or Parisian student life&#8212;always get my breakfast in my room, (have a little spirit lamp) &amp; rub on free &amp; happy enough, untrammeled by business, for I make what little employment I have suit my moods&#8212;walk quite a good deal, &amp; in this weather the rich &amp; splendid environs of Washington are an unfailing fountain to me&#8212;go down the river, or off into Virginia once in a while&#8212;All around us here are forts, by the score&#8212;great ambulance &amp; teamsters' camps &amp;c&#8212;these I go to&#8212;some have little hospitals, I visit, &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear Nat, your good &amp; friendly letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome&#8212;I had not thought you had forgotten me, but I wondered why you did not write&#8212;What comfort you must take out there in the country, by the river&#8212;I have read your letter many times, as I do from all my dear friends &amp; boys there in New York&#8212;Perkins lately wrote me a first-rate letter, &amp; I will reply to it soon&#8212;I wish to see you all very much&#8212;I wish you to give my love to Fritschy, &amp; Fred Gray&#8212;I desire both to write to me&#8212;Nat, you also, my dear comrade, &amp; tell me all about the boys &amp; everything, all the little items are so good&#8212;should Charles Russell visit New York, I wish you to say to him I send him my love&#8212;I wish you the same to Perk, &amp; to Kingsley<ptr target="uro.00001_n2"/> &amp; Ben Knower&#8212;So good bye, my comrade, till we meet, &amp; God bless you, dear friend&#8212;</p>
