                <salute>My Dear Whitman&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I return the J. Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> Book. &#38; the
                pamphlet with thanks. The Burroughs book fed me on my journey home, so that I had
                to buy no other reading.</p>
            <p>I shall cherish the memory of that blessed January 2nd '85 to the end of my
                days.</p>
            <p>My dear Whitman, I want you to regard me as a sort of son; tell me whenever I can do
                anything for you; let me loan you 5.00 if you get in a pinch, (&#38; I have
                it). It is not always easy to borrow on real estate you know, or convenient I mean.
                &#38; behave handsomely, &#38; intimately &#38; affectionately toward me.</p>
            <p>I am going to enclose a $1.00 between fly-leaves of the Burroughs' book as half pay
                for a copy of the new edition of <choice><abbr>yr</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> poems when it comes out. If it <choice><abbr>shd</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> never come
                out, all right. I owe you $10. more anyway; for I <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.02599.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> got you to make me a present
                of yr books under false pretenses. I have not lectured on you more than once, &#38; shall 
		feel that I am a fraud until I have sent you $10. Say not a word.</p>
            <p>I know you are rich: all poets are. But I want you to have luxuries, now you are
                getting old.</p>

                pension on you&#8212;an honorary life salary&#8212;as a recognition of your

            <p>I found brave little wife well, &#38; got a hearty welcome. Our pretty &#38;
                remarkably smart cat died the day I returned&#8212;whereat tears &#38; swelling
                breasts, &#38; a private funeral.</p>
            <p>I must send you my N. Orleans articles. My Creole article in <unclear
