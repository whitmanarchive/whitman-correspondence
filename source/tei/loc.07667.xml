            <p>Well here I am, feeling fairly, commencing my 71st year. The dinner last evening came
                off &amp; went off, all right, &amp; was a great success<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/>—they say they had a mighty good
                <hi rend="underline">dinner</hi> (nothing to drink but Appollinaris water)—I was not at the eating part, but
                went an hour later—Ed<ptr target="n4319"/> wheel'd me in the chair,<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/> &amp; two policemen &amp; two other good
                fellows just carried me from the sidewalk, chair &amp; all as I sat, up the stairs &amp;
                turning (which were fortunately wide &amp; easy) to the big banquet hall &amp; big crowd,
                where I was roll'd to my seat, &amp; after being rec'd with tremendous cheering they
                bro't me a bottle of first rate champagne &amp; a big glass with ice, (Tom Harned<ptr target="n4146"/> sent
                to his house for the wine)—The whole thing was tip top &amp; luckily I felt better &amp;
                more something like myself, and nearer chipper, than for a year—I made a short
                talk, wh' you will see in the paper I enclose<ptr target="loc.07667_n2"/>—also Herbert's<ptr target="n0262"/> speech—It was
                largely a home &amp; neighbors' affair (wh' I liked) although there were (&amp; speeches
                from) outsiders—The compliments &amp; eulogies to me were <hi rend="underline">excessive</hi> &amp; without
                break<ptr target="loc.03027_n3"/>—But I fill'd my ice-glass with the good wine, &amp; pick'd out two fragrant roses
                f'm a big basket near me, &amp; kept cool &amp; jolly &amp; enjoy'd all—<ptr target="loc.07667_n3"/></p>
            <p>I suppose you have the pocket-book copy L of G<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> wh' I mailed yesterday—have just sold
                one &amp; got the 5 for it—Hamlin Garland<ptr target="loc.02128_n1"/> has been to see me to-day—also Tom
                Harned—The Phila: papers have long reports—a little rainy &amp; broken to-day, but
                pleasant—</p>
