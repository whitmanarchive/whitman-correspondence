            <p>Well here I am, feeling fairly, commencing my 71st year. The dinner last evening came
                off &#38; went off, all right, &#38; was a great success<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/>&#8212;they say they had a mighty good
                <hi rend="underline">dinner</hi> (nothing to drink but Appollinaris water)&#8212;I was not at the eating part, but
                went an hour later&#8212;Ed<ptr target="n4319"/> wheel'd me in the chair,<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/> &#38; two policemen &#38; two other good
                fellows just carried me from the sidewalk, chair &#38; all as I sat, up the stairs &#38;
                turning (which were fortunately wide &#38; easy) to the big banquet hall &#38; big crowd,
                where I was roll'd to my seat, &#38; after being rec'd with tremendous cheering they
                bro't me a bottle of first rate champagne &#38; a big glass with ice, (Tom Harned<ptr target="n4146"/> sent
                to his house for the wine)&#8212;The whole thing was tip top &#38; luckily I felt better &#38;
                more something like myself, and nearer chipper, than for a year&#8212;I made a short
                talk, wh' you will see in the paper I enclose<ptr target="loc.07667_n2"/>&#8212;also Herbert's<ptr target="n0262"/> speech&#8212;It was
                largely a home &#38; neighbors' affair (wh' I liked) although there were (&#38; speeches
                from) outsiders&#8212;The compliments &#38; eulogies to me were <hi rend="underline">excessive</hi> &#38; without
                break<ptr target="loc.03027_n3"/>&#8212;But I fill'd my ice-glass with the good wine, &#38; pick'd out two fragrant roses
                f'm a big basket near me, &#38; kept cool &#38; jolly &#38; enjoy'd all&#8212;<ptr target="loc.07667_n3"/></p>
            <p>I suppose you have the pocket-book copy L of G<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> wh' I mailed yesterday&#8212;have just sold
                one &#38; got the 5 for it&#8212;Hamlin Garland<ptr target="loc.02128_n1"/> has been to see me to-day&#8212;also Tom
                Harned&#8212;The Phila: papers have long reports&#8212;a little rainy &#38; broken to-day, but
                pleasant&#8212;</p>
