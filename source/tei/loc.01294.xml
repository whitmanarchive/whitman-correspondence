                <p>
                    <handShift rend="printed"/>The last I have heard of GARIBALDI'S movements was
                    that he was at the villa of his friend, the Marquis DE PALLAVICINI,<ptr
                        target="loc.01294_n2"/> in the neighborhood of Milan. This was on the 16th, the day
                    on which it was so confidently announced by his partisans in Florence that he
                    had crossed the Papal frontier. In the last number of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Figaro</hi>, I find the following "physiology" of this remarkable man, by
                    M. VILLEMOT,<ptr target="loc.01294_n3"/> which, though bordering on the caricature, is
                    so correct in many points that I think it will interest as well as amuse your
                    readers:</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>"'Liberator' or 'heroical bungler' GARIBALDI is a
                    figure. Had I any disposition to believe in the supernatural he would have
                    converted me. Against all reason and human wisdom, and to the profound
                    humiliation of vulgar calculations, he has accomplished things which are to be
                    classed among miracles and legends. He is not a great captain; as a tactician he
                    is no better than JEANNE D'ARC,<ptr target="loc.01294_n4"/> but like her he has a
                    familiar demon; he hears voices and takes the field. When he captures a throne
                    he seats himself upon it, eats a bunch of grapes and inquires after his goats.
                    He has not got a <sic>sou</sic>, and if he is a Chevalier of St. Maurice and
                    Lazare, he is profoundly ignorant of the fact.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Educated people say: 'You now see that he is nothing
                    but a rowdy; he may have a palace, receive diplomatic corps, and eat carp <hi
                        rend="italic">a la chambord</hi>, but he loves best to live on a crust of
                    bread rubbed with garlic.' But GARIBALDI likes to be judged from the point of
                    view of his temperament, and on this side of the Alps he cannot be very well
                    understood. He is reproached with not dressing himself like M. ROUHER,<ptr target="loc.01294_n5"/> and with
                    wearing a boatman's shirt, a slouched hat and a Scotch plaid. They accuse him,
                    moreover, of those turgidities of style which wound ears accustomed to the small
                    flute of the Academies. They forget that he is operating in the land of TASSO<ptr target="loc.02126_n4"/>
                    and ARIOSTO,<ptr target="loc.02126_n7"/> and if our genius induces us to the search after symplicity that of
                    Italy accommodates itself to a lyricism which with us is not in fashion except
                    in the minor drama.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>GARIBALDI is the expression of the land and the age
                    that gave him birth. You cannot get him to attire himself; you cannot get him to
                    express himself otherwise than is in <choice>
                        <sic>hts</sic>
                        <corr>his</corr>
                    </choice> nature. In his general physiognomy there is a mixture of the prophet
                    and the child. Of our civilization, of our manners, of our vices and our crosses
                    he knows nothing. He marches ahead without seeing. He lives in an ideal <choice>
                        <sic>worlp</sic>
                        <corr>world</corr>
                    </choice>, and knows no more of the men of his time than a contemporary hero of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> rising from his dust.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>His innocence exceeds all belief. The following is an
                    example of it. A few years ago he said to a friend, 'You are aware that I gave
                    notes to M. ALEXANDER DUMAS<ptr target="loc.03050_n2"/> to write my memoirs from. Would you believe that he
                    has added to them a number of things of his own invention?'</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>BRAVE GARIBALDI! Write not your memoirs and get no one
                    to write them. Let the people whom you have <choice>
                        <sic>fanatacised</sic>

                    </choice> compose your legend, and you will take your place among the great
