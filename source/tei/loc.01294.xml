                <p>The last I have heard of GARIBALDI'S movements was that he was at the villa of
                    his friend, the Marquis DE PALLAVICINI, in the neighborhood of Milan. This was
                    on the 16th, the day on which it was so confidently announced by his partisans
                    in Florence that he had crossed the Papal frontier. In the last number of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>, I find the following "physiology" of this
                    remarkable man, by M. VILLEMOT, which, though bordering on the caricature, is so
                    correct in many points that I think it will interest as well as amuse your
                    readers:</p>

                <p>"'Liberator' or 'heroical bungler' GARIBALDI is a figure. Had I any disposition
                    to believe in the supernatural he would have converted me. Against all reason
                    and human wisdom, and to the profound humiliation of vulgar calculations, he has
                    accomplished things which are to be classed among miracles and legends. He is
                    not a great captain; as a tactician he is no better than JEANNE D'ARC, but like
                    her he has a familiar demon; he hears voices and takes the field. When he
                    captures a throne he seats himself upon it, eats a bunch of grapes and inquires
                    after his goats. He has not got a sou<!-- sic -->, and if he is a Chevalier of
                    St. Maurice and Lazare, he is profoundly ignorant of the fact.</p>

                <p>Educated people say: 'You now see that he is nothing but a rowdy; he may have a
                    palace, receive diplomatic corps, and eat carp <hi rend="italic">a la
                        chambord</hi>, but he loves best to live on a crust of bread rubbed with
                    garlic.' But GARIBALDI likes to be judged from the point of view of his
                    temperament, and on this side of the Alps he cannot be very well understood. He
                    is reproached with not dressing himself like M. ROUHER, and with wearing a
                    boatman's shirt, a slouched hat and a Scotch plaid. They accuse him, moreover,
                    of those turgidities of style which wound ears accustomed to the small flute of
                    the Academies. They forget that he is operating in the land of TASSO and
                    ARIOSTO, and if our genius induces us to the search after symplicity that of
                    Italy accommodates itself to a lyricism which with us is not in fashion except
                    in the minor drama.</p>

                <p>GARIBALDI is the expression of the land and the age that gave him birth. You
                    cannot get him to attire himself; you cannot get him to express himself
                    otherwise than is in <choice>
                        <sic>hts</sic>
                        <corr>his</corr>
                    </choice> nature. In his general physiognomy there is a mixture of the prophet
                    and the child. Of our civilization, of our manners, of our vices and our crosses
                    he knows nothing. He marches ahead without seeing. He lives in an ideal <choice>
                        <sic>worlp</sic>
                        <corr>world</corr>
                    </choice>, and knows no more of the men of his time than a contemporary hero of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Illiad</hi> rising from his dust.</p>

                <p>His innocence exceeds all belief. The following is an example of it. A few years
                    ago he said to a friend, 'You are aware that I gave notes to M. ALEXANDER DUMAS
                    to write my memoirs from. Would you believe that he has added to them a number
                    of things of his own invention?'</p>

                <p>BRAVE GARIBALDI! Write not your memoirs and get no one to write them. Let the
                    people whom you have <choice>
                        <orig>fantacised</orig>
                        <reg>fantasized</reg>
                    </choice> compose your legend, and you will take your place among the great
                    Sphinxes of history."</p>
