                in my room 535
                15th st, as I am not able to get out at present&#8212;but the doctor gives me good
                hopes of being out and at my work in a few days&#8212;He says it is nothing but what
                I shall recover from in a few days&#8212;Mother, you must not feel uneasy&#8212;
                though I know you will&#8212;but I thought I

                expect to have any need)&#8212; </p>
