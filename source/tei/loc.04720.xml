                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was very pleased and proud yesterday morning to receive the stitched copy of "Good
                Bye"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> you sent me, &#38; the enclosed profile photo.</p>
            <p>Of course I have seen Johnston's<ptr target="n4102"/> copy of "Good Bye," but I only
                had it for one evening's hasty reading. So that I am very glad to have a copy that I
                can read at leisure &#38; absorb fully.<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01234_large.jpg" type="verso"/> And I am very proud to receive it
                from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, my dearest friend &#38; benefactor.</p>
            <p>The profile photo. pleases me immensely. It's strong contrasts of black &#38; white
                (no half tones) &#38; the peculiar disposition of the lights are very striking,
                &#38; give it a strange effect&#8212;as of a half materialized <hi rend="underline"
                    >spirit</hi> (one of Ossian's ghosts&#8212;or some antique prophet) grand &#38;
                pensive, brooding over unfathomable mysteries, sad &#38; tender.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01235_large.jpg" type="recto"/> The majestic dome
                of the head is better shewn than in any other portrait I have, &#38; the noble
                strength &#38; tenderness of the expression are very fine. I shall treasure it while
                I live as a precious addition to my other portraits of you.</p>
            <p>Johnston sent me copies of your P.C. of June 6<hi rend="underline">th</hi> &#38; your
                letter of June 9<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04720_n3"/> (recd
                today) I am glad to learn from the latter that you were "more free from excessive
                lassitude." But I fear the results of the extreme heat reported from the States.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01236_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I was very glad
                to read Traubel's<ptr target="n4267"/> good &#38; interesting letter.</p>
            <p>I haven't seen Johnston for over a week!&#8212;the first time such a thing has
                happened since he returned from America. (I usually see him several times in a
                week.) But I have been very busy, &#38; out of town a good deal, &#38; when he has
                called on me I have been out.</p>
            <p>I will send the sketches from Rivington by book post this mail.<ptr
