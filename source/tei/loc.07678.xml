                <p>You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
                    service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
                    very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees in prospect I
                    was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion&#8212;same that I held
                    before.&#8212;I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when
                    I have paid my debts and saved a little money.&#8212;I am now a citizen of
                    California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down
                    in the East, again, I think.&#8212;</p>
                <p>The death of William O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> though long anticipated, was a
                    great shock when the news came&#8212;What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
                    power was there extinguished, if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of us
                    can go out like a child's carlacue in the night.<ptr target="loc.02028_n1"/> I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of
                    Jordan, &amp; if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington<pb
                        xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02028.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I shall be
                    content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
                    Thank God&#8212;I have not seen her for two years, and more.</p>
                <p>I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia &amp; Camden papers the account of your
                    Seventieth Birthday dinner.<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/> I was especially touched by John Burroughs letter.&#8212;I am indebted to you for many papers&#8212;Always
                    glad to get them.&#8212;Address me until further notice simply Internal Revenue Agent. San Francisco. Cal. I hope you
                    are fairly comfortable.&#8212;God bless you my old and long tried friend&#8212;"With
                    fond affection and recollection.</p>
