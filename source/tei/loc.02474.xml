            <p>Your kind post card of April 20<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02474_n2"/> arrived here during my absence 
                in Scotland &amp; I thank you for your kindness in sending it. From it I was glad to learn that you had
                been out-of-doors again, &amp; I hope that by this time you are beginning to feel
                better &amp; stronger. It has been a hard pull for you, "no one knows how hard," as
                you said to Warry.<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> Bravely <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02474.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> indeed have you borne yourself during the struggle &amp; H.L.T.<ptr target="n3041"/>
                tells us that you do not "give in" but retain all your pristine courage, &amp; that
                "the inner fire still burns."</p>
            <p>"Oh to struggle against great odds.....to find out how much one can stand!"<ptr target="loc.02474_n5"/></p>
            <p>And <hi rend="underline">you,</hi> my noble hearted Old Friend, have <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> us how
                much you can stand, &amp; given the world a lesson it should not soon forget.</p>
            <p>God bless you now and always, &amp; grant you the "Peace which passeth all
                understanding!"<ptr target="loc.02474_n3"/></p> 
            <p>When I think of you in your loneliness &amp; feebleness <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.02474.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> my heart fairly yearns for you;
                &amp; oh how I fret myself at my own inability to <hi rend="underline">do</hi>
                anything for you! For what <hi rend="underline">can</hi> I do except write you a
                letter now &amp; again to reassure you of my continued &amp; ever-deepening personal
                affection &amp; reverence &amp; that we, on this side, are doing what little we can
                to extend your influence?</p>
            <p>What a dear, good fellow H.L.T. is to postpone his marriage<ptr target="loc.02481_n3"/> simply because he could
                not get a house near you! But <hi rend="underline">that</hi> is of-a-piece with all that we 
                know of him.
                His <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02474.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> self-denying
                devotion to you is very touching indeed &amp; we are glad to know that you have two
                such loyal &amp; true hearted souls as he &amp; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> to be with and to minister
                    to you.</p>
            <p>Last week I spent three days among my kinsfolk in the North; &amp; a very
                heart-gladdening time I had. The weather was almost typically spring-like in
                character&#8212;westerly winds with some rain &amp; intermittent sunshine &amp; the
                previously stagnant vegetation had made wonderful progress; the new corn 
                <choice><orig>shewing</orig><reg>showing</reg></choice>
                above the brown earth &amp; the trees &amp; hedgerows tipped with delicate green,
                feathery tufts.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02474.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>At Corby&#8212;a pretty little Cumberland village where my married sister<ptr target="loc.02519_n6"/>
                lives&#8212;I saw my first swallows of this spring, darting high overhead or
                skimming the sunlit waters of the beautiful River Eden. The woods there are now all
                carpeted with daffodils &amp; primroses; the greening meadows are bedecked with the
                yellow-starred celandine &amp; the "wee, modest crimson-tipped
                flower,"<ptr target="loc.02474_n6"/> with its golden eye; &amp; Nature is robing herself in her vernal mantle of
                "sight-refreshing green."<ptr target="loc.02474_n7"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02474.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>But my greatest Heart-joy was at Annan<ptr target="loc.02474_n8"/>&#8212;my native place&#8212;with my
                Father<ptr target="loc.02519_n5b"/>&#8212;my life-long Exemplar of Truth &amp; Righteousness&#8212;my
                Mother<ptr target="loc.02519_n5"/>&#8212;dearest &amp; best of womankind in all the world to me&#8212;my dear
                Brother<ptr target="loc.04820_n3"/> &amp; my old schoolfellows &amp; the friends of my boyhood.</p>
            <p>The first market-day in May is the "Fair-Day" at Annan &amp; I was present at this
                fair&#8212;the first time for about 15 years. It is a relic of olden times &amp;
                still preserves its primitive chahracter&#8212;shows, merry-go-rounds, conjurors,
                cheap Jacks, sweetie, toffee &amp; toy stalls, farm produce, shooting galleries,
                &amp;c &amp;c all 'in the streets.'</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02474.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>But <hi rend="underline">the</hi> peculiar feature about it is the Hiring system. The farmers &amp; the
                servants all congregate&#8212;in a certain portion of the High St &amp; when the
                master sees a servant whom he thinks likely to suit he accosts him or her &amp; by a
                series of questions &amp; answers an agreement is come to, the bargain being
                clinched by the giving &amp; receiving of some money&#8212;generally a shilling or
                two which is called the "earles"&#8212;thus constituting a legal contract binding
                upon both parties.</p>
            <p>I took some instantaneous photographs of some of the street
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02474.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> scenes &amp;
                if they turn out successfully I may send you on or two.</p>
            <p>After enjoying "all the fun of the fair" I strolled along the banks of my beloved
                "Annan Water"&#8212;a really beauitiful river which meanders its way from the Moffat
                hills, past the town &amp; on to the Solway Firth referred to by Scott<ptr target="n4277"/> in the
                line&#8212;"Love flows like the Solway but ebbs like its tide."<ptr target="loc.02474_n4"/></p>
            <p>This little river is associated with the happy days of my childhood &amp; it was with
                a swelling heart that I again looked upon the dear old spots where we used to play,
                run races, <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02474.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                gather wildflowers (&#8212;why there is the very bank where we used to pluck
                primroses!&#8212;) bathe, boat, fish, slide &amp;c.</p> 
            <p>What a hold these old days have upon one, &amp; what a host of heart-stirring, &amp;
                oh so sweet &amp; sacred memories, does the sight of the old, familiar place &amp;
                faces arouse within us! And with what a mighty &amp; irresistable force does our old
                Home &amp; its dear associations pull at our heart strings!</p>
            <p><hi rend="underline">You wd</hi> <choice><orig>realise</orig><reg>realize</reg></choice> all this the last time you visited your dear
                old Home at "West Hills" with Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> where I spent such a blissfully happy time
                    <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02474.010_large.jpg" type="verso"/>last
                summer&#8212;never to be forgotten by me.</p> 
            <p>I am looking forward with a curious interest to seeing the <hi rend="underline">N.E
                Mag</hi> with H.L.T.'s article on you &amp; some of my photographs,<ptr target="loc.07318_n1"/> &amp; I hope
                that the tampering with the M.S.&#8212;a most indefensible proceeding&#8212;will not
                materially injure the article.</p>
            <p>Since my return I have been kept extra busy owing to a renewed outbreak of the
                Influenza in Bolton in Common with other towns in England &amp; I am now single
                handed as my assistant<ptr target="n5001"/> has gone up to Edinburgh for his final <pb
                    xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.02474.011_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Examination this
                week</p>
            <p>I notice that John Burroughs<ptr target="nyp.00210_n7"/> is announced to contribute an article on "Wild Flowers"
                to <hi rend="underline">St. Nicholas</hi> soon.</p>
            <p>This has been a truly magnificent day&#8212;soft balmy airs, brilliant sunshine
                &amp; Spring's benignant presence evident everywhere</p>
            <p>I quite enjoyed my long round of visits this morning &amp; especially the drive in
                the Country where the gardens are now all radiant with blossom&#8212;the white bloom
                of the cherry &amp; the plum (&#8212;the plum blossom appears <hi rend="underline"
                    >before</hi> the leaves) &amp; the sweetly delicate pink &amp; <pb

                blossom than which, I think, there is nothing prettier. </p>
            <p>I saw J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> at noon today. He seems to be better again.</p>
            <p>I send you a little book of photos of Annan with a small, local guide attached, wh.
                may interest you, both on a/c of my
                connection with the place &amp; because your old friends, the Romes,<ptr target="duk.00466_n4"/> are Annan men.
                I will send Andrew a copy too, I think.</p>
