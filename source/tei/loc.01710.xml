                        (1847&#8211;1914) made a bust from life of Abraham Lincoln, who agreed to
                        sit weekly for the young sculptor. After his assassination she was
                        commissioned to do a statue for the rotunda in the Capitol. When the work
                        was unveiled in 1871, there was some criticism of the first woman to execute
                        such a commission. Reproductions of her sculpture, as well as a portrait by
                        George Caleb Bingham and a bust by Clark MIlls, appear in <hi rend="italic"
