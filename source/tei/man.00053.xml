            <p>I received your much welcome note some time ago,<ptr target="n0844b"/> but have been so very busy that I
                have not had time to write to you. You cant think how pleased I was to get your
                letter and to learn that you thought of your Jersey friends while so far away from
                us, yet I was sorry to
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="man_ej.00223_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>to hear that you have been ill I hope when you get this you will
                be enjoying better health. Joe was very sick two or three weeks ago, but is better
                now; and I am enjoying my usual good health. I suppose you wonder what has kept <hi
                    rend="underline">me</hi> so busy I will tell you. Lizzie Hider<ptr target="nyp.00417_n3"/> has been staying
                with me for two weeks past, and I have had so much sewing to do for Ruth<ptr target="n1060"/>&#8212;
                getting ready for festivals, picnics and
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="man_ej.00224_large.jpg" type="recto"/>such&#8212;that it all has
                kept me very busy but the picnics will soon be over and then I shall not have so
                much to do</p>
            <p>Do you hear from the Gilchrists<ptr target="n3001"/> often it has been some time since Mother heard from
                them. You spoke of being reminded of me so much up there. I wish I could be there
                for I think I should enjoy a visit up that way very much and particularly this warm
                weather. I think you
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="man_ej.00149_large.jpg" type="verso"/> need to be glad you are away in a cool climate this warm weather, for it has been
                almost <hi rend="underline">hot</hi> enough to roast a body down here. It is getting late and news is scarce I
                will close</p>
