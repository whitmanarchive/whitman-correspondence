            <p>Quite sharp &#38; cold this forenoon, &#38; I am sitting by a good oak
                fire&#8212;Am still imprison'd in the sick room&#8212;Keep up spirits pretty fair,
                but weak as ever in my movements, &#38; being kept indoor for most nine months
                begins to tell on me&#8212;I almost wonder I keep as well as I do&#8212;but I have
                been pretty low&#8212;the doctors&#8212;even Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"
                />&#8212;gave me quite up more than once&#8212;They just kept life like a little
                light prevented from being all put out (&#38; this was the reason why I often had to
                deny friends from seeing me)&#8212;&#38; for a month or so I was in a horrible
                plight&#8212;a nuisance to myself &#38; all&#8212;but my nurse (Ed Wilkins,<ptr
                    target="n4319"/> the Canadian young man Dr. B. sent) stuck to me &#38; it has
                sort o' pass'd over&#8212;or at any rate the worst or it&#8212;At present I sit here in the room&#8212;Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> has
                just been in &#38; wishes to send her love to you, &#38; says come up &#38; see
                us&#8212;my mentality ab't the same as ever (tho' I get very soon sore &#38; tired
                reading, or being talked to)&#8212;&#38; not much show of being any
                better&#8212;thankful that things are as well as they are with me&#8212;for they
                might be much worse&#8212;</p>        
 
            <p>Susan, your good letter came this forenoon &#38; I was glad enough to hear
                from you all&#8212;I thank you so much for it I write all this rigmarole at

                fancy he is doing well, &#38; quite a fellow over there among the artists&#8212;I
                hear from Edw'd Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/>&#8212;he always wishes to be
                remembered to you all, specially Ed<ptr target="n0589c"/>&#8212;he seems to be well
                &#38; doing well.&#8212;</p>

                at Blackwood&#8212;(I yesterday paid the
                three months board bill $45.50 there) he is well, &#38; seems to be well off &#38;
