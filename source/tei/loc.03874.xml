            <p>Quite sharp &amp; cold this forenoon, &amp; I am sitting by a good oak
                fire—Am still imprison'd in the sick room—Keep up spirits pretty fair,
                but weak as ever in my movements, &amp; being kept indoor for most nine months
                begins to tell on me—I almost wonder I keep as well as I do—but I have
                been pretty low—the doctors—even Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>—gave me quite up more than once—They just kept life like a little
                light prevented from being all put out (&amp; this was the reason why I often had to
                deny friends from seeing me)—&amp; for a month or so I was in a horrible
                plight—a nuisance to myself &amp; all—but my nurse (Ed Wilkins,<ptr target="n4319"/> the Canadian young man Dr. B. sent) stuck to me &amp; it has
                sort o' pass'd over—or at any rate the worst or it—At present I sit here in the room—Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> has
                just been in &amp; wishes to send her love to you, &amp; says come up &amp; see
                us—my mentality ab't the same as ever (tho' I get very soon sore &amp; tired
                reading, or being talked to)—&amp; not much show of being any
                better—thankful that things are as well as they are with me—for they
                might be much worse—</p>        
 
            <p>Susan, your good letter came this forenoon &amp; I was glad enough to hear
                from you all—I thank you so much for it I write all this rigmarole at
                    once—Herbert<ptr target="n0262"/> paid me quite a visit last evn'g—I
                fancy he is doing well, &amp; quite a fellow over there among the artists—I
                hear from Edw'd Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/>—he always wishes to be
                remembered to you all, specially Ed<ptr target="n0589c"/>—he seems to be well
                &amp; doing well.—</p>

            <p>My books are all completed, these last editions, wh' is a great relief. Eddy<ptr target="n0699"/> my crippled brother is still 
                at Blackwood—(I yesterday paid the
                three months board bill $45.50 there) he is well, &amp; seems to be well off &amp;
                satisfied—young Harry Bonsall<ptr target="loc.03874_n2"/> died there three or four weeks ago—my sisters
                at Greenport L I<ptr target="n0386"/> and Burlington Vermont<ptr target="loc.02867_n2"/> are ab't as usual—my brother &amp;<ptr target="n0700"/>
                sister Lou<ptr target="n0696"/> are well at Burlington this state—I think quite often of Harry,<ptr target="n4310"/> &amp; wish you would send this letter over to him
                without fail the first chance you get—it is written largely to him—I
                have what I call <hi rend="italic">sinking spells</hi> in my sickness, &amp; I had one the day he last
                visited me—</p>
