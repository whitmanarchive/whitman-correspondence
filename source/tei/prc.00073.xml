                <salute>Dear Hank</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours of yesterday <choice>
                <orig>rec'd</orig>
                <reg>received</reg>
            </choice> this afternoon, &amp; glad to hear from you &amp; the
                folks—I hear from you now &amp; then by Hoag<ptr target="prc.00073_n2"/> or
                Burr, who tell me they meet you up here frequently—(I wish you had said how
                Hieneken is getting along—is he getting better?)</p>
            <p>Well, Hank, my Boston tramp, lecture, &amp;c. turned out far ahead of what I had any
                idea of—it was not a very large room, but it was packed full (at $1 a head)
                &amp; they say there never was a more <hi rend="italic">high toned crowd</hi>
                collected in the town—full half were ladies, &amp; I never saw finer
                ones—I had good quarters at the principal hotel, the Revere House,
                (dead-headed, the proprietor, Mr Ferrin invited me to stay as long as I
                liked)—&amp; callers all the time—So, boy, you see how your uncle was
                    <hi rend="italic">set up</hi>—&amp; yet I am going to speak to all my old
                friends just the same! !</p>
            <p>Have had several little jobs writing lately—<choice><orig>Phila:</orig><reg>Philadelphia</reg>
            </choice> and N. Y. papers<ptr target="prc.00073_n3"/>—(will send you the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi>
                of the latter city next Monday or Tuesday with my piece in)—<choice><orig>Havn't</orig><reg>Haven't</reg>
                </choice> felt very
                well lately—a real bad spell last night &amp; this forenoon—don't feel
                right living in the city any how, after the summer comes on—very possibly
                shall go off to Canada again, as Dr and Mrs B[ucke] wish me to, &amp; write
                strongly—</p>
            <p>I sent you a little book of poetry by a boy 13 years old, in Pennsylvania, he sent it
                to me with a nice letter<ptr target="prc.00073_n4"/>—Well, Hank, my sheet is
                short &amp; most full, &amp; I must come to a close—I gather by your letter
                that you are in good spirits—love to you &amp; God bless you—I am sorry
                enough to hear your mother is unwell—Susan, my dear friend, I hope when this
                comes you will be all right—</p>

            </closer>
            <postscript>
                <p>I suppose your mother got a letter &amp; some papers from Boston,<ptr target="prc.00073_n5"/> as I sent them, &amp; of course supposed you would
                    all read them—my best love to your mother &amp; father &amp; I want you to
                    let them read this—</p>
