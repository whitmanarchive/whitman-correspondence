                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>

            <p>Here I am back from <choice>
                    <sic>Pokeepsie</sic>
                    <corr>Poughkeepsie</corr>
                </choice> in my little study to-night with a maple &amp; hickory fire burning in the
                open fire place &amp; thinking of you. This little shanty is a real solitude, cut
                off from the house &amp; standing alone here on the brow of the hill. A wild rabbit
                lives under the floor &amp; the wild wood mice scamper over head. But few of my friends
                have
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01175.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                visited me here, but here I sit by my open fire &amp; have long long thoughts of
                them. How I make them come trooping in. How many times have I planted you there in
                my big chair by the window, or here in front of the open fire &amp; talked the old
                talk with you. Alas, alas, that I should never see you here in the body as well as
                in the spirit. I talk at O'Connors<ptr target="n2002"/> picture &amp; think of him
                too so often, the brilliant one whom I shall see no more.
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01175.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            How sacred is memory! as we grow old how much he lives in the past, how trivial &amp;
                cheap seems the present. A tender &amp; beautiful light fills my mind when I think
                of those years in Washington when we were all there; a light I know that never was
                on sea or land. How solemn &amp; pathetic, as well as beautiful it must seem to you,
                considering all you passed through there!</p> 
            <p>Chas. Eldridge<ptr target="n0210"/> sends me his wedding cards from California. I am
                glad he is married &amp; hope he is happy &amp; prosperous. I must write to him.
                Give him
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01175.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            my love if you write him. I think I told you we were housekeeping in <choice>

                    <corr>Poughkeepsie</corr>
                </choice> for the winter. Mrs B<ptr target="n0892"/> &amp; Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> are there now, but I am back on my farm &amp; at work
                for the past two days, &amp; I find it much better than hanging about the miserable
                little city. My winter has been flat stale &amp; unprofitable. I mean to delve the
                earth with vigor now to make up for it. I have seen nobody nor been anywhere. Should
                probably have gone to W. had not wife been sick for 5 weeks with the gripe. I get a
                glimpse of you now &amp; then in the paper. I hope you are comfortable. Do drop me a
                card if you can, or<ptr target="loc.01175_n1"/> ask <choice><sic>Trauble</sic><corr>Traubel</corr></choice><ptr target="n4267"/> 
                to write me. Our winter has been a perpetual spring as I suppose yours has.</p>
