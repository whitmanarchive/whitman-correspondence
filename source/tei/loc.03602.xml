                <salute>Dear Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of 11 <choice><abbr>Oct.</abbr><expan>October</expan></choice> has been with me some little while, during <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> my leisure has been of the scantiest.<ptr target="n0522"/> It is so still, &amp; may make me cut this shorter than I <choice><abbr>shd.</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> like.</p>
            
            <p>You say: "I suppose you got my postals on sending the books to J.A. Rose."<ptr target="n0916"/> To the best of my recollection I never did get these: I am aware however that as a matter of fact Rose is in possession of your books, but have not seen him since he received them.</p>
            
            <p>I feel ashamed for my

            colleagues the English men of the press that the Editor of the Examiner <choice><abbr>sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> have failed to pay you his just debt,<ptr target="n0038"/> especially after the 2 or 3 times that I raised the question with him, &amp; he once of his own accord with me. He is a man I seldom meet: but I do meet him sometimes, &amp;, whenever this may happen next, I shall (if opportunity allows) remind him of his obligation, &amp; I trust he may yet attend to it.</p>
            
            <p>I posted to the Editor of the Secularist the letter to him <choice><abbr>wh</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> you enclosed: &amp; herewith I forward his reply. This is all I know of the matter. I know a little of the Editor Mr. Foote<ptr target="n0238"/> himself, &amp; <choice><abbr>sh<hi rend="supersrcipt">d</hi>.</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> be very

            slow to suppose that he was personally in fault. The deep black border of his letter marks the recent death of his wife&#8212;a Miss Heimann, daughter of old friends of ours. Within the last 2 or 3 years she had shown mental excitability of a morbid kind: she married Foote 8 or 9 <choice><abbr>mos.</abbr><expan>months</expan></choice> ago I suppose, &amp; recently, say towards end of <choice><abbr>Septr.</abbr><expan>September</expan></choice>, "took an overdose of chloral," or in other words committed suicide. I mention these matters, not as being relevant to your concerns with Foote, but because I know that whatever calls for sympathy finds it in you.</p>
           
            <p>Your statement that Mrs. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0259"/> had undergone a surgical operation distressed us. You spoke of the trouble as just over however, &amp;
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03602.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            we heartily hope that so it is. Please to give her our affectionate regards &amp; greetings.</p>
            
            <p>I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> receive Burroughs's<ptr target="n0129"/> new book. Read carefully <choice><orig>thro</orig><corr>through</corr></choice>, with much pleasure, all that he says about you: the rest of the book I have had to leave unread as yet, in the press of my many occupations.</p>
            
            <p>All prosperity to you &amp; the Gilchrists in the coming year. I am glad to read what you say of Herbert &amp; Beatrice, &amp; fully credit your praises of them.</p>
