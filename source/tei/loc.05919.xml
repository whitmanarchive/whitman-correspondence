                being disposed of I want you to turn your attention seriously to coming here for the
                Summer. My plan is that sometime (any time) before the 1st June John Burroughs<ptr
                    target="n0129"/> should run down to Philadelphia and take you to Esopus then
                about 1st June I would go to Esopus and come on here. We all want you and will
                undertake to make you comfortable for the summer and for the winter too if you will
                stay. It is likely you will hear from Burroughs before very long and when you do let
                me know how the project strikes you<ptr target="loc.05919_n2"/></p>

                    and like it much. You did not mention before the change in your housekeeping
                    arrangements but Mr Smith<ptr target="loc.05919_n4"/> said something to me in a
                    letter about it. I am glad to hear that you are more comfortable but hope that
                    that fact will not decide you to stay home all summer instead of coming here as
                    you ought to do&#8212;</p>
