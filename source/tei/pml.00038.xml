Harry (No II) sends you his love says he wished you would go to the city Hall at the sheriffs office and see Michael Halloran tell him all about him (Harry) &amp; ask him how hose 48 is. &amp; if there is any chances of getting into the Fire Department  also to give my respects to all inquiring friends &amp; ask him if i can get one of the old Exempt Fire Badges. Dear Walt you have no idea how much interest the boys takes in your letters</p>
            
            <p>That second letter of yours has gone all around to them as you mentioned  you could not think how happy it makes them to think that you remember them. Pittsburg sends his love &amp; would like you to write to him  his address is Lewis Wraymond 7th St. R.R. office i could not see the young man Sy<unclear reason="illegible" resp="shively">d</unclear>nor  he is sick &amp; not at work. Jimmy the Californian on 7th St.  RR Jim Sorrill sends his love &amp; best respects &amp; says he is alive &amp; kicking but the most thing that he dont understand is that young Lady that said you make such a good bed fellow. also Charley Sorrill sends his love &amp; is glad to hear you are doing so well Towers is Very much pleased at your letter &amp; sends his love</p>
            
            <p>Henry Hurt sends his love &amp; is very thankful for the Broadway that you sent him  I saw another game of Base Ball last friday between the Cincinatti &amp; the <choice><orig>Olympix</orig><reg>Olympic</reg></choice>  the game was all one sided  at the end of the game the score stood Olympic, 22 &amp; the Cincinatti 9. I received your 3rd letter yesterday the 26 &amp; also a copy of the Broadway and am Very thankful for them  in Friday Star you will find some Remarks of Mr. Hinton in some of the Equal rights associations for Females</p>
            
            <p>There is nothing new here at present Congress all gone home &amp; everything Very dull  raining continually for nearly 2 weeks and everything looking Very miserable  I have been off for a few days but i resumed operations again yesterday the 26th  all seems to be quiet along the Potomac once more except a little skirmishing between the Sailor the Superintendent &amp; the Rail Road boys <choice><orig>occasionaly</orig><reg>occasionally</reg></choice> let me know if you get the Star every evening</p>
