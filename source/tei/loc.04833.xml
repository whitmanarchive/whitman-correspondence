                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I cannot tell you how glad I am to write to you again with some confidence 
                that you will be able to read it yourself. I only pray
                that you may recover sufficient strength to enjoy some measure of comfort &amp; ease.<ptr target="loc.02538_n4b"/></p>
            <p>The last 2 days
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01996_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                have been a happy joyful release from the heavy cares &amp; anxieties 
                of several weeks past. Do not think us thoughtless or
                inconsiderate, or altogether selfish that we welcome your 
                partial recovery with so great a joy. The world has seemed to us,
                during your illness, half emptied of its warmth &amp; love. 
                We have learned, in bitterness &amp; grief, how much the love
                between us means &amp; how deep it goes. And it is an immense 
                joy to us to find that it is to be ours still.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01997_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <p>The last mail brought letters from Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> which 
                were the first to give us solid grounds of hope. And it astonishes me to find 
                how gladdening &amp; vitalizing is the joyous sense of release—as 
                of a long &amp; heavy load removed. May God bless you
                &amp; give you comfort &amp; strength.</p>
            <p>Horace has been marvellously good to <hi rend="underline">us</hi>, 
                as well as to you. Daily &amp; faithfully he sends us bulletins
                of your condition, and under trying circumstance &amp; heavy 
                press of affairs steadfastly
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01998_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                shows us loving kindess like a brother's. I cannot thank him or 
                respond to his kindness as he deserves. Perhaps <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, whom
                he loves &amp; reveres as we do beyond all others, will thank him for us? 
                That will please him best of all.</p>
            <p>I will not write much now, but I am very happy in the prospect of writing again.
                My dearest love to you. &amp; my most fervent prayers &amp; good wishes
                are yours always.</p>
