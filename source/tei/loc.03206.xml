                <salute>Dear W&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was pleased to get your brief word about yourself, even though you report your
                imprisonment. I am glad you have been able to bring your books<ptr target="n6127"/> so near completion.
                No one could have done it but yourself with the same satisfaction to your
                friends.</p>
            <p>There seems to be a sort of providence in <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03206.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> one's life who has the courage to
                peg away, &#38; to wait, when he can't peg. Somehow the pegging gets done at what
                finally seems to have been the right &#38; opportune moment; &#38; the result
                abides.</p>
            <p>One has no business to be disappointed, or to stay so long&#8212;<hi rend="underline"
                    >He</hi> don't know. The Enquirer cries "stop"&#8212;"cant be"&#8212;"wait" "get
                sick&#8212;stay sick"&#8212;"die" <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.03206.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> "Dont die"&#8212;"start
                up"&#8212;"at it now"&#8212;"There! See?&#8212;How easy? What was your fuming
                about?"&#8212;"Now, a good laugh before you die.&#8212;All's well!"</p>
            <p><hi rend="underline">This</hi> to the <hi rend="underline">Ideal</hi> worker.</p>
            <p>The "<hi rend="underline">business</hi> man" with possessions vast (won or to be won)
                has his tribulations, but of another sort.</p>
            <p>No such humiliations&#8212;and no such victims!</p>
            <p>I went yesterday to hear Prof Swing<ptr target="loc.03206_n1"/> preach. If you dont know about him, Horace<ptr
                    target="n4267"/> will tell you. He said some bright things. One: "Many promising
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03206.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> lad goes
                through Cambridge &#38; Oxford &#38; on through time into oblivion quoting his Greek
                &#38; Latin. And many a poor <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#cb"
                    >unfriended</unclear> boy rises up out of the gutter where he was born &#38;
                climbs into the heights of knowledge &#38; wisdom. Verily the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Spirit</hi> cares for its own." (Or words to this effect). Chicago has better
                preachers than Boston. There is greater inspiration in their utterances. They seem
                to be spiritually more awake&#8212;<hi rend="underline">alert</hi>. Foregleaming,
                foreseeing! The great, vast bulk of of a city weighs on the senses like a nightmare,
                but if one doesnt care a button for his fine senses, he can escape into a great
                liberation of music &#38; spirit. <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.03206.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> "What is your city with its
                temples &#38; walls? I can tear it all down &#38; build it again in three days,"
                said Jesus.</p>
            <p>How the old sense-ridden Jew must have glowered &#38; foamed!</p> 
            <p>"Why, it would take a hundred years to build the walls alone."</p>
            <p>Chicago has been a building for 50 years only. And what a wonderful spread it has
                made! I like it, I enjoy it. The boulevards stretching miles <pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc.03206.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> miles white &#38; clean&#8212; 
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#smb"
                        >yea</unclear>, as far as the eye can reach,
                make me stop &#38; look up &#38; down there a long time. I dont care much for the
                great buildings&#8212;from the tops of some of them you can almost touch the moon.
                I like to get on the grip-car &#38; ride through the long tunnel&#8212;every now
                &#38; then a <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#smb"
                    >mick</unclear> with a small electric light. Everybody was saying "Look out for
                the grip-car or you'll get killed. So many have."</p>
            <p>Ha, ha, ha! What cowards <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03206.007_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> these people be! Make things, &#38; then get afraid of them.</p>
            <p>The Lincoln statue<ptr target="loc.03206_n2"/> is good. The face has a vast deal in it. The figure is Lincolnish.
                I have seen it now 3 times, &#38; I find a little fault with its eternally standing
                there before that chair. The chair part is as the critics say, "a bold conception,"
                but whether tis not an infraction of the old Greek admonition, as being "too bold?" I
                believe on the whole, I would not have put it there&#8212;or anywhere. The modeling
                is strong, but a little too much done. The hair, however, is better than represented in the engraving &#38;
                on the whole, I know of <gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="word"/> <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.03206.008_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> other public statue as good.</p>
            <p>But on the streets here I find some half <choice>
                    <orig>dozzen</orig> 
                    <reg>dozen</reg>
            </choice> statues (Scott,<ptr target="n4277"/> Burns,<ptr target="loc.01153_n2"/> &#38; others) done by some unfamed fellow for &#36;100
                each in grey sandstone, that far surpasses it. I find myself always stopped by them
                with a half defined expectancy that they are going to say something to me. By the
                way this stone would be just the thing for your bust. Beats marble a hundred per
                cent.</p>
            <p>Well, I should like to see you that I might at least lay aside this scratchy pen,
                &#38; say &#38; hear you say. But&#8212;. I have no studio yet, but am on the look
                for one, with some encouragement of work. Rent here is way up. Kind remembrances to
                your faithful housekeeper.<ptr target="n6113"/></p>
