                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>I can't write much tonight, but I want to send you a few lines by this mail.</p>
            <p>Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> called to see me yesterday &#38; had dinner with me
                (in Bolton). I spoke of my last letter to you, &#38; said that if I had had a spare
                copy of his photo: I would have sent
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01064.jpg" type="verso"/>
            it to you.&#8212;So, this morning, I was pleased to receive a letter from him
                enclosing one, which I forward herewith.</p>
            <p>He is very much pleased with his copy of L. of G.,<ptr target="loc.02457_n3"/> (he is
                an old lover of yours,) &#38; regards its presentation from Johnston<ptr
                    target="n4102"/> &#38; myself as "another token of our brotherhood," covenanted
                anew in your dear &#38; honoured name. He hopes that the influence of the book
                "may
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01065.jpg" type="recto"/>
            bind our hearts more firmly together in the coming years," &#38; asks me, when I
                write to you again, "to at least send you his warmest love &#38; good
                wishes."&#8212;I am glad to do so at once, for I know well how sincere &#38; deep
                his love &#38; admiration for you are.</p>
            <p>He is not "literary" at all, though he is not without appreciation of the <hi
                    rend="underline">best</hi> literatures. He has an artist's eye for the beauties
                of
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01066.jpg" type="verso"/>
            Nature (paints a little), but prefers Nature at first hand, with its vital freshness
                &#38; movement. (Loves <hi rend="underline">the sea</hi> especially&#8212;boating,
                sailing, fishing &#38;c). He is not conventional, but rather too <hi
                    rend="underline">un</hi>conventional, &#38; always prefers to be considered much
                worse than he is, rather than better. He has a wild, native wit of his own, &#38; is
                frank, outspoken &#38; free, in speech &#38; manners&#8212;But he is liked at once
                by all wherever he goes. And, at
           <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01067.jpg" type="recto"/>
           the heart of him is a deep, constant affectionateness, faithful &#38; unswerving,
                &#38; a native reverence of soul, all the deeper because so impatient of make-belief
                as to seem <hi rend="underline">ir</hi>reverent &#38; irreligious. He has a wife
                &#38; four children of whom he is fond. And I, his friend &#38; intimate chum from
                boyhood, have found him stedfastly loyal &#38; true &#38; affectionate, through
                thick &#38; thin.</p>
            <p>I wish the portrait were a better one, but such
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01068.jpg" type="verso"/>
            as it is, it may serve as a message of his personal love &#38; adhesion.</p>
            <p>I rejoice to think that natures like his respond to you so spontaneously &#38; so
                warmly. You can afford to let the literary classes stand in antagonism to you
                (though it can be for a short time only), while the masses (the great majority,) who
                deal with life &#38; nature &#38; experience at first hand, &#38; who despise
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01069.jpg" type="recto"/> 
            second hand presentations in books &#38; art, see in you a master, as fresh &#38;
                vital as Nature itself, offering them love &#38; faith, &#38; vistas before
                unknown.</p>
            <p>I hope that you are better, &#38; your "health points" more "favourable" than when
                you wrote last.</p>
            <p>With love to you always</p>  
            <closer>
                <salute>I remain</salute>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
