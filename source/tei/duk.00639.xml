            <p>I was so glad Walt
            to hear you was better
            of the distress in your
            head<ptr target="duk.00639_n9"/>
            the carrier was
            later than usual and
            <choice><orig>george</orig><reg>George</reg></choice><ptr target="duk.00425_n2"/> came home
            to his dinner and said
            he saw a carrier in
            Bedford <choice><orig>aven</orig> <reg>Avenue</reg></choice> so i thought
            you was worse and
            the thoughts that run
            through my head in
            five minutes you wou<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#wr">ld</unclear>

            and the letter man
            called out <choice><orig>mrs</orig><reg>Mrs.</reg></choice> Whitman
            then i thought how
            foolish i was to
            be worried before i 
            knew any thing to be
            worried about)</p>
            <p>i have had a letter
            from Heyde he says
            han<ptr target="duk.00639_n12"/> is well except
            her hand he says
            she <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> give it a

            girl he says she is a
            dirty brute that is his

            expression and he
            shall change again
            i felt very glad even
            to hear from him)
            i think really han might
            write as i have requested
            her so much her
            right hand she could
            write a few lines anyhow
            i hope you <choice><orig>wont</orig> <reg>won't</reg></choice> have
