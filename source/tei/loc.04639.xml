            <p>I know you will not think me bold in thus addressing you—when I tell you that I
                have known you for years <hi rend="underline">through your poems</hi> and although I
                am a perfect stranger to you yet you can never be a stranger to me, for have you not
                given to us all the rich outpourings of your generous heart in your "Blades of
                Grass?"</p>
            <p>These poems have been the "windows of your soul" and through <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02486.jpg" type="verso"/> them I have looked into your
                heart—that heart large enough to call all men your brothers, all women
                Sisters! Hence I consider myself one of your sisters—albeit we may never meet
                on this planet, and this must be my excuse for writing you.</p>
            <p>I was much pleased with two portraits I saw of you the other evening at Mrs J.H.
                Johnston's<ptr target="n3330"/> 305 East 17th Street. One was an oil painting, the other a magnificent
                crayon. As I stood before the latter our host came up and said "I consider that the
                finest picture in the world!" This will give you some idea of his <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02487.jpg" type="recto"/> enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Under cover of this envelope I send you copies of my little magazine and hope you
                will do me the honor to glance over them. I have taken up what I believe to be a
                good life work and the giving of many happy hours to our "little women."</p>
            <p>I trust you have enjoyed these three days of sunshine and that you have been able to
                go down to the river each day.</p>
            <p>Hoping I have not tired you with my letter and that you have not felt it an intrusion</p>
            <closer>
