            <p>I received your letter on the 8th, &amp; was very glad to hear from you. I wrote to you, about 18 months ago; I wrote twice, but, as I did not get an answer, I concluded that you had not received them. The I saw in the paper that you were out in <name>Canada</name>, taking your vacation, so I did not write again, not knowing where to direct. I am sorry to hear that you have been sick, but glad to hear that you are getting well again. You asked about my Grand-Mother, she is alive, but, I cannot say well. She has had the Asthma pretty bad, but is not so much troubled by it now. She has the dropsy also.

            <p>The rest of us are enjoying pretty good health. I have 3 Brothers, Garrie, <choice><sic>Georg</sic><corr>George</corr></choice> <!-- are we sure it's meant to be "George"?

Grand-Mother 87. I go to school every day, to the public school. I attended an Academy last winter, but, my teacher went away, so I stopped going there&#8212;</p>
            <p>We are having a very mild winter, the ground having been bare for a week or two, &amp; no frost in the ground. Uncle George was up here last fall to see Grand Mother, but has not been here since. You wrote me a very short letter, so it would not look well for me to write a long one. I hope you will come up &amp; see Grand Mother &amp; the rest of us as soon as you

            <p>I thank you very much for all you have sent me. I would send you my picture but I want you to come and see me myself.</p>
