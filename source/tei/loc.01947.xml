            <p>I received your letter on the 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr target="n5002d"/> &amp; was 
                very glad to hear from you. I wrote to you, about <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#aja">18</unclear> months ago; I wrote twice, but, as I did 
                not get an answer, I concluded that you had not received them. Then I saw in the paper, that you 
                were out in Canada, taking your vacation, so I did not write again, not knowing where to direct. 
                I am sorry to hear that you have been sick, but glad to hear that you are getting well again.<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> 
                You asked about my Grand-Mother,<ptr target="loc.01947_n3"/> she is alive, but, I cannot say well. She 
                has had the Asthma pretty bad, but is not so much troubled with it now. She has the dropsy also.

                She has not been in bed for nearly a month, &amp; is entirely deprived of the use of her legs.</p>

            <p>I go to school every day, to the public school. I attended an Academy last winter, but, my teacher 
                went away, so I stopped going there</p>
            <p>We are having a very mild winter, the ground having been bare for a week or two, &amp; no frost in 
                the ground. Uncle George<ptr target="loc.03675_n3"/> was up here last fall to see Grand Mother, but has 
                not been here since. You wrote me a very short letter, so it would not look well for me to write 
                a long one. I hope you will come up &amp; see Grand Mother &amp; the rest of us as soon as you

                get able. We have been repairing the house &amp; have plenty of room</p>
            <p>I thank you very much for all you have sent me. I would send you my picture but I want you to come 
                &amp; see me myself.</p>
