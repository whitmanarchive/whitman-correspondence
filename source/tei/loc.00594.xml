         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00594_n100"/> have not forgotten you in the wanderings from Washington here.  After five days and nights jolting in the cars I reached this point and was put on duty instanter&#8212;And such duty!  Why I have worked night and day and it appears there is more to do now than when I came.</p>
            <p>They only allow one steward to each Hospital, and it is an irksome office when such is the case. I am doing finely and in the course of a few weeks I think will have some leisure time. The Hospitals here were in a destitute condition, compared with those of the North. When I came to this Hospital they had no clothes to change <hi rend="italic">one fourth</hi> of the patients. I immediately appealed to my lady friends and patriots in Philadelphia, and they have sent me on a fine lot of sanitary stores, yet not enough for the wants of the many admitted. Our Hospt is a large five story building and accommodates between 300 &amp; 400 patients, most of whom are wounded in the continual skirmishing about Murfreesboro and Franklin.</p>
            <p>I have never had better health in my life, perhaps I can explain it to you. I have five young ladies who act in the capacity of nurses&#8212;i e, <hi rend="italic">one of them is French</hi>, young and beautiful to set your eyes upon. Can you not visit us and note for yourself? I think a change of climate will be beneficial.</p>
            <p>How are Jack and Amos?<ptr target="loc.00594_n2"/> I wish you would give me Amos's address, as I have lost the one he gave me. My regards to them and hope they are out of Campbell Hospital. What became of poor Dick?</p>
            <p>I have been so busy I have neglected all correspondence so you will readily forget the seeming neglect</p>
