                <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have your card of 9th,<ptr target="loc.07207_n1"/> I am very glad to hear that
                there is a chance of Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> coming this way,<ptr target="loc.07207_n2"/> please tell him so. You have evidently made up your
                mind not to go to England and you are wise to have done so. Mr &amp; Miss Smith<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> I suppose sailed yesterday. I am glad to hear of the
                advent of the little girl Rachel<ptr target="n3137"/>. Wish they would get something
                settled (one way or the other) about that seaside cottage<ptr target="prc.00121_n3"/>— 
                if that scheme is not
                carried out you had better come here yet, you really must not remain in Camden all
                Summer—I do wish it was settled that you were to leave there soon and where
                you were going, it must be getting very warm with you—here it is cool and
                pleasant—no end of grass and trees <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00237.jpg" type="verso"/> (you would not know the place the trees
                have grown so since 1880). I am very anxious to see "Specimen Days in Am" and do not
                understand why I have not a copy by this time, Rhys<ptr target="loc.03310_n1"/> was
                to send me one as soon as the book was out—but if you have a copy to share by
                all means send me one as you propose. I am more and more pleased with the last
                photo. think it is grand. So J. N. Johnson<ptr target="n0914"/> is still in your
                neighborhood. You do not say whether he is coming further North, I fear not, but
                please tell him (if you have not already) that I should like much to have a visit
                from him if the thing is at all on the cards. I hope you will be feeling better by
                the time you get this but I doubt if you get much better until you get out of
                Camden, a change of air would do you more good now than any thing. We are prepared
                to make you comfortable (if the thing is possible) if you will come to us. I send
                you my love and am always affectionately yours</p>
