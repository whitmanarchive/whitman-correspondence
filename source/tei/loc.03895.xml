            <p>I am still laid up here quite sick<ptr target="loc.03895_n1"/>&#8212;last week has
                been about the same as the previous one with me&#8212;I am up &#38; drest, but dont
                go out&#8212;the weather is in my favor here,&#8212;if it was as hot here as it seems
                to be most of the time in Philadelphia, it would go hard with me&#8212;They are as
                kind &#38; good as can be, both Dr and Mrs Bucke&#8212;then I have a horse &#38;
                little basket-wagon appropriated to me, to go out by myself, or be driven out just
                whenever I like&#8212;but to be deprest &#38; sick prevents any thing being
                enjoyed&#8212;But enough of this&#8212;I have no doubt it will pass over, as it has
                times before&#8212;</p>

            <p>The country here is beautiful with hay &#38; wheat&#8212;they are just now in the
                height of harvest for both, &#38; I watch them from<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00482_large.jpg" type="verso"/> my windows&#8212;We have rain every
                third or fourth day (just now a little too much)&#8212;Dr Bucke has a big house
                &#38; a great many visitors&#8212;from two or three to five or six here nearly all
                the time&#8212;two fine young ladies staying all the time, with Mrs B &#38; a
                governess for his younger children&#8212;I tell you if I felt well I should have
                great times&#8212;even as it is we have some jovial hours&#8212;last evening nothing
                would do but I had to come in the parlor &#38; sing a couple of verses of "Black
                Eye'd Susan"&#8212;</p>

            <p>If I get all right, the plan is three of us, Doctor &#38; another man &#38; myself
                to go down the Lakes, and all down the St Lawrence, (the "Thousand Islands" &#38;c)
                and so on far north to a great river, the Saguenay, I have always wanted to
                see&#8212;&#38; so to Quebec&#8212;will take three weeks&#8212;but I will have to
                feel very different from what I do now&#8212;</p>

            <p>Well I must close&#8212;How are you all? Is George well this summer? Is Harry well
                &#38; in the store? This is about the <hi rend="underline">eighth</hi> or <hi
                    rend="underline">ninth</hi> document I have sent to you from Canada&#8212;counting
                papers, letters, postal cards, &#38;c. (one to Harry from Lake Huron) &#38; <hi

                        <corr>haven't</corr>
                    </choice> had a single breath of reply from any of you</hi>&#8212;Susan I
                enclose you an envelope&#8212;Love to all&#8212;</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>I shall get well, no doubt, &#38; be coming back like a bad penny toward the end
                    of the summer.</p>
