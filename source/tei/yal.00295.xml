            <p>The sea ought to be grateful to you; for its shifting mounds &#38; boundless heave have
                been dumb from Eternity until you voiced them in deep human music.
            Is there such a thing as a makrophone, to render in vocal facsimile &#38; miniature
                the thunders &#38; voices of great sounds? It seems to me you do this in <choice><orig>yr</orig><reg>your</reg></choice>

                curling over on the polished mirror of the sand, how deftly the wind took each wave
                and tossed back from it a helmet-crest of white spray. I feel terribly presumptuous
                in making a suggestion to you, for there is not a word, a collection of words in <choice><orig>yr</orig><reg>your</reg></choice>
                work that is not deeply studied &#38; profoundly implicated in the general tissue of
