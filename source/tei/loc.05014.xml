                <salute><handShift rend="typescript"/>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>I am delighted with a great rain storm which has 
                just come up &#38; has forced us to send the horses back to the stable,
                because it <choice><sic>gaves</sic><corr>gave</corr></choice> me a chance of sending a note to thee by this mid week's post 
                to <choice><sic>thamk</sic><corr>thank</corr></choice> thee for thy postal card of 
                Aug. 4th,<ptr target="loc.05014_n2"/> with its good news of strength to stand "The hottest day of the season."</p>
            
            <p><handShift rend="typescript"/>I wish we could import a little of our cool, not to say 
                cold, weather to the other side of the <choice><sic>Allantic</sic><corr>Atlantic</corr></choice>. 
                The newspapers all speak of it as the 'bleak weather of July &#38; August' &#38; we have all
                been really suffering with cold almost ever since we came up to Wales. Still we have so many out-of-door 
                pursuits that we like it better than very hot weather. We have discovered a boat on the lake, &#38; have 
                found out that the water is not too cold for bathing, &#38; we have put the tennis court in order, so that 
                in the brief intervals between the showers, we have a great many things to do. This week, however, the 'children'
                have deserted us: They have all gone off to Cornwall to be with a party of young Quakers who always assemble at 
                Falmouth for the month of August. So 
                Papa<ptr target="n4979"/> &#38; the baby<ptr target="n3137"/> &#38; Frank<ptr target="n3133"/> &#38; I are left to our own devices.
                I cannot say we have done anything that savours of marked originality so far, as Frank &#38; I have spent nearly 
                our whole time doing work on the markets commission. I am engaged in a fierce contest with this typewriter, but
                I think I shall soon have conquered it far enough to write a respectable letter. At present I have to spell 
                every <choice><sic>wordl</sic><corr>word</corr></choice> laboriously though, so I cannot say anything, I am afraid, 
                to interest thee. But at any rate I can 
                send warmest love from Papa &#38; myself &#38; tell thee that we <choice><sic>think&#38;</sic><corr>thank 
                    &#38;</corr></choice> talk constantly of thee.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute><handShift rend="typescript"/>Thy loving friend,</salute>

            </closer>
            <postscript>
                <p>
                <handShift rend="manuscript"/>The rain has just cleared away, so I shall drive with this to the post.
