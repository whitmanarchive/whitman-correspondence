            <p>I have just rec'd your letter—I thought of you during that storm—it was very severe here too, 
                &amp; awful gales of wind one or two nights—The dinner in the Hospital<ptr target="tex.00182_n1"/>
                was a complete success—there was plenty, &amp; good too—turkey &amp; four or five kinds of vegetables, &amp; mince pie, &amp;c—then I purchased a large quantity of navy plug, &amp; smoking tobacco, &amp; pipes, &amp;c. and after dinner
                every body that wanted to, had a good smoke—&amp; I had a lot of oranges, apples, &amp;c. &amp; a large sugar cake for supper—then I read some amusing pieces to them for three quarters of an hour, for a change—&amp; sat down by those who were worst off—&amp;c. &amp;c. Nobody else came in that day. 
                They have a Chaplain, but he is miserable coot, like the rest of his tribe.
            </p>
            
            <p>I have written again to Han—
                I am writing this in the office, all alone—I am going down to the Hospital for a little while, &amp; to carry some tobacco—&amp; then I am invited to O'Connor's to dinner at 4 o'clock—we are to have cold turkey, hot vegetables, &amp;c—They are going to stay where they are till next March. 
                We have had quite a snow storm here—it is snowing moderately now. 
                Some are out with their sleighs. I am glad to hear such a good account of Eddy.
                It makes me feel quite satisfied.

            <p>I had a visit from Bayard Taylor,<ptr target="tex.00182_n2"/> a few days since.</p>
            
            <p>Well good bye for this time, dear mother.</p>
