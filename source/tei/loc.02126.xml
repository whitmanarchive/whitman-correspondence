			<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
			<p>Enclosed, you will find a few pages composed of selections from your work sandwiched 
				with Col. Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> 
				<hi rend="underline">Summing up</hi> in his address at Phil'a of the 21st of Oct last.<ptr target="loc.07846_n8"/> I thought that closing portion of it 
            	especially admirable. And, a few days ago I some how fell upon this way of testing the integrity of the orator's statements.</p>
			<p> If I have not succeeded in verifying them, I have, at least, had a good deal of satisfaction in the attempt. Near the close 
				of my effort it occured to me that it might possibly amuse you a little to look it over.</p>
			<p> You will, doubtless, find the thing sufficiently fanciful, forced &#38; artificial, &#38; also, that I have presumed to take 
				a little liberty with the text, for which, please pardon.</p>
			<p> About thirty years ago I obtained a
			<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02126.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
				copy of "Leaves of Grass" of the Edition of '60&#8211;61&#8212;I have counted myself <hi rend="underline">in</hi>, as one its 
				its admirers ever since. &#38;, to be frank, it is one of the few books that the reading of has led me, from the start, to entertain 
				a warm-hearted interest in its author.</p>
			<p> Such sketches &#38; likenesses of yourself &#38; reviews of your works as have happened to fall in my way, I have attentively looked 
				over &#38; carefully treasured up&#8212;John Burroughs'<ptr target="n0129"/> "Walt Whitman" 
				I own &#38; am pleased with, also with the testimony of Emerson<ptr target="n1044"/> 
				&#38; Thoreau<ptr target="hun.00052_n3"/> upon the same subject.</p>
			<p> I well remember the latter person's mention in one of his letters, of being in Brooklyn with his friend Alcott<ptr target="n0741"/> 
				&#38; meeting you there years ago&#8212;&#38; his remarks that followed.</p>
			<p> I first read Ingersoll's oration in the N.Y. "Truth Seeker,"<ptr target="loc.03097_n1"/> but have since ordered it in book form. The 
				occasion of that gathering has seemed to me, grand &#38; unique. Nothing approaching it in history, as I remember, except what came 
				near happening to the poet, Tasso<ptr target="loc.02126_n4"/> at Rome in April of 1595<ptr target="loc.02126_n6"/>&#8212;</p> 
			<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02126.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
			<p> Please accept my most cordial congratulations &#38; best wishes for your health &#38; happiness.</p>
			<p> I suppose I saw daylight about two years before you, yet am still what might be called active (in body), &#38; am enjoying life as 
				much as ever, with a hopeful outlook toward the future.</p>
			<p> Please excuse this long, rambling letter from a stranger to you, &#38; if it has tired you, have the kindness to attribute it wholly 
				to the proverbial garrulity of old age, and still believe me,</p>
