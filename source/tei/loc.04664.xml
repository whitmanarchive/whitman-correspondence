                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>  
            </opener>
            <p>How I wish that you were here just now!—The day perfect,—clear air, warm
                sunshine, with just felt breezes—the beautiful, park-like grounds—&amp;
                the homely hospitality of your old friend,<ptr target="loc.04664_n3"/> &amp; of his wife and family.—If
                only we had a fortunatus-hat<ptr target="loc.04664_n2"/> or wishing cloak to put at your disposal, we would
                instantly waft you here.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed the journey here immensely. The novelty of the luxurious Sleeping Car
                interested me to begin with, and everything was new &amp; interesting. We<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00888.jpg" type="verso"/> turned in about
                10 oclock, &amp; both enjoyed a refreshing night's sleep. Morning clear &amp; fresh
                &amp; beautiful—the landscape &amp; farmsteads American!—Stopped for an
                hour &amp; a quarter at Buffalo, where we had breakfast. Arrived at Niagara Falls
                (Canadian side) about 11.15 &amp; had to wait for a train @ 3.—So, after the
                Custom House officers had examined our Baggage we took a conveyance to the Falls.
                Took long looks at them from several points of view, silently absorbing. Sun shining
                gloriously, blue sky with light clouds here &amp; there. I won't attempt to convey
                my impressions of the Falls. Only that I was quite unprepared for their delicate
                &amp; exquisite beauty. The effects of the wreathing spray were beyond description
                &amp; unique. In coming to America I was indifferent whether I saw Niagara or not.
                    Now<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00889.jpg" type="recto"/> I am very
                thankful that I have seen it. But I did not care to stop too long, as "I only hold a
                pint," &amp; we came away while the impression was still fresh. We had a good dinner
                at the Depot, &amp; then put in the time till train came in—Dr.<ptr target="n0119"/> reading, I scribbling. Then a 4 hours run to
                London—country beautiful all the time—"Blue Ontario"<ptr target="loc.04664_n1"/> like a sapphire on our right for a time—snake
                fences, stumps of trees, homesteads, character of scenery, perfect loveliness of
                day—all of constant interest to me. Dr. visibly impatient to get home, his
                heart going out to his wife<ptr target="n4273"/> &amp; family, &amp; friends after his trip—silent
                &amp; absorbed.</p>
            <p>At last—½ an hour late—7.30 we arrived at London, &amp; stepped out
                on platform—D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> son came up, followed<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00890.jpg" type="verso"/> by two of the
                    D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> here. Conveyance in readiness &amp; at 8 oclock we
                arrived here. As we approached along the avenue a band struck up, playing by
                lamplight, the new moon shining over head. M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke
                &amp; family all waiting in the verandah. I never saw such a
                homecoming &amp; shall never forget it. Dr. moving about, shaking hands here, now
                there, &amp; exchanging greetings. Everyone manifestly glad to see him
                back—talk &amp; laughter, band playing all the time—now "Home, Sweet
                Home," now "Should Auld Acquaintance be forgot," &amp;c &amp;c.—This quite a
                long time—half an hour at least. Then the band stopped (half of them patients)
                chorus of frogs still sounding, a few words of thanks from
                Dr.—dispersal—&amp; then into the house. Tea or supper, a little talk
                &amp; bed <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00891.jpg" type="recto"/> I
                noticed that early enquiries were made about you, &amp; about Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> &amp; his wife.<ptr target="loc.04797_n8"/>—</p>
            <p>Immediately after breakfast this morning we had a drive down to town, getting back
                about 11. Since then I have loafed, written letters &amp;c.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke notices a perceptible improvement in D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> appearance, &amp; he seems to be unmistakeably better
                for his trip—How I wish <hi rend="underline">you</hi> could have one too.</p>
            <p>I wished it all the time we were out in Fairmount Park &amp; Germantown. It was so
                beautifully fine.</p><pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.00892.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>My dear old friend! My heart goes out to you more than ever now that I have seen you.
                For one thing, you remind me so much of my dear mother. And in so far as I still
                felt a distance between us you have "disillusioned" me indeed, for you seem to me
                now as near &amp; intimate as well as dear as my own Kith &amp; Kin—Nay, <hi rend="underline">dearer</hi>.</p>
            <p>If I were not so helpless &amp; stupid! I would gladly <hi rend="underline">do</hi>
                something to please you, while I am over if I only knew what.</p>
            <p>I am glad to have seen M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp;
                    Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &amp; feel that they are more my friends than
                ever. And I am very happy to know Traubel &amp; his winsome wife. God bless them both.</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.00893.jpg" type="recto"/> Well, I think I
                will stop now. I feel sleepy &amp; write stupidly, &amp; will rest a little—It
                is now 4 o'clock, &amp; at ½ past Dr. B will come here &amp; drive me round the
                grounds.</p>
            <p>Love to you, renewed and deepened, &amp; my best prayers &amp; wishes. And
                love to all.</p>
