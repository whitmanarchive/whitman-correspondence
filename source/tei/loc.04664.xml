                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>  
            </opener>
            <p>How I wish that you were here just now!&#8212;The day perfect,&#8212;clear air, warm
                sunshine, with just felt breezes&#8212;the beautiful, park-like grounds&#8212;&#38;
                the homely hospitality of your old friend,<ptr target="loc.04664_n3"/> &#38; of his wife and family.&#8212;If
                only we had a fortunatus-hat<ptr target="loc.04664_n2"/> or wishing cloak to put at your disposal, we would
                instantly waft you here.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed the journey here immensely. The novelty of the luxurious Sleeping Car
                interested me to begin with, and everything was new &#38; interesting. We<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00888.jpg" type="verso"/> turned in about
                10 oclock, &#38; both enjoyed a refreshing night's sleep. Morning clear &#38; fresh
                &#38; beautiful&#8212;the landscape &#38; farmsteads American!&#8212;Stopped for an
                hour &#38; a quarter at Buffalo, where we had breakfast. Arrived at Niagara Falls
                (Canadian side) about 11.15 &#38; had to wait for a train &#64; 3.&#8212;So, after the
                Custom House officers had examined our Baggage we took a conveyance to the Falls.
                Took long looks at them from several points of view, silently absorbing. Sun shining
                gloriously, blue sky with light clouds here &#38; there. I won't attempt to convey
                my impressions of the Falls. Only that I was quite unprepared for their delicate
                &#38; exquisite beauty. The effects of the wreathing spray were beyond description
                &#38; unique. In coming to America I was indifferent whether I saw Niagara or not.
                    Now<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00889.jpg" type="recto"/> I am very
                thankful that I have seen it. But I did not care to stop too long, as "I only hold a
                pint," &#38; we came away while the impression was still fresh. We had a good dinner
                at the Depot, &#38; then put in the time till train came in&#8212;Dr.<ptr
                    target="n0119"/> reading, I scribbling. Then a 4 hours run to
                London&#8212;country beautiful all the time&#8212;"Blue Ontario"<ptr
                    target="loc.04664_n1"/> like a sapphire on our right for a time&#8212;snake
                fences, stumps of trees, homesteads, character of scenery, perfect loveliness of
                day&#8212;all of constant interest to me. Dr. visibly impatient to get home, his
                heart going out to his wife<ptr target="n4273"/> &#38; family, &#38; friends after his trip&#8212;silent
                &#38; absorbed.</p>
            <p>At last&#8212;&#189; an hour late&#8212;7.30 we arrived at London, &#38; stepped out
                on platform&#8212;D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> son came up, followed<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00890.jpg" type="verso"/> by two of the
                    D<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> here. Conveyance in readiness &#38; at 8 oclock we
                arrived here. As we approached along the avenue a band struck up, playing by
                lamplight, the new moon shining over head. M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke
                &#38; family all waiting in the verandah. I never saw such a
                homecoming &#38; shall never forget it. Dr. moving about, shaking hands here, now
                there, &#38; exchanging greetings. Everyone manifestly glad to see him
                back&#8212;talk &#38; laughter, band playing all the time&#8212;now "Home, Sweet
                Home," now "Should Auld Acquaintance be forgot," &#38;c &#38;c.&#8212;This quite a
                long time&#8212;half an hour at least. Then the band stopped (half of them patients)
                chorus of frogs still sounding, a few words of thanks from
                Dr.&#8212;dispersal&#8212;&#38; then into the house. Tea or supper, a little talk
                &#38; bed <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00891.jpg" type="recto"/> I
                noticed that early enquiries were made about you, &#38; about Traubel<ptr
                    target="n4267"/> &#38; his wife.<ptr target="loc.04797_n8"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Immediately after breakfast this morning we had a drive down to town, getting back
                about 11. Since then I have loafed, written letters &#38;c.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Bucke notices a perceptible improvement in D<hi
                    rend="underline">rs</hi> appearance, &#38; he seems to be unmistakeably better
                for his trip&#8212;How I wish <hi rend="underline">you</hi> could have one too.</p>
            <p>I wished it all the time we were out in Fairmount Park &#38; Germantown. It was so
                beautifully fine.</p><pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.00892.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>My dear old friend! My heart goes out to you more than ever now that I have seen you.
                For one thing, you remind me so much of my dear mother. And in so far as I still
                felt a distance between us you have "disillusioned" me indeed, for you seem to me
                now as near &#38; intimate as well as dear as my own Kith &#38; Kin&#8212;Nay, <hi
                    rend="underline">dearer</hi>.</p>
            <p>If I were not so helpless &#38; stupid! I would gladly <hi rend="underline">do</hi>
                something to please you, while I am over if I only knew what.</p>
            <p>I am glad to have seen M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &#38;
                    Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38; feel that they are more my friends than
                ever. And I am very happy to know Traubel &#38; his winsome wife. God bless them both.</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.00893.jpg" type="recto"/> Well, I think I
                will stop now. I feel sleepy &#38; write stupidly, &#38; will rest a little&#8212;It
                is now 4 o'clock, &#38; at &#189; past Dr. B will come here &#38; drive me round the
                grounds.</p>
            <p>Love to you, renewed and deepened, &#38; my best prayers &#38; wishes. And
