            <p>. . . town, I see."<ptr target="wwh.00005_n1"/> I asked him if he meant George, and he said yes&#8212;he saw his name, Capt. George W. Whitman, U. S. A. in the newspaper list of hotel arrivals, at the Avenue House, two days before. I was quite dumb-foundered&#8212;went right away to the Avenue House, and searching the register, I found it was Capt. George J. Whitman, 3d Wisconsin Vol. So you see there are two Capt. George Whitmans in the Army. I was a great mind to ask to see the Wisconsin Whitman&#8212;but I didn't.</p>
            <p>I go to the Hospitals about the same as ever&#8212;the last week or so. I have been most every night to the Capitol, which has been all lit up&#8212;I should never get tired of wandering through the Senate wing at night&#8212;it is the most costly, splendid and rich-painted place in its interminable mazes (I wander around and lose myself in them) of corridors and halls, that I ever dreamed of, or thought possible to construct&#8212;The great Halls of the H[ouse] of R[epresentatives] and the Senate, are wonderful and brilliant at night&#8212;they show best then, (in some respects.) They are probably the most beautiful rooms, ornamented and gilded style, in the world.</p>
            <p>About what is called the Conscript Bill (an improper name) I hope and pray from the bottom of my heart that, if they (the Government) are indeed going on with the war, they will carry out that bill, and enrol <hi rend="italic">every man</hi> in the land&#8212;I would like to see the people embodied <hi rend="italic">en-masse</hi>&#8212;I am very sure I shall see that my name is in its place on the lists, and my body in the ranks, if they do it that way&#8212;for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will be something like our nation getting itself up in shape. The Bill however was really meant as a warning to Louis Napoleon, or any other foreign meddler. With my office-hunting, no special result yet. I cannot give up my Hospitals yet. I never before had my feelings so thoroughly and (so far) permanently absorbed, to the very roots, as by these huge swarms of dear, wounded, sick, dying boys&#8212;I get very much attached to some of them, and many of them have come to depend on seeing me, and having me sit by them a few minutes, as if for their lives.</p>
            <p>Jeff, I am very fat and hearty&#8212;I have found friends here&#8212;I met a lady in the street day before yesterday that was so much like Mat I could hardly keep from speaking to her. I guess she wondered what I stood and looked, and looked, at her so long for. She drest like Mat too, and was . . .</p>
