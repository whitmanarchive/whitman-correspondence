            <p>My best thanks to you, my dear, good old friend for your most welcome p.c. of Dec.
                    23rd<ptr target="loc.02457_n1"/> from which I was more than glad to learn that
                you were then in impr<gap reason="damage" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> health. I have also received <gap
                    reason="cut away" quantity="1" unit="chars"/> good letter from Horace Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/>
                (written on Xmas day) in which he says that Christmas Eve found you in notably good
                trim &#38; relieved from many of your discomforts of the past few months. This is
                indeed good news for me, for Mr Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> &#38; for all your
                friends here, who join me most heartily in congratulating you upon the improvement
                &#38; in the earnest hope that it may continue&#8212;</p>

                they send you their love &#38; best wishes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wallace has kindly sent me a copy of your p.c. to him.<ptr target="loc.02457_n2"/> Thanks to you,

            <p>We have had two magnificent days here, <unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium"
                    resp="#bbb">thin</unclear> frost, bright sun shine, blue skies, a slight fall of
                snow last night following a really fine sunset; luminous starlight nights. I have
                been longing for a vigorous tramp over the hills &#38; fells, to taste the "caller

                well. But alas! I am chained to the town by inexorable duty&#8212;which <hi

                folks are numerous at this time of the year&#8212;But my work has its compensations

                appreciation of the beauty, the mystery &#38; somewhat of the meaning of the shards

                see.</p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon I had a walk through our Bolton Park where, save for the
                flute-like notes of a solitary blackbird and the cheery chirrups of a few sparrows,
                an ominous silence prevailed in the blackened leafless trees; &#38; I fear that the
                six weeks' frost &#38; snow have been fatal to a great many of our woodland
                songsters.</p>
            <p>This afternoon I had an hour's skating &#38; very <choice>

                    <corr>exhilarating</corr>
                </choice> was it to glide over the ice upon which the setting sun was gleaming,
                &#38; reddening the faces of the skaters&#8212;</p>

            <p>This morning there was a dense fog &#38; Jack Frost had ornamented our windows with
                his inimitably beautiful pr<gap reason="damage" extent="one word"/>           
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02457.004.jpg" type="verso"/> &#38; hung our hedges
                &#38; trees with his white rime, transforming them into silver filagree work. The
                afternoon was beautifully fine &#38; sunny &#38; this evening the children's party I
                mentioned in a previous letter comes off. About 50 prettily dressed little boys
                &#38; girls have just had "high tea," to which they have done ample justice, &#38;
                the general jollification &#38; juvenile revelry are now at their height. There are
                games, romps, dances, bon bons, crackers, Magic Lanterns, &#38; mirthful fun of all
                sorts in which I have been participating &#38; what is better, <hi rend="underline"
                    >enjoying</hi> as much as the youngest of them!</p>
            <p>Oh that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> could come &#38; join our merry throng, as "the
                Carpenter" came to old Elkanah Dyzer's place<ptr target="loc.02457_n5"/> &#38; see
                the gladsome "gales of glee" that sweep around that room. <gap reason="damage" extent="one or two

                hear there re-echoing peals of laughter <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02457.005.jpg"
                    type="recto"/>&#38; see the joyous faces of those happy hearted children from whom I have just
                escaped in order to finish this letter to you as the mail goes tonight!</p>
            <p>With kindest regards to all the members of your household &#38; with best heart love
