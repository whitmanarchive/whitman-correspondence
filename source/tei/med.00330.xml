         <p>I<ptr target="med.00330_n100"/> have sent to you the "Galaxy"; It contains two articles, one on Whitman and one on Swinburne,<ptr target="med.00330_n2"/>&#8212;I have read both criticisms, with great satisfaction. Richard Grant White has but paid just sympathy to a true poet "Swinburne"; The criticism is a "Poem," in itself. It has the comprehensiveness, and the fearless recognition of the divine idea, or sentiment of "Love," as expressed by the Poet, he writes upon&#8212;Swinburne electrifies me. I read one verse of his "Laus Veneris," in a store, and bought the book&#8212;When critics or ordinary readers, or writers scribble him down, the Sun will cease to procreate and vitalize the earth. He is cultivated, and "passion" is his subject&#8212;"St Dorothy" is saddening, and the "Leper" oh how passionately full of piteous Love&#8212;and the "Orchard" oh! the night is all starrd by it, and earth burdend with dewy fragrancies&#8212;</p>  
            <p>There is enough beauty in your "Leaves" to make a rare book, and not cast out sensuous extravagance either. But you are wonderfully, woefully mistaken in the privileage you take of being merely savagely material, and consequently offensively vulgar&#8212; Han is much better than usual, and is continualy promising to write to her Mother.</p>
