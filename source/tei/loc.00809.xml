            <p>I am going down in front, in the midst of the Army, to-morrow morning, to be gone for about a week<ptr target="loc.00809_n1"/>&#8212;so I thought I would write you a few lines now, to let you know&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I suppose you got my letter written last Tuesday&#8212;I have not got any from home now for a number of days&#8212;I am well &amp; hearty&#8212;the young man Lewis Brown is able to be up a little on crutches&#8212;there are quite a number of sick young men, I have taken in hand, from the late arrivals, that I am sorry to leave&#8212;sick &amp; downhearted &amp; lonesome, they think so much of a friend, &amp; I get so attached to them too&#8212;but I want to go down in camp once more very much&#8212;&amp; I think I shall be back in a week&#8212;I shall spend most of my time among the sick &amp; wounded in the Camp hospitals&#8212;if I had means I should stop with them, poor boys, or go down among them periodically, dispensing what I had, as long as the war lasts, down among the worst of it&#8212;(although what are collected here in hospital, seem to me about as severe and needy cases as any after all)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I want to hear about you all,<ptr target="loc.00809_n2"/> &amp; about George &amp; how he is spending his time home&#8212;Mother, I do hope you are well &amp; in good spirits &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all, &amp; dear little California &amp; Hattie&#8212;I send them all my love&#8212;Mother, I may write to you from down in front&#8212;so good bye, dear mother, for present&#8212;</p>
