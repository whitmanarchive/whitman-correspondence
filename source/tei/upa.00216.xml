            <p>"Bumble-bees &amp; Bird Music" safe to hand this morning—does me good—makes me feel exactly as if I were with you in the flesh enjoying it       all—dear America! I never saw here—thousands—swarms of bumblebees—on the contrary they seem always in ones &amp; two—&amp; half a dozen at a time would be quite surprising. Your robin is not the <choice><orig>sam</orig><reg>same</reg></choice> as ours either &amp; is really they tell me a kind of 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="upa_nhg.00006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                thrush. Ours is the plumpest little roly poly of a bird—fat saucy, fierce &amp; bold—his breast a much brighter red too. I am wondering whether this was written from Glenfield—whether you have found a "creek" there, or are back at "Timber Creek". I had a pain too in reading it—suddenly remembered your birthday—that it was past &amp; I had not written one word—not just put my hand in yours as I would fain always do on that day. I am so very sorry. I was then (when I should have written—middle of May 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="upa_nhg.00007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                just preparing &amp; starting on my journey to the north—first to Redear on the Yorkshire coast to stay with Percy &amp; his wife &amp; the dear little son in a cottage within a yard or two of the beach—the North Sea rolling up on broad smooth sands there, but with treacherous reefs just beyond on which there were <gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="chars"/> wrecks last winter. I enjoyed everything—the being with Norah (who is like one of my own) &amp; the dearest jolliest little man digging &amp; playing happily in the sands—&amp; the wonderful colours &amp; sweet odors of the sea—everything is <unclear resp="#no" cert="medium" reason="illegible">best</unclear> 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="upa_nhg.00008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                except the keenness of the wind which made my breathing worse—&amp; the absence of dear Per himself who was all the time busy over his fierce furnaces &amp;c in Sheffield. And now I am with Beatrice &amp; needn't tell you what a pleasure that is. She looks rather pale, but seems otherwise strong &amp; hearty, &amp; to have her heart in her work as much as ever—gaining more confidence in herself, too, which was what she most needed. Much liked by her patients—you know what a grand old place Edinburgh is amid its rugged hills &amp; the beautiful broad firth 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="upa_nhg.00010_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                of which one gets fine glimpses at the end of many of the streets. And then the wonderful grey old houses almost as high &amp; massive as the hills (but I fear, too, full of most ancient dirt, &amp; crammed with a poor, dirty, ragged looking population)—And the castle on its wooded height in the very midst—&amp; the great cavern below that runs through the city &amp; has many bridges over it. Drink is the giant evil of the city as of the north generally—Such a sensible rugged healthy looking people too! how can they give themselves up to the mean &amp; ugly demon. It must be that the scanty amount of sunshine gives a great craving for
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="upa_nhg.00009_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                the bottled fire. They seem even fonder even than we English of their dogs—take them into Church in country places &amp; here into the cars where there are generally two or three faithful shaggy fellows uneasily wriggling in &amp; out to avoid getting their poor little toes trodden on.—How about England dearest friend? Do your thoughts turn that way? I have an old friend coming for a week or two at the beginning of August—after that a sunny bed-room ready &amp; waiting for you—as long as ever you will stay with us. Love to your brother &amp; sister &amp; to Mrs. Marvin &amp; John Burroughs &amp; to Hattie &amp; Jessie &amp; most of all to yourself. If Per were here he would return your friendly message. Bees best love. I send a line of Herbs that you may see how well they are getting on without me.</p>
