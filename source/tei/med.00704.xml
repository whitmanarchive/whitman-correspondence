            <p>I return you today the proof in <hi rend="underline">pages</hi> I have considered it all very carefully and am quite settled as to the  
                    rearrangement<ptr target="med.00704_n1"/> of pages, pictures &amp;c. please leave them as I have put them—I
                have not made much change—the burial scenes <hi rend="underline">must</hi>
                face different pages as they will only be known as described in "List of
                Illustrations" by that fact—It would not do to print on back of photo-intaglio
                so I have added a leaf—the photo-intaglio will face title
                 page—the birth-house will
                    face opening of chap I (p. 13)—the "remote" and "immediate"
                "ancestry" pages I have moved as you will see—Van Velsor burial hill picture will face p. 15, and W. burial hill picture
                p. 17—Portrait 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00178.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                of father will face p. 26 (mention of his death)—every
                thing else is left as you put it. I want portrait of Mother
                to face mention of her death (towards end of chap I)—then the photograph or
                phototype of W. W. in 1880 might face the opening of chap
                ii (W. W. in 1880)—and fac-simile of writing should face page in that chap.
                where handwriting is mentioned.<ptr target="med.00704_n2"/> You told me McKay<!--<ptr
                    target="syr.00031_n3"/>--> could get the pictures printed in Phila at $1.80 or $2
                    p.m.<ptr target="med.00704_n3"/> have a letter from McK. in which he says
                Sherman &amp; Co would charge me $20. p.m. for <hi rend="underline">three</hi>,
                however, no matter, they are ordered at De Vinnes N.Y. and will be done immediately.
                I like all your emendations, additions, &amp;c so far (on the whole) very much, &amp;
                can see that you are materially improving the book, for <choice><abbr>wh</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I feel very grateful—But dear Walt be very careful like a good fellow with chap iii of part ii<ptr target="med.00704_n4"/>—whatever you do<choice>

                </choice> slash it up if you make material changes send me the M.S. with proofs that I may see
                exactly what they are and consider them—don't fail me in this—that chap
                is the pivot on which the Book turns</p>
