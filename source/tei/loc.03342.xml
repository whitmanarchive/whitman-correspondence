            <p>On almost every American mail-day I think of writing to you, but I have a bad habit of putting off things&#8212;as you know, &#38; 
                week after week slips by &#38; accuses my long silence. This remissness is very much of a part with the rest of my story of late. 
                I seem to have done nothing but vegetate, &#38; think of the fine fruition that there may be to come. However, it is good to 
                vegetate too at times.</p>
            <p>Since writing last, I have moved still higher up Hampstead Heath, &#38; am now at the very top of everything, with fine old trees &#38; 
                gardens all around &#38; the northern part of the Heath leading on to a wide sweep of open country beyond, making a characteristic view
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03342.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
           of the English kind, quite unlike anything that I saw in America. As for the Heath itself, it has a comparative wildness for a place 
            so near London, &#38; makes a capital background for a holiday crowd such as comes up here on Easter Monday, when penny shows &#38; 
            all sorts of nonsense flourish amain.</p>
            <p>Cold winds have rather kept back the spring in the last week or two, but now the trees are getting fairly green. Opposite my window 
                the birds kick up a great row in the branches, as they discuss the delicate question of mating &#38; nesting &#38; teaching the 
                youngsters the social proprieties. Happy little rascals, that have not to write&#8212;write&#8212;write, for a living.</p>
            <p>By the way, have you seen Havelock Ellis's book,&#8212;"The New Spirit,"<ptr target="loc.03342_n2"/>  in which you figure very notably? 
                No doubt the writer (who is a good friend of mine, &#38; an original fellow) has sent you a copy. If he has not, I must send you 
                one.&#8212;I'm afraid I must stop here to-day</p>
            <p>I<ptr target="loc.03342_n1"/> will write again soon&#8212;in time for your approaching birthday.</p>
