                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman.</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>Yours of 11 Jan.<ptr target="syr.00054_n1"/> received. It is a bother about that
                draft—as I think probably it has been cashed already, and that you won't get
                the money.<ptr target="tex.00476_n2"/> However, please send a line saying what
                happens. The original was posted about the 25th May last (I may have a note of exact
                date somewhere, but am away from home just now). I got no answer from you, but news
                came about that time that you were much out of sorts, and then later appeared a
                paragraph in the papers from you saying you had been ill and thanking friends for
                birthday letters remaining unanswered—so I supposed it was all right. If the
                original letter has merely been lost, the duplicate draft will of course be cashed:
                but if it has been, as I guess, intercepted, there is no practical remedy. I am
                almost certain that I registered the letter, which perhaps is an unwise thing to do
                in these cases, as it's like showing one's hand—and I may have the p.o.
                receipt for the letter at home, but of that I am not sure. Anyhow, let me know by
                p.c. how matters stand, but don't worry about it—as the letter (if necessary)
                would have to be traced from this end. The sum in question was from the Miss
                Fords,<ptr target="loc.01238_n2"/> R.D. Roberts,<ptr target="syr.00054_n2"/> W.
                Thompson and friends,<ptr target="n3025"/> Frank Deas,<ptr target="syr.00054_n3"/> and
                myself:—as a little birthday remembrance—and we shall only be sorry at
                your receipt of it having been so delayed.</p>
            <p>I saw Ernest Rhys<ptr target="n4152"/> a day or two back in London—seems pretty
                well—told me a good bit about you. I am glad from this present letter that you
                seem a bit better, Walt. Shall be glad to see the 900-pounder edition!<ptr target="n4188"/>
                a fine literary cannonball.</p>
            <p>The Fords' address is Adel Grange, near Leeds.</p>
            <p>I am lecturing around a bit, in London and neighborhood, enjoying life well—a
                wonderful feeling of new social life in the air—though the days are foggy and
                we see no sun.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Greetings to Henry<ptr target="syr.00054_n4"/> and to yourself.</salute>
