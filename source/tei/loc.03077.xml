                <salute>Dear Friend:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Thank you very much for yr flattering suggestion anent writing on the Dutch <unclear
                    reason="illegible" resp="#bbb" cert="high">outflashings</unclear> &#38;c. I sh-
                be glad of the points fr you any time, &#38; think they wd be the only part of value.
                But I agree with you as to letting one's thought drop mellow from the bough of the
                wind; &#38; I must say that I have as yet but vague&#61;shimmering ideas or
                sense&#61;perceptions as to WW.'s Dutch aspects. But I shall look up Motley &#38;
                Manahattan &#38;c, when I can, &#38; perhaps something of value may emerge.</p>

            <p>Logan Smith<ptr target="n6122"/> is a good fellow.</p>

            <p>Don't see Baxter<ptr target="n6000"/> somehow. He is a very secretive mystifying
                man,&#8212;is good Baxy.</p>

            <p>The women are irrupting into journalism &#38; crowding out the men here in
                Boston.</p>

            <p>It seems nice to think of that good comb&#61;honey of your'n. I have put up in glass
                60 jars of currants &#38; huckleberries &#38; have bought today 24 cans of Golden
                Gate peaches (the best &#8212;delicious). I <hi rend="underline">must have</hi>
                fruit, or I suffer much.</p>

            <p>It is raining this evening&#8212;a good aeonian drench&#8212;dreamy &#38; misty &#38;
                dim&#8212;we have a sweet young girl<ptr target="n5000"/> visiting us, fresh &#38; pure &#38; happy.</p>

            <p>I was quite amused to see my letter about the G.A.R. in the Camden paper<ptr target="loc.03077_n1"/>&#8212;not
                amused I mean but willing. I never wrote anything, as Ruskin<ptr target="n3013"/> says, that all the
                world are not welcome to read.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03077.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I tho't the most profound and suggestive thought on yr recent article was that about
                the need of a reconstruction of our ideas of beauty.<ptr target="loc.03077_n2"/> I shall ponder that.</p>

            <p>I find they have Symonds's<ptr target="n0615"/> new vol.<ptr target="loc.03077_n3"/>
                at the Athenaeum now, &#38; I am going to watch for it every day until I get it,
                tho' mind you, I dont expect to be anything but dissatisfied and supercilious over
                it.</p>
