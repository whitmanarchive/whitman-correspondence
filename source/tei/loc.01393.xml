                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>On coming up from a Saturday 15 Monday visit to Logan<ptr target=" loc.01350_n3"/> at Oxford, I have found the
                delightful surprise of a letter from thee dated January 22nd<ptr target="loc.01393_n1"/> The enclosures, too, I
                have much enjoyed, &#38; I am sending one of the proofs to Logan, with thy letter to
                read &#38; return. We were talking a great deal</p>


            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01393.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>about thee yesterday. There are a great many of the "coming men" there who are deeply
                influenced by "Leaves of Grass" &#38; who find in the curious English mingling of
                tradition &#38; freedom, history &#38; change, the most appropriate setting to thy
                lines of Thought. Probably it is only the stress of urgent national crises, such as
                a war, or of equally urgent national reforms, of which there are many now</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01393.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>talked about here, that make the masses of men really think freely &#38; generously
                &#38; act unselfishly&#8212;</p>

            <p>As thee says&#8212;"all goes in well in the United States"&#8212;and though one
                cannot wish for any lack of prosperity, seeing what miseries it entails upon the
                poor &#38; defenceless, yet one realizes that it is not, as yet, the best condition
                for the appreciation of higher things. From another point of view,</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01393.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>in which perhpas thee will not agree with me, I think the "Saints" were quite right
                in attempting to free the spirit by torturing the body!</p>

            <p>Our chief political interest now is in watching, &#38; assisting as far as we can,
                the spread of "Socialism"&#8212;It seems to be permeating everything. I cannot now
                imagine what life would be like with no interest in politics! And yet I used to be
                very happy in Germantown!</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01393.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>We had a more interesting visit to Logan. He is very busy, outside his College work,
                with a "Social Science Club", also with an attempt to reduce the excessive expenses
                of Oxford, which make it impossible for any poor men to get educated there. As rich
                people have evidently no monopoly of brains, it is a great pity that all this
                splendid training is accessible only to them. Some day a Royal Commission or
                something like will thoroughly</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01393.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>expose the manifold inequities of that most delightful of all
                Universities&#8212;&#38; perhaps things will be changed then&#8212;We spent all our
                Sunday discussing the desirable reforms of Oxford, but in spite of that we shall go
                again to visit it, even in its unregeneate state, as soon as we possibly can.
                Rukh-mabai<ptr target="n5000"/>, my Indian friend was with us&#8212;her first visit to Oxford, and she
                was tremendously interested in it.</p>

            <p>I am sitting in the nursery to write, and the exigencies of the</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01393.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>situation make it very difficult to pursue a connected train of thought. Ray<ptr target="n3137"/> is
                ramping about with a huge stuffed monkey of belligerent tendencies, who beats us all
                unmercifully when Ray brandishes him in her arms. Karin<ptr target="n5000"/> is babbling on the floor,
                playing with blocks, &#38; both nurses are adding a not insignificant share to the
                general babel. Outside there is a peculiarly disagreeable fog&#8212;next door
                similar sounds from the nursery can be faintly heard through the walls, &#38; I</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01393.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>grow appalled to think of the awful volume of sound that daily arises from all the
                nurseries in London!</p>

            <p>This is a most unsatisfactory letter&#8212;but I feel as if the fog had got into my
                head. We are to have here tonight a meeting of the Westminster Women's Liberal
                Association. I am to take the chair, but I haven't yet thought of the necessary
                speech. I must begin now&#8212;so I will close this letter as I began it, with many
                many thanks for thy kind and most interesting letter.</p>
