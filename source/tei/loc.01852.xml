            <p>In the fields most things prosper <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">still</unclear>. The same tenant, a father and grown up son who have made our corn and wheat for several years, are now "laying by" or giving their crop its final working&#8212;the wheat is waiting for the coming of the "travelling" thresher, and is much injured by rust. We are having all summer frequent but very light rains. Cotton is healthy but very small&#8212;I think because of so little hot sunshine.
