      </opener>

      <p>I am sitting in my room waiting for the doctor—Mother, you are in my mind most of the
        time—I do hope as I write this you are feeling better—dear mother, do not get
        discouraged—there is so much in keeping good heart, (if one only can)—I think
        that is what has kept me up, &amp; is bringing me through—I think I am still on the
        gain, though it is very slow—my breakfast is brought up yet, has been this
        morning—I don't go out till about noon—then I <hi rend="italic">hitch</hi> over
        to the office, &amp; stay there for a couple of hours—then I hitch out &amp; get in
        the cars &amp; take quite a long ride, (sometimes jolting pretty lively, as the track is
        bad—but I don't mind it much)—I don't eat any dinner, only a light lunch, as I
        find it is much better for me—I certainly don't get behindhand any, that's pretty
        clear, &amp; I count on time bringing me all right—the only thing I think of now is
        you, dear mother, &amp; about your getting well and strong as usual—</p>

      <p>I got your letter yesterday (Thursday)—I suppose you got mine yesterday—I sent
        Hattie<ptr target="n0706"/> a late "Graphic,"<ptr target="yal.00417_n1"/> &amp; one to Han<ptr target="n0285"/>
        also—(the same as the last one I sent to you)—</p>

      <p>It is singular how much nervous disease there is—and many cases of paralysis &amp;
        apoplexy—I think there is something in the air, for a year past, last summer,
        especially—Fortunately, it seems as if most people got over it—</p>

      <p rend="right">Friday afternoon—1 oclock </p>

      <p>I am over at the office—Have got a letter from Sister Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> written Thursday
          morning,<ptr target="yal.00417_n2"/> which gives me great relief, as it says that Sunday
        was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now—Dear, dear mother, I hope you
        are still getting better—you must try to feel good courage—I shall come on soon,
        probably about the 1st of June—</p>

      <p>I have got a letter from John Burroughs this morning<ptr target="yal.00417_n3"/>—he
        &amp; wife are both a little homesick, for Washington—they had got a nice home
        here—but he is going to sell it—&amp; settle up there—he does better
        there—but he was doing well enough here, &amp; was very comfortable—My head
        troubles me to-day, but I am over here at my desk, at office—Mother, if convenient
        write me a line Sunday, so I will get it Monday—</p>

        <p>Lou writes a very good, feeling, letter, about you—was very unhappy Sunday<ptr target="yal.00417_n4"/>—</p>
