            </opener>

            <p>I was very glad to have your postcard two or three days ago, + to find that you still
                struggle on so bravely. When your card came, I was staying awhile at a pleasant farm
                near the little town of Brecon, whither I went for the Welsh Eisteddfod. (I send
                paper by this poet, with article of mine giving brief description). Harvest was in
                full swing while I was there, and I had a capital time of it, riding<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03339.002.jpg" type="verso"/> about on a sturdy +
                quick little mare, + getting well sun-burnt. My work&#8212;editing +c., made me come
                away at last sooner than I wished to. I left there on Monday,&#8212;travelling by
                farmer's gig + train, + then afoot for twelve miles by a good country road through a
                quiet + picturesque <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="5"
                    extent="two words"/> valley,&#8212;so reaching this place, Carmarthen, where I
                stay with my grandfather + mother.</p>


            <p>Wales has been at its best for the last three of four weeks&#8212;splendid harvest
                sunshine day after day; + you may think of me, if you will, as living a free + easy
                life in the sun, having for society the hearty + simple farm folk of South Wales,
                listening with<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03339.003.jpg" type="recto"/> immense
                zest to their folk-songs + folk-tales, which are of a kind that you would like +
                take to heart.</p>



            <p>There is great stone of the antique in Wales, as you know; + it is good on these
                sunny autumn afternoons to climb up to some old castle, and imagine the Medieval
                bands + warriors parading there as of old. I have been dipping more + more into old
                Welsh romance + poetry of late; eking out with a dictionary my small store of the
                vernacular as now spoken. There is great wealth of metaphor, + excessive metrical
                finesse in some of these old Welsh poets. Indeed, Welsh poetry is far more intricate
                + distinctive in its way than the English, while of course<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03339.004.jpg" type="verso"/> wanting in many things that the <gap
                    reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> Elizabethans had.</p>
            <p>I expect to stay in this neighborhood for two or three weeks,&#8212;exploring some
                parts of the coast (for the sea is quite near.) + of the country, that I have not
                already come to know. Little by little Wales is becoming a fairly well-known country
                + fatherland, where many hospitable rooftrees serve as a kind of friendly barricade
                against the outer world&#8212;if it should be inclined to treat me badly at any
                time. Now defended from the sophistication of life, one can manage to live the
                spirit of "Leaves of Grass,"&#8212;a life simple + healthy + very human! But I must
                stop now, for the sun calls me out; + I have already written much to-day.</p>

                <salute>With continued love + remembrance,</salute>
