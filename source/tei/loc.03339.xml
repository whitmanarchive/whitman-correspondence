            </opener>
            <p>I was very glad to have your postcard<ptr target="loc.03339_n1"/> two or three days
                ago, &#38; to find that you still struggle on so bravely. When your card came, I was
                staying awhile at a pleasant farm near the little town of Brecon, whither I went for
                the Welsh Eisteddfod. (I send paper by this post, with article of mine giving brief
                description). Harvest was in full swing while I was there, and I had a capital time
                of it, riding<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03339.002.jpg" type="verso"/> about on
                a sturdy &#38; quick little mare, &#38; getting well sun-burnt. My
                work&#8212;editing &#38;c., made me come away at last sooner than I wished to. I
                left there on Monday,&#8212;travelling by farmer's gig &#38; train, &#38; then afoot
                for twelve miles by a good country road through a quiet &#38; picturesque cwm or
                valley,&#8212;so reaching this place, Carmarthen, where I stay with my grandfather
                &#38; mother.</p>
            <p>Wales has been at its best for the last three of four weeks&#8212;splendid harvest
                sunshine day after day; &#38; you may think of me, if you will, as living a free
                &#38; easy life in the sun, having for society the hearty &#38; simple farm folk of
                South Wales, listening with<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03339.003.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> immense zest to their folk-songs &#38; folk-tales, which are of a
                kind that you would like &#38; take to heart.</p>
            <p>There is great stone of the antique in Wales, as you know; &#38; it is good on these
                sunny autumn afternoons to climb up to some old castle, and imagine the Medieval
                bards &#38; warriors parading there as of old. I have been dipping more &#38; more
                into old Welsh romance &#38; poetry, of late; eking out with a dictionary my small
                store of the vernacular as now spoken. There is great wealth of metaphor, &#38;
                excessive metrical finesse in some of these old Welsh poets. Indeed, Welsh poetry is
                far more intricate &#38; distinctive in its way than the English, while of course<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03339.004.jpg" type="verso"/> wanting in many things
                that the best Elizabethans had.</p>
            <p>I expect to stay in this neighborhood for two or three weeks,&#8212;exploring some
                parts of the coast (for the sea is quite near.) &#38; of the country, that I have
                not already come to know. Little by little Wales is becoming a fairly well-known
                country &#38; fatherland, where many hospitable rooftrees serve as a kind of
                friendly barricade against the outer world&#8212;if it should be inclined to treat
                me badly at any time. Now defended from the sophistications of life, one can manage
                to live the spirit of "Leaves of Grass,"&#8212;a life simple &#38; healthy &#38;
                very human! But I must stop now, for the sun calls me out; &#38; I have already
                written much to-day.</p>
