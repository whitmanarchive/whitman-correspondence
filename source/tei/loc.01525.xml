        <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>It is a beautiful quiet Sunday forenoon. I am feeling first rate, &amp; have had quite a
        good day so far. After breakfast I went out &amp; sat a long while on the porch in front,
        reading the Sunday paper, enjoying the cool &amp; shade&#8212;&amp; besides some real sweet
        music&#8212;A young widow next door, a friend of mother's, has been in her parlor the last
        three hours, singing and practising&#8212;she has a voice not powerful &amp; ornamental as
        the opera ladies, but with that something, pleasing &amp; tender, that goes to the right
        spot&#8212;sings good old hymns &amp; songs&#8212;I have enjoyed it greatly&#8212;you would
        too&#8212;</p>

      <p>It is now between &#189; past 10 &amp; 11&#8212;The distant bells are slowly
        ringing&#8212;Otherwise it is pretty quiet&#8212;The last two hours I have been up here
        reading my proof. I have four or five hours of this every day, which gives me something to
        do&#8212;an employment like. </p>

      <p>Pete, I have just taken out your last letter, &amp; read it over again&#8212;I went out on
        a kind of little excursion by myself last night&#8212;all alone&#8212;It was very pleasant,
        cool enough, &amp; the moon shining&#8212;I think of you too, Pete, &amp; a great deal of
        the time&#8212;</p>

      <p rend="right">Tuesday afternoon 9th </p>

      <p>I was out yesterday a great part of the day on the river to see the yacht race<ptr
          target="loc.01525_n1"/>&#8212;over a thousand spectator boats, big, little, &amp; middle
        sized&#8212;many of them all <choice>
          <orig>drest</orig>
          <reg>dressed</reg>
        </choice> with flags, bright colored streamers &amp;c. streaming over the green waters,
        beneath the sunshine &amp; bright blue sky&#8212;a grand sight&#8212;&amp; the beautiful
        yachts &amp; pleasure boats, lots &amp; lots of them, with immense white sails, like great
        wings, tearing along in the breeze&#8212;the bay each side alive with people on the
        boats&#8212;150,000 people they say&#8212;the shores &amp; hills covered for miles
        too&#8212;I was out again last night. It was fine&#8212;</p>

      <p>Your welcome letter of the 8th has come this morning, dear loving son, &amp; has pleased
        me, as always. That accident on the bridge was indeed terrible<ptr target="loc.01525_n2"
        />&#8212;that bridge is a disgrace to Washington, any how&#8212;Pete, I wish you to tell Mr.
        &amp; Mrs. Nash<ptr target="loc.01525_n3"/> &amp; your cousin, &amp; all, I send them my
        best respects&#8212;Also Henry Hurt<ptr target="n0321"/>&#8212;also Andy Woolridge<ptr
          target="loc.01525_n4"/> on 7th st&#8212;</p>

      <p rend="right">Wednesday afternoon <lb/>10th&#8212;</p>
      <p>Dear son, yours of 9th came this forenoon&#8212;I feel quite unhappy about your bad luck
        again&#8212;reported by some damned fool, &amp; taken off by a worse damned fool&#8212;But
        you keep a good heart, Pete&#8212;school will keep some how&#8212;I have no room to write
        more at present&#8212;Dear loving son, I want to keep writing frequently. </p>

        <p><hi rend="italic">just going out</hi>&#8212;Bub, just in the nick of time before I sealed
          this letter, as I had finished dressing to go out, mother sung out to me from the foot of
          the stairs&#8212;&amp; I got your good welcome third letter. Pete, you are doing
          first-rate. I guess Pleasants<ptr target="loc.01525_n5"/> was after something stronger
          than Kissengen<ptr target="loc.01525_n6"/>&#8212;Tell Dr. Milburn<ptr
