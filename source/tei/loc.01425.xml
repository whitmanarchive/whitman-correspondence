                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>We have
                been forming here a little club, or series of meetings, for authors and writers, and
                it has seemed to several who have a good deal to do with the management of the club
                that you, although only now &#38; then in New York, ought to belong to it. I have no
                sort of doubt that at the next meeting (the 20th) you will be <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.01425.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> elected a member if you wish to
                belong. The initiation fee is fifteen dollars, the annual dues ten. Is there any
                chance of you being in town next Wednesday? If so, I could guarantee that at the
                business meeting at 8 o'clock you would be elected &#38; at nine you could come in,
                as <hi rend="underline">my guest</hi> for the Evening. For our system includes one
                guest asked by each member. Please let me hear from you at once&#8212;whether you
                would like to have your name <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01425.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> put up and also whether you will come, as guest, to the next
                meeting. The club is just organised. Thirty-eight well known &#38; less well known
                writers have been approached. 36 have accepted. Our present limit is 50, and
                probably five or ten will be elected next Wednesday. I want your name to head the
                list, not merely because of my esteem for you personally, but because of your
                importance in American letters. The club contains all the representative men who can
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01425.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> be called
                litt&#233;rateurs, the managers of the four leading reviews &#38; magazines, &#38;c,
                &#38;c, &#38; will doubtless embrace a number of the working men of letters in other
                cities. So you see the need of decision before the limit of membership is reached. I
                enclose you an odd copy of our circular call to the 38 &#38; of the summons to our
                first regular meeting, at which I sincerely hope that the "good gray" will be a
                prominent figure. Let me know soon.</p>
