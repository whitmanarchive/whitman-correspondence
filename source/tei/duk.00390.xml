            <p>Your letters &amp;c have all been received and delivered to Han. Respecting her
                neglect of writing her aged mother, not the slightest apology can be offerd. I have
                been compelled for a long time to procure <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="br">a</unclear> novel, for her "Sunday" reading—and certainly, if
                she spends Sunday this way, she can't write to her mother. It is reasonable to
                anticipate, from Mrs. Whitmans past robustness, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="br">and</unclear> present approaching infirmities, that she
                will never undergo protracted sickness, but her demise, when it does take place,
                will occur in a brief period. It may so happen that Hannah may not be permitted to
                see her mother again (although I trust that Mrs Whitman will live many

                years to come.</p>
            
            <p>I have reasoned with Han, in this way, but without avail—Han <choice>
                    <orig>realy</orig>
                    <reg>really</reg>
                </choice>
                experiences no outward sentiment or
                sympathy—This neglect <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="br">of</unclear> hers is odious to me. I have told her frankly that it is
                impossible for me to respect her, in view <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="br">of</unclear> this; coupled with her indifference, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="br">and</unclear> ingratitude in other
                cases.</p>
            <p>She drudges about the same—<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="br">"washing"</unclear> now takes place three days of the week, commencing
                Sunday morning; and her appearance would disgrace any servant in the vicinity. It
                seems impossible for me to maintain any respectable degree of order—It
                has become more than constant controversy—<choice>
                    <orig>allmost</orig>
                    <reg>almost</reg>
                </choice> a fight. She has no respect for me, nor the least consideration for the
                    <gap reason="illegible" extent="about two letters" quantity="2" unit="chars"/> bear I have performed, in endeavoring
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="br">to</unclear> accomplish an
                agreeable neat, and pretty home—I can go no further with it—We
                occupy but three rooms <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="br">of</unclear> the house, and these are badly kept.

                ; my personal washing amounts to just 4
                pieces a week, with a pair of stocking and two or three handkerchiefs.</p>
            
            <p>I have three vacant rooms—I dare not let them, at a handsome rent, or
            either use them myself professionally—</p>
            
            <p>A greater want of morals or womanly sensibility could scarcely be found and intellectual
            imbecility—</p>
            
            <p>She has been some days, and succeeds in tracing 3 lines to her
                mother, in "lead" pencil—I grow indignant and exasperated—No man
                assumes so much household responsibilities as I do, and all but for two
                persons—</p>
            
            <p>Han speaks of visiting Brooklyn. I make no objection, although it will bring no
                comfort to her mother, I <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#el">predict.</unclear></p>
            
            <p>She is too thoroughly selfish—There has been a
                proposition also for my absence—a few short months, <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> run down my place more than <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">I</unclear> would like to recover—So I
                shall rent the house—It is but a shelter since, I was sick; she deliberately turned
                the key on me, and I had to stay at my room all night—comment is
                unnecessary—</p>
