            <p>Your letters &amp;c have all been received and delivered to Han.,<ptr target="n0285"
                /> Respecting her neglect of writing her aged mother,<ptr target="n0705"/> not the
                slightest apology can be offerd. I have been compelled for a long time to procure
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">a</unclear> novel, for her
                "Sunday" reading&#8212;and certainly, if she spends Sunday this way, she can't write
                to her mother. It is reasonable to anticipate, from Mrs. Whitmans past robustness,
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">and</unclear> present
                approaching infirmities, that she will never undergo protracted sickness, but her
                demise, when it does take place, will occur in a brief period. It may so happen that
                Hannah may not be permitted to see her mother again (although I trust that Mrs
                Whitman will live many <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="duk.00390.002.jpg" type="recto"/>
                years to come.</p>

            <p>I have reasoned with Han in this way, but without avail&#8212;Han <choice>
                    <orig>realy</orig>
                    <reg>really</reg>
                </choice> experiences no outward sentiment or sympathy&#8212;This neglect <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#br">of</unclear> hers is odious to me. I
                have told her frankly that it is impossible for me to respect her, in view <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#br">of</unclear> this; coupled with her
                indifference, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#br">and</unclear>
                ingratitude in other cases.</p>
            <p>She drudges about the same&#8212;<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br"
                    >"washing"</unclear> now takes place three days of the week, commencing Sunday
                morning; and her appearance would disgrace any servant in the vicinity. It seems
                impossible for me to maintain any respectable degree of order&#8212;It has become
                more than constant controversy&#8212;<choice>

                bear I have performed, in endeavoring <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high"
                    resp="#br">to</unclear> accomplish an agreeable neat, and pretty home&#8212;I
                can go no further with it&#8212;We occupy but three rooms <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#br">of</unclear> the house, and these are
                badly kept. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="duk.00390.003.jpg" type="verso"/> ; my
                personal washing amounts to just 4 pieces a week, with a pair of stocking and two or
                three handkerchiefs.</p>

            <p>I have three vacant rooms&#8212;I dare not let them, at a handsome rent, or either
                use them myself professionally&#8212;</p>

            <p>A greater want of morals or womanly sensibility could scarcely be found and
                intellectual imbecility&#8212;</p>

            <p>She has been some days, and succeeds in tracing 3 lines to her mother, in "lead"
                pencil&#8212;I grow indignant and exasperated&#8212;No man assumes so much household
                responsibilities as I do, and all but for two persons&#8212;</p>

            <p>Han speaks of visiting Brooklyn. I make no objection, although it will bring no
                comfort to her mother, I <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#el"
                    >predict.</unclear></p>

            <p>She is too thoroughly selfish&#8212;There has been a proposition also for my
                absence&#8212;a few short months, <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"

                recover&#8212;So I shall rent the house&#8212;It is but a shelter since, I was sick;
                she deliberately turned the key on me, and I had to stay at my room all
                night&#8212;comment is unnecessary&#8212;</p>
