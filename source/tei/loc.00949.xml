               <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>Your letter was very welcome, and I<ptr target="loc.00949_n100"/> have not forgotten you one day, though I have not written you. But I have been very much occupied in thought, as well as much of my time in going daily, &amp; some days twice to see Miss Howard.<ptr target="loc.00949_n2"/> Her sister Sallie has the worst form of typhoid fever. She has been very ill for three weeks, &amp; alarmingly so for over ten days. Her mother <pb facs="loc.00949.002.jpg" type="verso"/>was sent for more than a week ago, and two doctors have come twice a day to see her for many days. I don't suppose there is any hope at all. She is wild with delirium all the time. Poor Garrie is worn, but she bears up like a hero under it, does not leave her sister night or day. I got a good nurse for them, as their nurse had to leave.</p>
            <p>It is very sad, &amp; I have not given up hoping till to-day, but she has no encouraging symptoms.<pb facs="loc.00949.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            </p>
            <p>I was so glad to hear that your little pet was better, and that your mother had got home! Has the little girl continued to improve? I hope so.</p>
            <p>It was good too, to hear that your mother was so well, &amp; George, &amp; all of you.</p>
            <p>I hope you are all well now. I trust the little girl is picking up fast.</p>
            <p>You ask about William.<ptr target="loc.00949_n3"/> His letters have been "few and far between", four in five weeks,&#8212; but now I look a little for him to-morrow, <pb facs="loc.00949.004.jpg" type="recto"/>Saturday, and shall surely expect him on Sunday.  I guess he has had a good time, &amp; he sent the <hi rend="italic">MSS.</hi> to Curtis.  You may see him in New York to-morrow.  He will see Curtis, I suppose.</p>
            <p>When you come back what <hi rend="italic">lots</hi> of things we shall have to talk about.</p>
            <p>I saw in the Tribune of <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> the advertisement of <hi rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi>.  Glad we were to see it, Charley &amp; I.</p>
            <p>Have you sent one to Emerson?  <hi rend="italic">Do</hi>, in haste, won't you?  I <pb facs="loc.00949.005.jpg" type="verso"/>
               <pb facs="loc.00949.006.jpg" type="verso"/>want him to have one right away.</p>
            <p>Dear Walt, will you see in New York Mr. Howells?<ptr target="loc.00949_n4"/> I don't even know his address, &amp; it is necessary that I should write him a business letter. I wonder how they are. Give him my love if you see him.</p>
            <p>Jeannie is well, &amp; sends love. I am well, so is Charley, &amp; he too, sends love.<!-- <ptr target="n5" xml:id="r5"/> --> We all want to see you back.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ashton is well, but
<hi rend="italic">very busy,</hi>
&amp; looks worn.<ptr target="loc.00949_n6"/> His wife is well, &amp; I guess they will come soon.</p>
            <p>Give my love to your mother, &amp; with much love to you - hoping soon to see you.</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Yours&#8212;</salute>
