            </opener>
            <p>Brief must this missive be. You will probably receive it on or about Christmas Day &#38; I send it with my best love &#38; fervent
                wishes for a happy time! May it find you free from physical pain &#38; distress &#38; able to enjoy the society
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02536.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                of your dear friends who will come with their loving congratulations &#38; good wishes for your dear welfare.</p>
            <p>May all good attend you &#38; yours &#38; may the Best Blessings 
             of God be vouchsafed to you!</p>
            <p>I have been thinking much about you during the last few days &#38; have 
             often wondered how things were going on with you. Better on the whole I 
             fondly hope &#38; trust.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02536.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>There is nothing of much importance here to tell you about at present&#8212;things 
                are moving on much in their usual way
                &#38; most folks seem to be busy with their own concerns&#8212;I among the rest with occasional dips into books,
                which however have to occupy a very subordinate place in my life &#38; I prefer contact with the things themselves,
                after all, &#38; especially with the people.</p>
            <p>I had Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> here for 3 hours last night. 
                He is better again
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02536.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                but has not yet got into work&#8212;there is a hitch between him &#38; 
                his employers wh. however will, I think turn out
                all right in the end tho I can see that it worries him a little.</p>
            <p>Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> also came in for an hour while 
              he was here.</p>
            <p>I haste this to you in the interval between my morning &#38; 
                afternoon round of visits.</p>
            <p>Another wind storm here last night.</p>
            <closer>  
                <salute>Good day to you!</salute>
                <salute>A Merry Christmas to you!</salute>
