                        <p>In the New York <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> on January 2, 1876,
                            "Literary Chit-Chat" announced the publication of the two-volume
                            edition: "His mind, however, is as brilliant as ever, and his spirits
                            good. He is poor in purse, but not in actual want." </p>
                        <p>Gilder was identified by Professor F. DeWolfe Miller.</p>

            <p>Forgive my not writing before. Much of the time, I cannot write, from paralysis. </p>

            <p>Very soon in 1876 I issue a small edition of my complete works in two volumes. <hi
                    rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> will be one. The other, <hi rend="italic">Two
                    Rivulets</hi>, alternations of prose &#38; verse&#8212;the themes ab't as
                diverse as they can be&#8212; poetry, politics, the war, &#38;c&#8212;(I kept a
                diary from 1862 to '65, scenes in Virginia, Washington, &#38;c. the hospitals,
                camps, battles, &#38;c. here given almost verbatim.) </p>

            <p>I publish &#38; shall sell the volumes myself, for two good reasons. No established
                publisher in the country will print my books, &#38; during the last three years of
                my illness &#38; helplessness every one of the three successive book agents I have
                had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds.<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial"
                    resp="Miller"> If added evidence were needed to prove that "Walt Whitman's
                    Actual American Position," in the West Jersey <hi rend="italic">Press</hi> on
                    January 26, 1876, was written by the poet, this paragraph is significant when
                    compared with the following in the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi>: "No established
                    publishing house will yet print his books. Most of the stores will not even sell
                    them. In fact, his works have never been really published at all. Worse still;
                    for the past three years having left them in the charge of book agents in New
                    York City, who, taking advantage of the author's illness and helplessness, have,
                    three of them, one after another, successfully [and] thievishly embezzled every
                    dollar of the proceeds!" (Clifton Joseph Furness, <hi rend="italic">Walt
                        Whitman's Workshop</hi> (1928), 246). Walt Whitman referred to O'Kane,
                    Butts, and Somerby. </note>
            </p>

            <p>To sum up the situation at present: My health &#38; strength are probably
                irrecoverable&#8212;still I may endure some years yet&#8212; mind
                unaffected&#8212;spirits good&#8212;Keep up about one third of the time, prostrated
                practically or wholly the other two thirds&#8212; Pecuniary matters thin &#38;
                meagre, (but not in want)&#8212;shall probably reside steadily here in Camden. </p>
