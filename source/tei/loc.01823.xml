                <p>I can't come down so I transcribe and send to you the enclosed dithyramb which
                    forms nearly the whole of a letter I got from Mrs. Whitman this morning. She
                    alludes to a number of passages I marked in the copy <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01823.002.jpg" type="verso"/>of the book you gave me for her. I
                    told her I would mark passages for her in the copy I meant to send on my own
                    hook, but didn't send because you gave me the book, so I marked your copy.
                    
                </p>

                <p>How shall I thank our poet for the beautiful book, and for <hi rend="underline">my</hi> name written in it by his own hand so near his own! His "cousin"
                    had not dared to ask for this. The great, the <hi rend="underline">good</hi>
                    Camerado! The lover of men! The
                    Consoler! The Interpreter! How
                    strange it seems to me <hi rend="underline">now</hi> that I should have been so
                    near him without knowing him better! How many questions that I asked you about
                    him would have needed no answer, if I had but have read his book <hi rend="underline">then</hi> as I have read it <hi rend="underline">now</hi>.
                    
                </p>
                <p> Is it <hi rend="underline">your</hi> haunting voice as I heard it that last
                    night we were together, chanting to me that divine song of Death&#8212;that
                    "word out of the sea"&#8212;is it your voice ("O heart of love and soul of
                    fire!")
                    <!-- should this line of poetry be separate from the rest of the paragraph, as it appears in the letter? -NNK -->
                    that has lent to these poems such a mysterious rhythmic charm&#8212;such
                    majestic meanings&#8212; <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01823.004.jpg" type="verso"/> such sweet and solemn cadences?</p>
                <p>"Never more shall I escape&#8212;</p>
                <p>"Never more the reverberations."</p>

                <p>I have read all the passages you marked for me with a longing, lingering
                    delight&#8212;read them again and again, dreading to have heard the last.</p>
                <p>How he probes and searches all hearts with his "barbed tongue!" How he gives
                    expression to our most secret and presumptuous thoughts&#8212;as in the lines
                    beginning</p>
                <p> "Have you thought there could be but one Supreme?"<lb/></p>
                <p> &#8212;I have many things to say to you about these <hi rend="underline">poems</hi>; but not <hi rend="underline">now</hi>.</p>
