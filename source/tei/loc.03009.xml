                <p>I have been holding yr card<ptr target="loc.03009_n1"/> announcing the death of W<hi rend="underline">m</hi>
                    D. O'C<ptr target="n2002"/> in my hand at arm's length for several minutes
                    trying to realize its import. Death always comes as a shock &#38; surprise. But a
                    man with so intense a hold on life&#8212;so <hi rend="underline">alive</hi> in
                    every atom of him&#8212;well&#8212;I draw a long sigh, and like you I suppose,
                    gather what is left of me together in resignation&#8212;reluctant acquiesence in
                    the order of the universe.</p>
                <p>My regret is keen that I did not meet our noble &#38; brilliant friend.</p>
                <p>I hope that you will not succumb to this blow, but feel that the rest of yr
                    friends are at yr side. How can we really believe in death? It is in yr
                    writings, &#38; there alone that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have found the deepest
                    glimpses into death-realm. You have made it life-realm to me&#8212;given me an
                    idea of it grand in mystic possibilities.</p>

                <p>What I wrote last night perhaps had better not have been written. In yr deep
                    grief silence wd have been better. I wish you know the depth of my own feeling
                    the tumultuous emotional depths&#8212;sort of despair&#8212;stirred up always by
                    death. And I wish I cd. make you feel how all day I have grieved &#38;
                    meditated.</p> 
                <p>As you cannot go out, let me try to give you a <hi rend="underline">picture</hi>
                    as setting for this day's solemn (Sunday) meditation (with me) on the sacred
                    theme of comrades life &#38; death. My days are passed in the harrowing uproar of a
                    great printing estab. &#38; it is hard for me to find a soul-hour.</p>
                <p>I rose early, went down into the little parlor&#8212;neat as wax&#8212;&#38; looked
                    over our dead friend's "Hamlet's Note-Book,"<ptr target="loc.03009_n2"/> and especially a long six page
                    brilliant letter fr. him to me anent the Shaksp. controversy, the Elizabethan Age &#38;c.
                    How I prize that letter now!</p>
                <p>The dew had formed thick as rain in the night, &#38; I went out (the sweetest <hi
                        rend="circled">apple-blossom</hi> day of the year,&#8212;day) &#38; absorbed the
                    scene, the freshness, the idyllic quiet&#8212;not a sound anywhere&#8212;soft
                    warm mist hanging over <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ktl"
                        >Boston</unclear> &#38; Strawberry Hill, the latter covered with apple trees in
                    bloom. Three or four golden robins were clipping about thro' the air, singing &#38;
                    chirping. Presently over in the pines a brown thrush struck up. Nature&#8212;the
                    apparition&#8212;seemed so strong &#38; fair: was not W.<hi rend="superscript"
                        >m</hi> D. O'C dead&#8212;if one rightly regarded it&#8212;just as much in
                    harmony with <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03009.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03009.005.jpg" type="recto"/>the scene as my
                    part of the life-throbbing whole?
                    "What is good for the whole of nature is good also for a part"</p>
                <p>Then I went down thro' the fresh woods &#38; fields, fairly sheeted with blue
                        violets &#38; yellow-gleaming butter-cups, with here &#38; there a fragile columbine pouring out
                    its <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ktl">horns</unclear> of
                    perfume into the air. I usually refrain fr. picking wild-flowers; but in pensive
                    mood I this time plucked a large handful of the largest &#38;
                    deepest-colored&#8212;as for the hearse of our dear friend&#8212;to waft their
                    incense to his soul now merged in the dark Unconscious, resolved back into
                    silence and dream.</p>
                <p>I am glad he is at rest fr. his suffering, if it was to be.</p>
                <p>Can I be of any service here to Mrs O'C.<ptr target="n4137"/>?</p>
                <p>I feel well that I know but a small fraction of the friendship &#38; long years of
                    devotion bet. you &#38; him.</p>
