                <salute>My dear M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Thank you for the kind thought which sent me the newspaper containing good news of
                your health.<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> It concerns me &amp; others here very much. 
                A few days before the paper
                came I had heard for the first time—through a friend in Italy—a report
                unauthenticated that you were very seriously ill. The paragraph in the newspaper was
                therefore a relief as well as a sorrow. One's feeling about such apparent evil I
                find is very much controlled by the nature of the person to whom it befalls. Over
                &amp; under all feeling which the fact of your illness produces lies the one feeling
                (which the growth of my own way of thinking together with your poems, &amp; other
                causes have made very real &amp; strong)—that for some persons, &amp; for you
                among such persons, casual misfortune or calamity is not a supreme affair. We give
                our grief to you with the reserve that after all Walt Whitman has not been 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01493.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                really laid hold of by chance &amp; change—that after all he eludes them &amp; 
                remains altogether untouched. And if I should happen to live longer than you I believe 
                I should have the same conviction about what death could do to you. (Other persons 
                seem like pathetic little flowers who have no title to permanance of being—but 
                such an aristocratic theory of the ownership of a future life ought rather to be 
                addressed to Goethe,<ptr target="n0270"/> than to you, whose faith is larger &amp; more 
                charitable)—</p> 
            <p>The best piece of the news about you is that you are likely to be strong again, &amp;
                to continue your work. I trust <hi rend="underline">that</hi> may be so, &amp; rely
                a good deal on your previous health &amp; <choice><orig>vigour</orig><reg>vigor</reg></choice>,
                &amp; on the fact that you are 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01493.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                not of an age which ought to discourage hope of full recovery. We had been looking 
                forward with very strong satisfaction towards seeing you over among us this year. 
                That I suppose cannot now be expected: but it may come to be a fact at some later 
                time. One thing I will ask—that occasionally some friend, if not yourself, would 
                let me hear of your health—a line of writing would be enough. I think Mr. Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> 
                would be willing to take the trouble; (&amp; he would add to my gain if he would mention 
                to me the name of anything you may have published since "Democratic Vistas."<ptr target="n4122"/> I think I 
                saw some small collection of poems mentioned as having appeared at New York).</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01493.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>My wife joins with mine her love &amp; both go to you together. We are well. I have
                taken to an attempt at the making of poems since twelve months. It has always seemed
                to me more my proper work than prose, but if a sufficient experiment proves the
                reverse I shall return in a business-like fashion to prose—I mean to go on
                quietly, &amp; not print any poems for three or four years at soonest. I have just
                written an article on Victor Hugo's poetry;<ptr target="n4276"/> &amp;, when it is 
                printed, I will send it to you. There is much in common between Victor Hugo &amp; you, 
                but if I had to choose between "Leaves of Grass" &amp; "La Légende des Siècles,"<ptr target="n0350"/> 
                I should have not a moment's hesitation in throwing away "La Légende." There 
                is a certain air of self-conscious beauty or sublimity in the attitude which Victor Hugo's 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01493.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                soul assumes, that greatly impairs their effect with me. The poems, or many of them, 
                are not thoroughly simple—there is something manufactured in them—they do 
                not adhere &amp; cling quite close, &amp; become an invisible part of the reader. (But 
                I must stop this).</p>
            <p>I think within twelve months of publishing a volume of essays, &amp; intend to include 
                the Westminster one on your poems—(I shall remove from it one or two expressions 
                which may have done you wrong with some readers, &amp; which on that account I regret). 
                It happens that several of the essays will be concerned with democratic or republican 
                leaders—V. Hugo—Edgar Quinet<ptr target="n0491"/>—Lamennais<ptr target="n0727"/>—Landor<ptr target="n0353"/>—Milton<ptr target="n0415"/>—Whitman,</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01493.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Please before very long, if it is convenient, let me somehow hear of your health.</p>
