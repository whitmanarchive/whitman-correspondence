            <p>Just now received the "New York Commercial Advertiser",<ptr target="n0439"/> which was
                for some days ago preceded by your kind letter.<ptr target="loc.01906_n1"/>
                When returned to Washington, Clausen,<ptr target="n0163"/> 
                who has taken a strong and sincere attachment to you, most certainly will be willing 
                to translate the whole article verbally to you. I should be glad, if after a 
                <choice><sic>throughout</sic><corr>thorough</corr></choice> 
                knowledge you still would be pleased with it. I have had <hi rend="underline">very</hi> 
                great pleasure in introducing you to the Scandinavian public and most probably in no 
                European country you would find the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kk">questions</unclear> 
                of the mind so fa<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01906.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>vourable
                for the understanding of your poetry. Your books and portraits have in the last month 
                circulated amongst the ladies of my acquaintance, for especially it is the women that 
                are your friends. Bjornson<ptr target="n0088"/> writes of your article: "Walt Whitman 
                makes me a joy as no new man in many years and in one respect the greatest I have ever 
                had. Never had I thought in <hi rend="underline">my</hi> days (during <hi rend="underline">my</hi> 
                life-time) to get a spirit (or ghost, none of the expressions signify exactly our stand) 
                for my help&#8212;from America. But such and in no other shape of course it must come. 
                I thank him and thee from my full heart. I went amazed during some days and still the 
                great impressions are haunting me, as were I on the ocean looking on the driving

                ice-bergs, that are inaugurating the spring."</p>
            <p>I am very curious to know how you did like Clemens Petersen.<ptr target="n0780"/> Of course 
                you did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> like him. But if you have not found him broken by 
                sickness and bad humors you must have felt, that here is a mind with perhaps the finest 
                nerves for beauty, you ever met.</p>
            <p>Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on "American Fancy" 
                <choice><sic>comparating</sic><corr>comparing</corr></choice> 
                the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension in your newspapers with the humor 
                of Luther and Shakespeare. Our own papers are some times bringing such specimens of wit and 
                <choice><orig>humour</orig><reg>humor</reg></choice> extracted 
                <choice><sic>fra</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> 
                the American papers. Could you not find for me about a dozen 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01906.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                jokes of this sort. That is all I want. For instance: I saw in "Harpers Weekly"<ptr target="duk.00513_n21"/> 
                one of your leading political men (whom as Cincinnatus<ptr target="loc.01906_n2"/> 
                by the plough bringing <hi rend="underline">himself</hi> 
                an address, the same person making (in two figures) compliments to himself. Another instance: 
                A teacher explains to his pupils the meaning of a phenomenon. An apple 
                tree is no phenomena; a cow is none. But if you were seeing a cow in an apple-tree plucking 
                apples with the tail: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be a phenomenon!</p>
            <p>At present you will understand my meaning! Good by.</p>
