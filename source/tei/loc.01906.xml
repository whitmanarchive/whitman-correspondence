            <p>Just now received the New York Commercial Advertiser<!-- <ptr target="n0439"/> -->, which was
                for some days ago preceded by your kind letter. When returned to Washington,
                    Clausen<!-- <ptr target="n0163"/> -->, who has taken a strong and sincere attachment to
                you, most certainly will be willing to translate the whole article verbally to you.
                I should be glad if after a thorough knowledge you still would be pleased with it. I
                have had <hi rend="underline">very</hi> great pleasure in introducing you to the
                Scandinavian public, and most probably in no European country you would find the
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kk">questions<!--Traubel: "conditions"--></unclear> of the mind so favourable <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01906.002.jpg" type="verso"/> for the
                <!--crossed out: "your"-->understanding of your poetry. Your books and portraits
                have in the last month circulated amongst the ladies of my acquaintance, for
                especially it is the women that are your friends. Bjornson<!--annotation--> writes
                of your article: "Walt Whitman makes me a joy as no new man in many years and in one
                respect the greatest I have ever had. Never had I thought in <hi rend="underline">my</hi> days (during <hi rend="underline">my</hi> life-time) to get a spirit
                (or ghost, none of the expressions signify exactly our stand) <choice>
                    <sic>(</sic>
                    <corr/>
                </choice>for my help&#8212;from America. But such and in no other shape of course it
                must come. I thank him and thee from my full heart. I went amazed during some days
                and still the great impressions are haunting me, as were I on the ocean looking on
                the driving <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01906.003.jpg" type="recto"/> ice-bergs,
                that are inaugurating the spring."</p>

            <p>I am very curious to know how you did like Clemens Petersen<!--annotation-->. Of
                course you did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> like him. But if you have not found him
                broken by sickness and bad humors you must have felt, that here is a mind with
                perhaps the finest nerves for beauty, you ever met.</p>

            <p>Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on "American fancy"<!--annotation-->
                <choice>
                    <sic>comparating</sic>
                    <corr>comparing</corr>
                </choice> the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension in your
                newspapers with the humor of Luther and Shakespeare. Our own papers are some times
                bringing such specimens of wit and humour extracted from the American papers. Could
                you not find for me about a dozen <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01906.004.jpg" type="verso"/> jokes of this sort. That is all I want. For instance: I saw in
                "Harpers Weekly"<!-- <ptr target="n0290"/> --> one of your leading political men (whom?) as
                Cincinnatus by the plough bringing <hi rend="underline">himself</hi> an address, the
                same person making (in two figures) compliments to himself. Another instance: A
                teacher explains to his <hi rend="underline">children</hi> pupils the meaning of a
                phenomenon. An apple tree is no phenomenon; a cow is none. But if you were seeing a
                cow in an apple tree plucking apples with his tail: <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                would be a phenomenon!</p>

            <p>At present you will understand my meaning! Good bye.</p>
