                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I did not get your letter of September 27th till I was leaving for New England, and
                today I have yours of October 4th, which Nelly sends me.</p>
            <p>I felt so miserably unwell that I decided to try a vacation, and left Washington on
                the 30th of September for Providence, intending to come down at once here to the
                island of <choice>
                    <orig>Conauient</orig>
                    <reg>Conneaut</reg>
                </choice>, opposite Newport, where I now am. But a severe cold, and a week of
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#br">unsettled</unclear> and
                stormy weather delayed me in Providence till the 6th, when <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01822.002.jpg" type="verso"/> I arrived here. I intended to stay at
                the Light House on the end of the island (Beaver Tail L.H.) but the keeper could not
                accommodate me, so I am boarding with a private family.</p>

            <p>My purpose was to kill two birds with one stone&#8212;get well and fix up the
                "Carpenter", but I fear neither are likely to be effected. I feel wretchedly unwell,
                and can't think of composition. I never was so <hi rend="underline">tired</hi> in my
                life, and am so sleepy that I drop off in slumber if I sit a few minutes in a
                chair&#8212;a new experience for me. I slept twelve hours last night, and after
                dinner today (one o'clock) fell asleep in a rocking chair <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01822.011.jpg" type="recto"/> and slept till six! I never felt such
                lethargy. I expect some day I shall fall asleep like Rip Van Winkle or (more
                appropriately) the Sleeping Beauty, and my beard grow down all over the rocks like
                sea-weed, and cover the sea, and my hair spread backward over the island, and
                smother the inhabitants. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">Selah.</unclear></p>
            <p>I shall probably leave here by the first of next week. I intended to stay longer, but
                it is dull and lonely to me, not feeling able to occupy myself with writing, and the
                beauty of the sea is half-lost and indifferent to my sick eyes. My only pleasure is
                a daily delicious <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01822.012.jpg" type="verso"/> swim
                in the ocean&#8212;all too-brief, for the water is too cold to stay in
                long&#8212;but oh, how good it is! It electrifies and braces me for a few minutes,
                but then I got dull and sleepy again.</p>
            <p>So far, thanks to not feeling well, I haven't had a good time at all.</p>
            <p>Dear Walt, I hope you will come to Providence. Dr. Channing and Jeannie quite count
                upon it, and will be much gratified. I hope you will be there while I am, and then
                we can go around. I shall return there about the 12th or 13th, and if you fulfil
                your original intention, that will about bring us together at that time.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01822.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I am glad you are going to send to Freiligrath. I will do my part, eagerly, though I
                think I had better wait a few days now, hoping to feel better, and therefore in a
                better mood. Perhaps, I had better wait till I see you in Providence, if you decide
                to come on there, and then we can talk it over, and arrange just what is best to
                say.</p>
            <p>Swinton's discovery of the resemblance in form between Leaves of Grass and Blake's
                poetry, is in my humble opinion, a mare's nest of the first water. (Irish!!) The
                resemblance is extremely superficial&#8212;about as much as <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01822.008.jpg" type="verso"/> between the Gregorian chant, bellowed by
                bull-necked priests with donkey lips, and a first-class, infinitely varied,
                complex-melodied Galian opera, sung by voices half-human, half-divine. Such
                assertions as Swinton's exasperate me. All that resides in the matter is just this:
                Bishop South had translated the Hebrew prophets into verse of unequal length,
                following the original, whose metres are interior, the accords being of sense and
                not sound, and <hi rend="underline">this, as regards mere external form, Blake
                    imitated undoubtedly</hi>. The verse of Leaves of Grass has just so much
                superficial resemblance to Bishop South's translations, and the imitations of <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01822.009.jpg" type="recto"/> Blake, as results from
                their all being <hi rend="underline">unequal in length</hi>, and no more. For my
                part, I should as soon think of the form of Leaves of Grass in connexion with that
                of Southey's Thalaba, as with anything of the South-Blake pattern. It differs
                radically and palpably to the eye, to the ear, and above all to the mind, from
                anything before it.</p>
            <p>Swinton's item in the Times was good. Nelly sends it to me copied into the Star. By
                the way, I put the item into the <hi rend="underline">Star</hi> about the price paid
                for "Whispers of Heavenly Death": It made a great sensation in Washington, and your
                stock went up enormously. The <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01822.010.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <hi rend="underline">Chronicle</hi> copied it next day, or rather <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">transmogrified</unclear> it into an item
                of its own, making the amount twenty five <unclear reason="illegible">guineas</unclear> a page,
                or two hundred and fifty dollars, in which pleasing form it is going the rounds, to
                your great honor, and glory, nothing appealing to the <choice>
                    <sic>esthetic</sic>
                    <corr>aesthetic</corr>
                </choice> American mind so much as a success in dollars.</p>
            <p>I meant to have sent you the item, but forgot. I have saved it for you to see.</p>
            <p>That indescribable serpent, George Alfred Townsend, has published an abominably
                flippant and insulting article about you, <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.01822.003.jpg" type="recto"/> which I brought with me, in case we met,
                for you to see. My indignation was intense when I read it, and I don't understand
                how a man can write such things at all, much less about a person with whom he
                pretends to be on friendly terms. I think you must spear him with a look when you
                next meet him, as you did Tilton. He needs reducing to his lowest denominator.</p>
            <p>I left in such a hurry of preparation, that I did not see John Burroughs, so must
                keep your messages for him till I return.</p>
            <p>I am glad your dear mamma is in better quarters than before. It is a great thing, <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.01822.004.jpg" type="verso"/> though many might not
                think so, to be comfortably housed. Especially must it be so to one advanced in
                years, as she is. Give her my best love.</p>
            <p>It was so long before I heard from you after I had written, that I thought you must
                be out of town, and thought of commencing another letter to you with "My dear
                Romeo"!!! If you wonder "why Romeo?" I can only answer, demurely, because you may
                have been roaming.</p>
            <p>This is most beautiful!&#8212;</p>
            <p>Ashton was running the office when I left. I had a long <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.01822.005.jpg" type="recto"/> and free talk with him about that
                Pleasants<!-- <ptr target="n0479"/> --> and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">Boards</unclear>,
                in <choice>
                    <sic>connexion</sic>
                    <corr>connection</corr>
                </choice> with you, which I must tell you about when we meet. It made me feel quite
                anxious, but I guess all's right, while Ashton is there. Pleasants is a miserable
                devil. I wish I had power in that office for a little while. I'd put a spoke in the
                wheel of his vendetta<!-- What vendetta??? -->, which would carry it and him to a
                safe distance.</p>
            <p>Your letters were sent by young Rowland. I attempted to attend to it, but found that
                you had left him full directions, (so he said) which I guess you forgot.
                Nevertheless, I supervised him <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc.01822.006.jpg" type="verso"/> as long as I was there.</p>
            <p>Charley thought his letter to you must have miscarried. He waited for you an hour at
                the Fifth Avenue Hotel.</p>
            <p>I feel awfully sleepy, and am going to bed, a prospect which renders me disconsolate,
                but nature will have her way.</p>
            <p>I hope to see you in Providence.</p>
            <p>I heard that Higginson did not like my "Good Gray Poet."<!-- <ptr target="n0272"/> --> This is
                sad. He also had over the story about his reading Leaves of Grass when he was sea
                sick, &amp;c. a good thing, which he evidently thinks bears repeating. O ass of
                hell! I thank thee, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">Gurowski</unclear>, for teaching me that word!</p>
