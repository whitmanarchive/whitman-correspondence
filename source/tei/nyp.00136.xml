                  <lb/>My dear friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The package of "Reports"<ptr target="nyp.00136_n2"/> and afterwards your letter were received&#8212;I intended before this to write you and return thanks for the same&#8212;but like many other of my "good intentions," I failed in it.  I am under great obligations to you for the Reports&#8212;they furnished me with just the information I needed and you will please receive my most sincere thanks</p>
            <p>In your letter you spoke of trying to get me some other reports of a like nature  I am very greedy to get these things and shall probably show it in my letters.  Anything you can send me in the Report line will be of great use and a great favor to me</p>
            <p>Matters are going about as usual with me&#8212;the works are progressing slowly&#8212;but we are doing pretty good work  I wish you might be able to pay us a visit&#8212;I would take great pleasure in showing you what we are doing, and telling what we intend to do.</p>
            <p>I hav'nt heard from Walt for a long time, although I have written him several times.  I hope he is well and that the change of "government" will not hurt either you or him</p>
            <p>I remember with a great deal of pleasure my visit to Washington<ptr target="nyp.00136_n3"/> and hope that during the coming season I shall be enabled to see you all again&#8212;if I get East during the summer I certainly shall manage to get around to see you all</p>
            <p>I have again commenced keeping house&#8212;my wife was not so well boarding as when we are keeping house.  I think I have a good dry house this time<ptr target="nyp.00136_n4"/>&#8212;and quite convenient too&#8212;for a St. Louis house</p>
            <p>My wife is better than she was in Brooklyn but not as well as when we first came back from the east.  I hope she will get better now that she is so fixed that she can have better food than when boarding  The children are as well as ever&#8212;</p>
            <p>Please remember me to your wife and family&#8212;I hope they are well&#8212;and when you see Walt tell him we are all as usual&#8212;I remain yours very truly</p>
