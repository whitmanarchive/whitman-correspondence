            </opener>
            <p>I was very, very glad to get thy postal card<ptr target="loc.01384_n1"/> &#38; thy congratulations on the birth
                of our second little daughter,<ptr target="n6186"/> who is two months old today. We
                have just brought her back from the country, where we all had a most delightful
                Easter holiday. How thee would have enjoyed our drives! The fields &#38; lanes were
                starred with primroses &#38; daffodils, &#38; <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.01384.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>the hedges were just breaking into
                bloom. The air was fragrant &#38; warm &#38; the birds seemed intoxicated with joy
                at the return of Spring. The English country is so beautiful&#8212;it is different,
                too, from anything we can see at home. There is a mellow historical air brooding
                over everything&#8212;the old common lands, dating from Saxon times&#8212;which are
                beautiful even if they are not useful in an agricultural sense&#8212;the quaint old
                rambling villages with mossy thatched roofs, clustering <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.01384.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>about the gates of some lordly
                park, of whose castle or gabled Manor House one can catch glimpses through the
                magnificent trees&#8212;I do not say I <hi rend="underline">approve</hi> of grand
                castles &#38; dependent villages&#8212;or even of so much waste land. But I enjoy it
                even more than an Englishman could, I think, since I don't feel responsible for its
                existence.</p>
            <p>We have come back again to work, political, legal, &#38; social&#8212;&#38; of these
                three the hardest is the social. I grow <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01384.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>more disinclined every year for the
                kind of amusement which society here offers&#8212;which is not amusement at all, but
                a struggle for notoriety.</p>
            <p>Little Ray<ptr target="n3137"/> has entered the enchanted land of imagination. She
                lives in "'tories" &#38; "p'etends" &#38; we are in terror of our lives from her
                deadly assaults as a "bear-lion." She usually eats her supper in the character of an
                "efelant" with a "long nose" &#38; a "big mouff," &#38; when she wakes up in the
                night I sometimes find her transformed <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.01384.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>into a loudly purring "pussy-cat"
                or a wriggling "'nake." Her little sister is still in the mental attitude of an
                oyster&#8212;except that on occasion she can do what I believe no animal ever
                did&#8212;laugh. But that is not quite true&#8212;I can remember one animal who used
                to laugh&#8212;Antecellere&#8212;the horse I had so many years. He used to laugh
                when I fell off&#8212;sometimes he laughed so hard that he would forget to run
                away.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01384.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>There is an English friend of mothers' who has long been a disciple of thine. She is
                going to America soon &#38; is so <hi rend="underline">very</hi> anxious to see thee
                that I ventured to give her a letter to thee. But I told her of thy ill-health &#38;
                warned her that thee might not be well enough to see her&#8212;so thee will not
                    <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aa" cert="high">feel <choice><sic>in</sic><corr>it</corr></choice></unclear> necessary
                at all, if thee doesn't feel like seeing her when she comes.</p>
            <p>I am just preparing a <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01384.007_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/>speech on "Sugar Bounties"&#8212;which I am to give soon at The
                Annual Meeting of the Women's Liberal Federation.<ptr target="n6185"/> It is one of
                the burning questions of the day, &#38; is really the old contest between Free Trade
                &#38; Protection, under a new form. I am on the Free Trade side, in spite of my
                American upbringing.</p>
            <p>I must close to get this in today's post. With love &#38; always with sincerest
                wishes for thy health, I am,</p>
