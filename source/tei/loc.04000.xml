            <p>Your kind letter (Eva's) came this afternoon &amp; it gave me real comfort both to
                hear from you &amp; have such loving remembrance &amp; friendly
                invitation—Harry, dear boy, I hardly think I shall be able to come down &amp;
                be with you this Thanksgiving<ptr target="loc.04000_n2"/>—but I will come one
                of these times—Since I have got into this shanty, although I go out every day,
                I don't go any distance—havn't been away this past summer, only one short trip
                to Cape May<ptr target="loc.04000_n3"/>—My lameness increases on me—it
                probably won't be long before I shall be unable to get around at all——General
                health otherwise about the same as usual—Eva, my dear friend it would be a
                true comfort for me if it was so I could come in every few days, and you and Harry
                and I

                could be together—I am sure it would be good for me——Nothing very new in my affairs—not much sale for my books at present, or for
                the last fifteen months—Harry your Mother call'd here last Monday, but I was
                not in, was over to Germantown—I was sorry to be away—I am writing this
                up in my room—am alone most of the time—write a little most every
                day—sell a piece once in a while—Maintain good spirits and a first-rate
                appetite—My dear friends, indeed I appreciate your loving wishes &amp;
                feelings, &amp; send you mine the same, for both of you—</p>

                    whenever you can. Harry I am sorry about the neck—I think it will get
                    right &amp; heal in time</p>
