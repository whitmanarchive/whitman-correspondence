         <p>I expect you will be a little surprised to hear from me, when mother writes to you so
            often, but she has seemed so very anxious to see you lately and <choice>
               <orig>wearies</orig>
               <reg>worries</reg>
            </choice> so much about you, that I thought I would urge the matter some 
            I hope that you will come as soon as you feel you are able I have been kind of miserable this
            spring, but am feeling pretty well again, and we have no trouble housekeeping, as an
            Aunt of mine, came to pay me a visit a week before I was sick, and when I was taken
            sick, she <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_gk.01412_large.jpg" type="verso"/> very kindly
            stayed with us, and has taken all the care off my shoulders, so you will not be any
            trouble at all, come when you will. If you could only have been with us during your
            sickness I should have been glad.</p>
         <p>Mattie's sickness and death, and your trouble, has wearied mother a great deal this
            winter, and now she seems to be suffering from a nervous prostration. The doctor says it
            is not the dyspepsia, that her nerves are all out of order, she lays down sometimes
            during the day, but not often, and she is very tremulous, and discouraged about herself.
            Yesterday she seemed better, but <choice>
               <orig>to day</orig>
               <reg>today</reg>
            </choice> is quite miserable. How we all wish you were here, we think it would do her
            good</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_gk.01413_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
         <p>George and Eddie are both well. It has been cloudy all day, with light rains, and in
            fact has rained for three days, the weather is enough to make one gloomy. Walt if you
            please <choice>
               <sic>dont</sic>
               <corr>don't</corr>
            </choice> mention to mother when you write that you received this.</p>
         <p>George wanted me to urge your coming as soon as you could</p>
         <closer>
            <salute>With much love from all</salute>
            <salute>Yours</salute>
