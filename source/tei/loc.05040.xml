                Many thanks to you, my dear old friend, for your kindness in sending me the
                Philadelphia paper (with the marked paragraph) received on the 24<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                inst and the <hi rend="underline">
                    Engineering Record</hi><ptr target="loc.05040_n3"/> (containing your pithy and entirely admirable sketch of the
                career of your late brother Jefferson<ptr target="loc.04728_n3"/>) received today. Both are welcomed for
                their own sake but mainly as messengers of the glad tidings that at the time
                of their dispatch you were in better health than when you last wrote to me. I hope
                sincerely that this is so &amp; I am longing to hear a better report.
            </p>
            <p>
                I trust you have spent a truly happy Christmastide &amp; that the New Year may bring 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jm.00259.jpg" type="verso"/>
                you renewed health with every blessing &amp; vigour with every blessing &amp; "joy, shipmate joy!"<ptr target="loc.05040_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>    
                I am anticipating the publication of your forthcoming volume with pleasurable &amp;
                eager interest. Will you please be kind enough to forward <hi rend="underline">four</hi>
                copies to me (for myself JWW<ptr target="n6121"/> and two of the friends<ptr target="loc.04708_n6"/>) and I will
                remit the cash on receipt?

                We had a thoroughly enjoyable old fashioned Christmas day here—a sort of ideal
                day—a snow mantled outer world, a 
                keen frost and 
                a dry crisp atmosphere, but no sunshine—and we spent it in the orthodox fashion,
                beginning the day by listening to the Christmas Carollers singing their joyous
                songs &amp; choruses in the early morning—it was very nice to lie abed
                and hearken to the blending voices of the singers wafted in melody across the
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jm.00260.jpg" type="recto"/>
                moonlit, snow-clad street—dining at the house of a friend in the orthodox
                English style upon roast goose &amp; plum pudding with (—tell it not
                in Gath!<ptr target="loc.05040_n6"/>—) brandy
                sauce—finishing the day by a little social "party" at our house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then there has been a thaw but the temperature has again fallen to freezing
                &amp; there has been another slight fall of snow in the night. As I write the sun is shining
                fitfully on the white-roofed houses &amp; a few sparrows are pecking up the breadcrumbs
                on the outer window-sill. Poor brave, blithe-hearted, russet-coated little birdies!
                It is a hard winter for you and your tiny companions. I wonder how many of you will survive
                it to gladden our hearts &amp; to make our vernal woodlands vocal with your
                sweet melodiousness! Never mind! Cheer up! For

                One result of our Xmas gathering was a proposal to give a free dinner &amp;
                entertainment to 500 of the poor children in the "slums" of Bolton. The necessary
                money having been promised the treat will take place shortly.

            <p>
                Another treat in store for us is a Children's Party which my wife<ptr target="loc.04820_n4"/> &amp; I
                intend giving in our house, when we expect some 40 or 50 of our friends' children
                to spend the afternoon &amp; evening in games, fun &amp; such general
                jollification as the youngsters delight in. Oh! that we could have

                It will interest you to know that I have received a brief letter 
                of acknowledgment of my "Notes"<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/> &amp; of your portrait from Lord
                Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/>—in his own hand—&amp; a really splendid letter from

                as I thought you w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> be pleased to read it.
                Perhaps Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> like
                to see it, too. If you think so you might send it to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also send you copies of some verses I sent to some of my friends &amp; a
                copy of this week's <hi rend="underline">Annandale Observer</hi> containing
                a notice of my "Notes." I—like M<hi rend="underline">r</hi>
