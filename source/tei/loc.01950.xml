            <p>I received a Postal card<ptr target="n5002c"/> from you yesterday. I wrote to you a long time ago, two letters,<ptr target="n5005b"/> 
                <gap reason="torn away" extent="unk"/> both have been unanswered <choice>
                    <sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> 
                now. I was afraid you might be very sick, and unable to write, 
                and so became very anxious about you.</p>            
            <p>I am glad however that it is not so. I was to New York a couple of weeks ago, and saw Uncle George.<ptr target="loc.03675_n2"/> 
                He is still in the Stand, working for J. &amp; D.J. Ryer. He said he had written to you<ptr target="n5002d"/>

                also but without an answer. He told me he was afraid something was wrong with you so you see you are not
                forgotten. I often think of you, and how I would like to come and see you or have you to do the same to me.</p>
            <p>However if all goes well <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> July 4<hi rend="underline">th</hi>/76,

                you write, tell me all you know about the arrangements that have been made, &amp;c. if it is fair weather, tomorrow, (which is

                very doubtful) our Sunday School, together with Six others is to have a rail road Excursion to Haverstraw,
                a town about 20 miles north from here.<ptr target="loc.01950_n2"/></p>
            <p>We are all enjoying <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> good health this Summer and I wish you 
                could pick up again and come out and spend a few weeks with us, and Uncle John,<ptr target="n5001"/> who lives 
                only about a mile off. I am very sure we would all be glad to see you come. 
                Remember it is not amongst strangers but as it <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#al">were</unclear> 
                your own folks. So take courage <gap reason="torn away" extent="unk"/>

                in your next letter appoint a time when you will come, and then stick to it.</p>
