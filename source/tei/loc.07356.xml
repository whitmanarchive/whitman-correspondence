            <p>After a long day <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="4"/> this morning the
                blessed rain begins. It is falling soft and steady as I write here at my desk in my
                office and from time to time look up and out at the windows to realise &amp; enjoy
                it. How good it is after heat and dust! how lovely and soothing!</p>

            <p>Well, I have your good letter of 14th enclosing Rhys'<ptr target="loc.03310_n1"/> and
                M. J. Cummings (whoever he (or she?) may be&#8212;(melancholy <unclear

                    reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="7"/> seems to have had a bad time.</p>
            <p>Yes, I got the "Woodberry Piece" all right. These foolish, would be visions, he's
                &amp; hars<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00773.jpg" type="verso"/> will one day
                come to an end&#8212;in the mean time I do not know but they do more good than
                harm&#8212;keep things stived up (Mr Goethe's Faust God says the Devil is a good
                servant of his&#8212;that he (Satan) keeps man stived up while without such prodding
                man would go, and stay, asleep).&#8212; Real glad to hear that you are likely soon
                to write the O'C<ptr target="n2002"/> preface.</p>

            <p>Mr &amp; Mrs <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#ktl">Mysan</unclear> are
                still here&#8212;they will go I believe tomorrow&#8212;we all like them well and

            <p>The meter is jogging along slowly&#8212;we are getting the shop fitted up&#8212;there
                is a lot to do yet before we have a business established&#8212;but we still have
                confidence and we shall put the thing right though</p>
