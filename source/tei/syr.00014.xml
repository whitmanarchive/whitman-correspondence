                <salute>Dear Walt:<!--<ptr target="n2002"/>--></salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours of the 7th came duly,<!--<ptr target="syr.00014_n1"/>--> and I am very glad to get the outline of the facts in the
                Osgood matter.<!--<ptr target="upa.00201_n2"/>--> I mean to use them, for they make the case worse for Osgood &#38; Co.
                than before, inasmuch as they show that the book was published at their
                solicitation, and
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr_kc.00034_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with a knowledge of its character, and a distinct understanding that there was to be
                no excision. If you had not accepted their proposal to abandon the publication, you
                would have the best grounds for a suit against them for damages. I intend to
                excoriate them for their shameful part in this shameful transaction.</p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr_kc.00035_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I am at work on my Tribune letter,<!--<ptr target="n3077"/>--> which I hope will prove satisfactory. The
                composition is difficult for several reasons, brevity being necessary to ensure
                publication, and tact and adroitness being requisite also, in view of the general
                prejudice and bedevilment of the public on all sexual questions. Nothing is more
                melancholy than the
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00036_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                horrible omni-prevalent sophistication of people in these matters.</p>
            <p>I am glad you are to have an article in the <hi rend="underline">North American</hi>,
                and only wish it were to be longer. Anything from you in exposition of these poems
                will be valuable, but a careful, powerful, dignified, elaborately reasoned paper
                from your pen would be an
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="syr_kc.00037_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                   
                immense light and service. I read again last
                night what you wrote on this subject in your letter to Emerson<!--<ptr target="n0218"/>--> in the second
                edition.<!--<ptr target="syr.00014_n2"/>--> It is magnificent, both in matter and manner, and might well be
                reprinted.</p>
            <p>When such a thing is done as the State
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="syr_kc.00038_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Attorney has done, it is time to
                make roaring war. I mean to open the cannonade anyway, and it will go hard if
                abroad, at least, we don't hear the response of rifled ordnance from the batteries
                we planted. I charged John Burroughs before sailing to make it his business
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="syr_kc.00039_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    to fire the
                British heart on every occasion. I only wish I were not tied up as I am with this
                weary office, and work monstrous and endless, as it is.</p>
            <p>Take care of your health all you can. The season is dangerous&#8212;a late spring,
                mutable and treacherous. But the bland weather is
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="syr_kc.00040_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    near at hand.</p>
            <p>&#8212;I shall hardly need the <hi rend="underline">raison d'etre</hi> of your
                article for mine. The outrage is sufficient excuse for the ventilation. I only hope
                I can say what I want to, and get printed.</p>
