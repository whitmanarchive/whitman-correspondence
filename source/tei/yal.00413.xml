      <p>I have come over this afternoon to the office, &amp; am now writing this at my desk. I did
        not succeed in working any&#8212;was not well enough the past week&#8212;although I have not
        gone behindhand&#8212;but as I sit here this afternoon, it appears to me I shall be able to
        make a commencement next Monday&#8212;for, though feeble, I feel just now more like work
        than any time yet&#8212;We have had real blowy March weather here to&#8211;day, sudden &amp;
        fitful showers &amp; heavy clouds &amp; wind&#8212;&amp; now it is quite clear and
        pleasant&#8212;I cannot walk around yet but feel in good spirits&#8212;am pleased to feel as
        well as I do, &amp; get along as well as I do&#8212;Mother, I do not show my sickness in my
        looks, in flesh or face, except very little perhaps&#8212;</p>

      <p>I will finish to&#8211;morrow or next day&#8212;</p>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Sunday night&#8212;8 o'clock</hi>&#8212;I still feel as well as
        yesterday, &amp; have been out twice to&#8211;day, riding in the cars, &amp; walking a
        little&#8212;I get in the cars right at my door, &amp; am brought back there again&#8212;It
        has been a beautiful day&#8212;I am now sitting in my room, by the stove, but there is
        hardly need of a fire&#8212;Peter Doyle is here for a couple of hours&#8212;he is
        reading&#8212;the doctor has been in to&#8211;day&#8212;he says I am getting along very
        well&#8212;</p>

      <p rend="right">Monday afternoon <lb/>1 o'clock </p>

      <p>Mother, I am over at my desk in the office again, writing this. I have rec'd your letter
        that the money come safe. I have just written a letter to Jeff,<ptr target="yal.00413_n1"/>
        &amp; enclosed Josephine's<ptr target="yal.00413_n2"/> &amp; yours in it&#8212;I am feeling
        on the gain&#8212;but still very slowly. I am taking some medicine, to restore
        strength&#8212;yesterday was perhaps my best day&#8212;though I feel middling to-day&#8212;I
        have not sent the Graphics containing my pieces<ptr target="yal.00413_n3"/> as I have not
        had but one copy, &amp; sometimes not that&#8212;I send papers to&#8211;day&#8212;Mother,
        you write me what envelopes you want directed to any of them, &amp; I will send
        them&#8212;</p>

      <p>It is gusty here but quite pleasant&#8212;I am feeling quite comfortable, &amp; shall soon
        be walking around I feel confident&#8212;I want to come on to Camden, but wish to get a
        little more able to move around first&#8212;Love to you &amp; all, Mother dear,</p>
