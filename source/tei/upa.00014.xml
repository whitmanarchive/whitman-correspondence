      <p>Your letter is <choice>

          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice>, having been sent on to me from Washington.<ptr target="upa.00014_n1"/> My address
        still remains Solicitor's office, Treasury there. I am moving about a good deal the past
        year, &amp; shall be for the ensuing year&#8212;I am to start for northern New England,
        &amp; remain awhile<ptr target="upa.00014_n2"/>&#8212;am also arranging for a trip afterward
        to California&#8212;a journey I have had in contemplation for several years, &amp; which has
        been two or three times fixed, but postponed, during that time.</p>

      <p>I have been stopping for two months, (Feb. &amp; March,) home with my Mother<ptr target="n0705"/>, &amp; am
        writing this home. Mother is towards eighty&#8212;has had an active domestic &amp; maternal
        life&#8212;has had eight children&#8212;has brought them all up&#8212;has been healthy &amp;
        strong, always worked hard&#8212;now shows the infirmities of age (indeed rapidly advancing)
        but looks finely, &amp; is cheerful hearted&#8212;will probably soon give up her
        housekeeping &amp; go to live with one of my brothers, who is married<ptr
          target="upa.00014_n3"/>&#8212;My father died seventeen years since.</p>

      <p>Dear friend, I am quite sure that <hi rend="italic">every one</hi> of your letters has
        safely reached me&#8212;sometimes after delays &amp; circuits, (as you will now understand
        better) on account of my more &amp; more frequent
        wanderings<!-- Do we want to maintain Miller's sentiment here? <note xml:id="n4" type="editorial" resp="miller">This was a deliberate fib in order to explain his delays in replying to a woman whom he did not quite know how to handle.</note> -->&#8212;The
        letter with the photographs gave me great pleasure&#8212;&amp; was acknowledged by a letter
        I sent you<ptr target="upa.00014_n4"/>&#8212;Have you not received it?</p>

      <postscript>
        <p>Dear friend, let me warn you somewhat about myself&#8212;&amp; yourself also. You must
          not construct such an unauthorized &amp; imaginary ideal Figure, &amp; call it W. W. and
          so devotedly invest your loving nature in it. The actual W. W. is a very plain personage,
          &amp; entirely unworthy such devotion.<ptr target="upa.00014_n5"/></p>
