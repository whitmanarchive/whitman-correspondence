            <p>Yesterday was a real Jubilee day with us here, for the American 
                mail brought us a good long letter from you<ptr target="loc.02486_n1"/> with a copy of your latest 
                portrait, a paper (<hi rend="underline">Camden Post</hi>) from you and
                a good long letter &amp; a paper from Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> for all of which we now desire to
                return our warmest heartfelt thanks to you both The letters were the
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02486.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> more welcome because
                they came sooner than we expected them. 
            </p> 
            <p>That you should have taken the trouble to write to us on the morning
                after your Birthday,<ptr target="loc.02486_n2"/> when you must have been suffering from the exhaustion consequent upon
                the excitement of the previous evening, affects us very profoundly: and I am <hi rend="underline">personally</hi>
                proud of the honour of being entrusted with the privilege of facsimile-ing &amp; distributing your letter to your friends
                upon both sides of the Atlantic&#8212; 
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02486.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>
                I accept the commission with genuine pleasure but as
                I am rather busy at present I have asked a friend to copy
                the letter for me &amp; I hope to be able to send you some copies by the mail, tomorrow night.
            </p>
            <p>It was to us a matter of rejoicing that your Birthday Party was such an unqualified success
            </p>
            <p>How it must have gladdened your heart to see so many of your dear &amp; familiar friends
                around you!&#8212;Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> Dr. Longaker,<ptr target="loc.04791_n4"/> Horace

                of the many messages of congratulation and cheer which flowed to you that day none would be more welcomed
                than the "short &amp; sweet" letter from Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/>&#8212;"the boss of you all," as you call him.<ptr target="loc.02486_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>But glad as we are to hear of the success of the Party&#8212;we are more than glad to learn that it had not apparently
                had any very serious after bad effects upon <hi rend="underline">you,</hi> tho' these might not
                be apparent at the time

                of writing.
            </p>
            <p>Warry says that you <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to be better on the evening following your birthday than you
                had been for two months. We accept this as a propitious omen&#8212;coming on the first day of your
                73rd year&#8212;&amp; devoutly do we hope that this improvement, if real, may continue; that your journey, commenced thus
                auspiciously, may be favoured with every benign influence.
            </p>
            <p>God grant that this may be so, my dearest &amp; best of friends, &amp; my life's Benefactor &amp; Blessing!

            <p>My best thanks to you, too, for your kind gift of the "mask" photograph. It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> an
                <hi rend="underline">audacious</hi> thing,<ptr target="loc.02483_n5"/> but a most striking likeness &amp; altogether
                an admirable piece of work which I shall prize very highly indeed.
            </p>
            <p>I am having a facsimile made of it to give to each of the friends here. I shall send you one, too.
            </p>
            <p>I hope you liked the Birthday Letter of the friends &amp; the copy of my "Notes."<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/>
