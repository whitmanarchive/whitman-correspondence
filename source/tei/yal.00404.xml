        <salute>Dearest mother<ptr target="n0705"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I am writing this lying in bed&#8212;the doctor wishes me to keep as much in bed as
        possible&#8212;but I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to keep in, as I cannot move yet without
        great difficulty, &amp; I am liable to dizziness &amp; nausea, at times, on trying to move,
        or even sitting up&#8212;But I am certainly over the worst of it, &amp; <hi rend="italic"
          >really</hi>&#8212;though slowly&#8212;<hi rend="italic">improving</hi>. The doctor says
        there is no doubt of it&#8212;</p>

      <p>Yesterday afternoon I eat something like a meal for the first time&#8212;boiled chicken,
        &amp; some soup with bread broken up in it&#8212;relished it well&#8212;I still have many
        callers&#8212;only a few particular ones are admitted to see me&#8212;Mrs. O'Connor<ptr
          target="yal.00404_n1"/> comes &amp; a young woman named Mary Cole<ptr
          target="yal.00404_n2"/>&#8212;Mrs. Ashton has sent for me to be brought to her house, to
        be taken care of&#8212;of course I do not accept her offer&#8212;they live in grand style
        &amp; I should be more bothered than <choice>
          <orig>benefitted</orig>
          <reg>benefited</reg>
        </choice> by their refinements &amp; luxuries, servants, &amp;c<ptr target="yal.00404_n3"
        />&#8212;</p>

      <p>Mother, I want you to know truly, that I do not want for any thing&#8212;as to all the <hi
          rend="italic">little extra fixings</hi> &amp; superfluities, I never did care for them in
        health, &amp; they only annoy me in sickness&#8212;I have a good bed&#8212;a fire&#8212;as
        much grub as I wish &amp; whatever I wish&#8212;&amp; two or three good friends
        here&#8212;So I want you to not feel at all uneasy&#8212;as I write, Peter Doyle<ptr
          target="yal.00404_n4"/> is sitting by the window reading&#8212;he &amp; Charles
          Eldridge<ptr target="n0210"/> regularly come in &amp; do whatever I want, &amp; are both
          <hi rend="italic">very helpful</hi> to me&#8212;one comes day time, &amp; one
        evening&#8212;I had a good night's sleep last night&#8212;My mind is just as clear as
        ever&#8212;&amp; has been all the time&#8212;(I have not been at all down hearted
        either)&#8212;(My January pay is due me, &amp; as soon as I get up, I shall forward you your
          $20.)<ptr target="yal.00404_n5"/>
      </p>

      <p>Dear sister Lou,<ptr target="yal.00404_n6"/>
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>I have just set up &amp; had my bed made by Pete&#8212;I am already beginning to feel
