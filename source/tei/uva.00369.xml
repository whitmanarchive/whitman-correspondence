        <salute>Dear John,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have <choice>
          <orig>look'd</orig>
          <reg>looked</reg>
        </choice> over the Emerson notes<ptr target="uva.00369_n1"/>&#8212;read them all over
        once&#8212;am precluded from any thing more or giving any very deep or elaborate analysis of
        them, in connection with the Emerson question, (as my brain is in a state not allowing
        thought, argument or study)&#8212;but still I will give you my first impressions of your
        pages: </p>

      <p>In their totality, they produce a not agreeable notion of being written by one who has been
        largely grown &amp; ripened &amp; gristled by Emerson, but has at last become dissatisfied
        &amp; finnicky about him, &amp; would pitch into him, but cannot&#8212;perhaps dare
        not&#8212;and so keeps running around in a sort of circle of praises &amp; half praises,
        like a horse tied by a tether. </p>

      <p>Your Notes also seem to me (to be plain) a good deal too diffuse, &amp; too Emersony in
        themselves&#8212;I should select <hi rend="italic">about one third of the <choice>
            <orig>MS.</orig>
            <reg>Manuscript</reg>
          </choice> as first rate</hi>, (including the opening part)&#8212;My opinion is that you
        had perhaps better work it all over, &amp; leave out at least half&#8212;</p>

      <p>About the allusions to me, my off&#8211;hand thought is that my name might be brought in,
        in one or two places, as foil or suggestive comparison&#8212;<hi rend="italic">but my name
          only</hi>, without any praises or comments, (only the silently inferred ones)&#8212;to my
        friends, &amp; circle, who know the relations &amp; history between me &amp; Emerson, the
        mere mention of the name itself, in that way, will be significant&#8212;(&amp; it might give
        pungency to the sentence)<ptr target="uva.00369_n2"/>&#8212;</p>

      <p>I have had a bad time the last two weeks&#8212;head &amp; belly&#8212;&amp; I almost wonder
        I stand it so well&#8212;for I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> stand it&#8212;I go out most every
        day, a little&#8212;John Swinton<ptr target="n0611"/>, from N. Y. has been to see
        me&#8212;</p>
