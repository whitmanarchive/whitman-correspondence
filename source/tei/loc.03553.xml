            <p> Having been told so many times at my mothers knee of how she did these things when
                she was young. It will be poetry now to me to do so myself Poetry is in the Soul
                and from the Soul and it delights my Soul to do these things over again as my
                parents did them. I see many friends and many who were friends of my Father and
                Mother. It has been 12 years since last I was here and to many I am a "regular

                the road of Time. A Zeus with compelling arm pointing backwards making man and woman
                alike review the past. Or an ordinary "finger post" marked, so many miles to Then. I
                have walked a great deal since I arrived here and enjoyed them very much. The
