            <p>I came down here yesterday afternoon in the 4&#189; train.<ptr target="nyp.00408_n1"/> Mrs Stafford has been for over a week, &#38; yet is, quite ill&#8212;in bed most of the time&#8212;She lies in Deb's room&#8212;the one you used to occupy&#8212;She is pretty comfortable&#8212;is thinner, &#38; more brunette than ever&#8212;Keeps pretty cheery&#8212;Will get around I think this coming week&#8212;had a good night last night &#38; a fair forenoon to-day, (sitting up in the easy chair by the window) but is not quite so well this afternoon (it is now 3)&#8212;They have had no doctor so far&#8212;I think the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> trouble is of stomach &#38; bowel nature, deeply seated&#8212;&#38; the general <hi rend="italic">basic</hi> &#38; more or less remote trouble is being fearfully &#38; for a long time overwork'd in body &#38; worried in mind&#8212;Still, as I said, I think she will be about again in a few days<ptr target="nyp.00408_n2"/>&#8212;As at present, though a quite sick woman, nothing serious indicated&#8212;Debby<ptr target="nyp.00408_n3"/> has been home the past week, but is to go away to-night&#8212;Mr Stafford is well as usual&#8212;was up to the city with a load of straw yesterday.</p>
            
            <p><date when="1878-08-04">Sunday forenoon Aug 4</date></p>
            
            <p>I am writing this down by the pond, in the cool of the willows close by the gurgling brook&#8212;a hot walk down the lane &#38; across the big field, but the strong sun welcome to me, for all that&#8212;Here I sit (have hung my shirt on a bush to dry)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>All here just as you used to see it&#8212;only more so&#8212;more luxuriant, un-trimm'd, bushy, weedy than ever&#8212;the locust (cicada) sounds firmly to-day here&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Mrs S[tafford] down in the kitchen this morning&#8212;I rose early &#38; made the fire, &#38; assisted Ruthey<ptr target="nyp.00408_n4"/> in getting the breakfast&#8212;We had a fine meal&#8212;I made the coffee &#38; (<hi rend="italic">of course</hi>) it was good&#8212;No mail to-day &#38; I must wait to send this to-morrow&#8212;</p>

            <p>I am writing this up in Harry's &#38; my room at K[irkwood]&#8212;Mrs S is much better to-day&#8212;She is about seeing to things somewhat as usual&#8212;(A great part of her illness is some peculiar trouble, or breakage or rupture to which <hi rend="italic">women</hi> only are liable&#8212;in her case aggravated by overwork)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>It is a wet foggy forenoon&#8212;Debby went away with Jo Saturday night&#8212;George has gone up to the City with a load of sugar-corn&#8212;Harry has gone over to his work at the station&#8212;Ed to the store&#8212;Lizzie Hider<ptr target="nyp.00408_n5"/> was over here Saturday afternoon &#38; evening&#8212;Bill Peak (epileptic), the miller's son at Tomlinson's, has been arrested for purloining a lot of Camden &#38; Atlantic RR tickets&#8212;Old Mr Morgan<ptr target="nyp.00408_n6"/> has been dead six weeks&#8212;you knew that Mrs Lizzie Stafford (Ben's wife)<ptr target="nyp.00408_n7"/> was dead &#38; buried&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Shall send this over by Harry to mail after dinner&#8212;Much obliged for the designs on the block&#8212;very nice&#8212;also the letter&#8212;both arriving safe&#8212;Give my best love to your mother&#8212;tell her I am well, &#38; shall branch off somewhere (I hardly know where) for the rest of the summer, &#38; will not forget to send some written or printed sign of my whereabout, if any chances&#8212;Her letter of a week since was rec'd just as I was starting out&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I shall go up either this afternoon or to-morrow.</p>
