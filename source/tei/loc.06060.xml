                <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have your card of 17th<ptr target="loc.00758_n2"/> Have also had a letter from Mrs
                O'Connor<ptr target="n4305"/> telling me about O'C.'s<ptr target="n2002"/>
                exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O'C. It seems O'C.'s doctors
                are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is <hi rend="underline">now</hi>
                sclerosis the disease has been Sclerosis <hi rend="underline">all along</hi> and how
                the doctors could have thought otherwise (if they <hi rend="underline">did</hi> so
                think) I cannot imagine. It is pitiable to see the poor fellow at this late hour
                going for "change of air" as if that could by any possibility do any good in such a
                case. However it won't do any harm and the change may rouse him up a little for the
                time. He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the great
                thing of course is to save him all the <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_es.00235.jpg" type="verso"/>suffering (mental &amp; bodily) possible. All quiet
                here—Country all grown solid again—splendid wheeling smooth hard
                roads—cloudy weather—All well here we have just had a good
                dinner—roast turkey, bread sauce &amp; apple pie—What more could one ask
                for? We are all looking forward to seeing you here by &amp; by—if the
                    lecture<ptr target="loc.06060_n4"/> comes off Mrs B.<ptr target="loc.06060_n2"/>
                will go with me to New York after you and surely we can bring you home comfortably
                between us—I have just written to Johnston<ptr target="loc.06060_n5"/> too
                about the lecture we want to find out what they are thinking about in New York I
                guess it will be all right—they surely will not let the chance go by after
                    Phila<ptr target="loc.06060_n6"/> letting them send a good example last
                year—I wonder when they are going to mind your hospital article in the
                    Century?<ptr target="loc.06060_n3"/></p>
