            </opener>
            <p>I sent a cable message to you this aft<hi rend="underline">n</hi> asking you to send
                me another copy of the pocket book edition of L. of G.<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> and will enclose a money
                order herewith for 22s/&#8212; in payment of same.</p>
            <p>The friends who have seen my copy are very much pleased with it, and have decided to
                    present<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02173.jpg" type="verso"/> a copy to
                one of our number (Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi> J.R.C. Hutton)<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> on
                his birthday, the 25<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst.</p>
            <p>He has been a very useful member of our little Society of friends<ptr target="loc.04957_n3"/> and is very much
                liked by us. Since he joined us he has become a great admirer of yours &#38; possesses
                the ordinary edition of your works. So "the boys" have decided to celebrate his next
                birthday (and a recent appointment he has received) by presenting<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02174.jpg" type="recto"/> him with the new
                edition, &#38; I was asked at noon to wire for one so that it may come in time.</p>
            <p>You will get this letter about the same date and we should like to feel that your
                thoughts &#38; good will are with us. I have no better portrait to send, but I will
                enclose a newspaper portrait that appeared last Saturday (He sat next to me in the
                group of which we once sent you a photo) He is an old student of<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02175.jpg" type="verso"/> Browning,<ptr target="n0116"/> by whom he
                has been largely influenced, (in theology &#38; otherwise) and apart from
                opinions&#8212;is a man of fine sensibilities, brave, unaffected, quietly devout, brotherly
                and loveable&#8212;already becoming a noteable man in the town.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> met me as I came away from
                business tonight &#38; shewed me the papers &#38; copies of recent poems he had just
