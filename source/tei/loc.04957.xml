            <p>I sent a cable message to you this aft<hi rend="underline">n</hi> asking you to send
                me another copy of the pocket book edition of L. of G. and will enclose a money
                order herewith for <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="1"/> 22/&#8212; in
                payment of same.</p>


            <p>The friends who have seen my copy are very much please with it, and have decided to
                    present<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02173.jpg" type="verso"/> a copy to
                one of our number (Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi>

            <p>He has been a very useful member of our little Society of friends and is very much
                liked by us. Since he joined us he has become a great admirer of yours + possesses
                the ordinary edition of your works. So "the boys" have decided to celebrate his next
                birthday (and a recent appointment he has received) by presenting<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02174.jpg" type="recto"/> him with the new
                edition, + I was asked at noon to wire for one so that it may come in time.</p>
            <p>You will get this letter about the same date and we should like to feel that your
                thoughts + good will are with us. I have no better portrait to send, but I will
                enclose a newspaper portrait that appeared last Saturday (He sat next to me in the
                group of which we once sent you a photo) He is an old student of<pb

                has been largely influenced, (in theology + otherwise) and apart from
                opinions&#8212;is a man of fine sensibilities, <unclear reason="illegible"

                business tonight + shewed me the papers + copies of recent poems he had just
