                <salute>My Dear Old Friend and Master,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>We are wondering how your birthday found you,<ptr target="loc.04326_n4"/> how you stood the inevitable excitement
                of the day &amp; are looking anxiously for some news about you.</p>
            <p>With us the day dawned gloriously fine &amp; the sun shone resplendently the whole
                day long. It was a perfect <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02482.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> day here &amp; we hope that it was as auspicious at Camden as it
                was at Bolton</p>
            <p>In the afternoon—after arranging for our cablegram to be sent off at 5
                p.m—I went out to Anderton where I found Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> &amp;
                    Greenhalgh.<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> They had spent the morning in the
                fields with <hi rend="underline">L. of G</hi> &amp; together we all went out, &amp;,
                selecting a shady nook on a grassy bank overlooking the lake we sat down for an hour
                &amp; a half during which Wallace <gap reason="cut away" quantity="5" unit="chars"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02482.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> us what he calls
                one of his "informal talks" upon your attitude to Religion, with readings from <hi rend="underline">L. of G</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Good Bye My
                    Fancy</hi>,<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> which we both enjoyed greatly.</p>
            <p>We sat against a stone wall, beneath the shade of some wide spreading sycamores &amp;
                mountain ashes, overlooking a wide expanse of pastoral country dotted with old time,
                grey &amp; white farm houses near which the sheep &amp; cows were quietly feeding.
                On our right rose the grand outline of the rugged old Pike, grass clad to the
                top.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02482.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>In the middle distance lay the lake, to purple waters sparkling in the sunshine &amp;
                rippling in tiny white-crested wavelets to the banks.</p>
            <p>The weathercock of Rivington chapel spire caught the rays of the sun &amp; shone like
                a star.</p>
            <p>At our feet lay the white roadway &amp; the grey stone work of the low-arched bridge
                at one end of which a clump of prickly gorse flung out its golden bells.</p>
            <p>The birds sang &amp; twittered joyously in the swaying &amp; rustling trees overhead
                &amp; a gentle breeze played <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02482.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> around us, bending the blades of the new grass &amp; dappling the
                greenery with ever shifting leaf shadows.</p>
            <p>Upon the lovely landscape the sun shone with dazzling effulgence from out the
                white-cloud-flecked empyrean.</p>
            <p>To me it was a sweetly sacred hour &amp; my heart was full of the tenderest &amp;
                most hallowed thoughts of <hi rend="underline">you</hi> beloved Friend &amp;
                Benefactor &amp; the day will be ever memorable to us all.</p>

            <p>Wentworth Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> joined us at tea after which I had to
                leave them to attend to some professional work in the evening</p>
            <p>I have read most of "Good Bye" now. It arouses emotions &amp; thoughts too sacred
                &amp; solemn for expression &amp; its every line is precious to me.</p>
            <p>My heart's best love goes over the sea to you with a great &amp; tender yearning.</p>
            <p>Heaven's best blessing be yours now &amp; always!</p>
