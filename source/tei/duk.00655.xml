            <p>I suppose you got my letter last Saturday, 21st—All goes along at present the
                same old story—nothing new in the office—I shall be glad when Grant
                comes in, &amp; a new Attorney Gen'l appointed—if I weather it out till
                then—though I am well enough off, at present, &amp; probably safe—I
                don't think there is any show for Mr. Evarts<ptr target="duk.00655_n1"/> remaining here after Grant comes in—</p>

            <p>We are having a splendid spell of weather again, after the storm of Saturday
                last—To-day it is very fine—I should like to be with you on
                Thanksgiving, Thursday—I shall take dinner at my boarding house—Mrs.
                    Benedict<ptr target="duk.00655_n2"/> told me yesterday to bring any of my friends to dinner I wanted
                to—I still have the same room—I make a fire mornings, &amp; have it
                quite comfortable—</p>

            <p>Is Jeff home?<ptr target="duk.00655_n3"/> Martha must keep up good
                spirits—I have no doubt she will get all right again<ptr target="duk.00655_n4"/>—I approve
                what you advised her about the wine—it is as George said, you can't get any
                real pure port wine—I shall keep watch of the place in Western Pennsylvania I
                spoke of, &amp; if they have any genuine wine, as I was informed they would in
                January, I shall get some for Martha—</p>

            <p>Has George done any thing about the Portland av. house, yet?<ptr target="duk.00655_n5"/> Write to me all the news. Your letter came last week, &amp;
                was welcome. I am quite busy to-day—have several jobs of work in the office
                that keep me hard at it—</p>

            <p>Love to you, dearest mother—&amp; to all—</p>

            <p>I have had to scratch off my letter in a hurry, but I wanted you to have something,
                according to promise in my last. </p>
