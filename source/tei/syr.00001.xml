                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I received your letter,<ptr target="syr.00001_n1"/> &amp; the papers you so kindly
                sent me, both very welcome. The sight of the Washington papers forthwith induces a
                fit of homesickness on poor 'Suly<ptr target="n0130"/> who seems to pine for the
                place &amp; our old home there more than I do. I have got somewhat wonted here,
                &amp; then I am busy &amp; have many things to interest me, &amp; she has little or
                nothing. Then the home in <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> was of course more to her than to me; her time was all passed there &amp;
                only a part of mine. Still at times my thoughts will go back
                <!--Traubel includes what I imagine is WW's commentary while reading the letter:["God knows, John! mine do now: to you, to William, to all of them!"]-->
                &amp; hover &amp; nestle about the little home &amp; the many familiar places. I
                expect it will be a good while before Either of <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="syr.00001.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> us are weaned from <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> I am about to sell the place. The bargain can be closed whenever I come on
                which will be by Sunday I think. Then we will be quite homeless again &amp; I expect
                the wife will be unhappy enough. I hope to be in <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> on Sunday evening, or Monday morning. I was grieved dear Walt that you was
                still confined to <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> &amp; not able to go home; but your faith in your ultimate entire recovery
                is cheering.<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> I hope it may be more speedy. I look
                forward to many delightful days with you yet, after I have built me another nest up
                here by the Hudson You will come and spend weeks &amp; months with us &amp; we will
                all be happy again.<ptr target="syr.00001_n2"/>
                <!--["Oh! the good John! that was one of our dreams which never came true!"]--> The
                spring is backward here; no lilacs yet &amp; no signs of any. But the grass, the
                good green grass, is wonderful. It seems as if I never saw it so perfect before.
                This you know is a great grazing &amp; butter country, <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="syr.00001.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> &amp; the fields &amp; the spread
                of farms around are delightful to behold. They have something of the smooth, mellow,
                well kept look of the English fields, while their freshness &amp; tenderness are
                marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes daily.
                <!--["Oh God! how hungry, thirsty, that makes me for outdoors! oh John! here I am trying to dream your fields, farms, woods, skies, into my prison walls!"]-->
                Grass like this is never seen so far south on the Potomac. Yesterday I made a trip
                to Sugar loaf Mountain<ptr target="n0604"/> 15 miles below here, &amp; could see
                over nearly the whole county from its summit, &amp; could see the Catskills 50
                miles to the North, &amp; peaks that I recognized as visible from my <choice>
                    <sic>parents</sic>
                    <corr>parents'</corr>
                </choice> home in Delaware <choice><abbr>Co</abbr><expan>County</expan></choice>. 
                But the rolling succession of green fields was the most wonderful.</p>
            <p>I have plenty of time on my hands now, but do not seem able to turn it to any account
                in a literary way. I am like a cow that has lost her "cud." I can't get back my
                ruminating habit.
                <!--["He did begin once more: he began hundreds of times more!"]--> If I could only
                begin once more I think there are several pieces I could write. I have <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr.00001.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> seen my father
                make an artificial cud for a cow, but I know of no receipt by which I can compound
                an intellectual one for myself.
                <!--["Maybe John found that cud since: maybe: I rather think he has: what a man cannot get out of himself he's not likely to derive from any other quarter."]-->
                The first of my bird pieces with Scribner<ptr target="n0549"/> will not be out till
                July; when "The Birds of the Poets" will be out I have not heard.<ptr
                    target="loc.01748_n3"/></p>
            <p>I take the "Tribune"<ptr target="n0649"/> so had seen the letter about Emerson.<ptr
                    target="n1044"/> I am glad the old fellow is having a good time. Conway<ptr
