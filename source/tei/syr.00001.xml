                <salute>Dear Walt.</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received your letter, &amp; the papers you so kindly sent me, both very
                welcome<!--perhaps WW to John Burroughs, 29 April 1873-->. The sight of the
                Washington papers forthwith induces a fit of homesickness in poor
                'Suly'<!-- Editorial note? --> who seems to pine for the place and our old home
                there more than I do. I have got somewhat wonted here, &amp; then I am busy &amp;
                have many things to interest me, &amp; she has little or nothing. Then the home in <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> was of course more to her than to me; her time was all passed there &amp;
                only a part of mine. Still at times my thoughts will go
                back<!--Traubel includes what I imagine is WW's commentary while reading the letter:["God knows, John! mine do now: to you, to William, to all of them!"]-->
                &amp; hover &amp; nestle about the little home &amp; the many familiar places. I
                expect it will be a good while before either of <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr.00001.002.jpg" type="verso"/>us are weaned from <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> I am about to sell the place. The bargain can be closed whenever I come on
                which will be by Sunday I think. Then we will be quite homeless again &amp; I expect
                the wife will be unhappy enough. I hope to be in <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> on Sunday evening, or Monday morning. I was grieved dear Walt that you was
                still confined to <choice>
                    <abbr>W.</abbr>
                    <expan>Washington</expan>
                </choice> &amp; not able to go home; but your faith in your ultimate entire recovery
                is cheering. I hope it may be more speedy. I look forward to many delightful days
                with you yet, after I have built me another nest up here by the Hudson You will come
                and spend weeks &amp; months with us &amp; we will all be happy
                again.<!--["Oh! the good John! that was one of our dreams which never came true!"]-->
                The spring is backward here; no lilacs yet &amp; no signs of any. But the grass, the
                good green grass, is wonderful. It seems as if I never saw it so perfect before.
                This you know is a great grazing &amp; butter country, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr.00001.003.jpg" type="recto"/>&amp; the fields &amp; the spread of
                farms around are delightful to behold. They have something of the smooth, mellow,
                well kept look of the English fields, while their freshness &amp; tenderness are
                marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes
                daily.<!--["Oh God! how hungry, thirsty, that makes me for outdoors! oh John! here I am trying to dream your fields, farms, woods, skies, into my prison walls!"]-->
                Grass like this is never seen so far south on the Potomac. Yesterday I made a trip
                to Sugar Loaf Mountain<!-- <ptr target="n0604"/> --> 15 miles below here &amp; could see over
                nearly the whole country from its summit, &amp; could see the Catskills 50 miles to
                the North, &amp; peaks that I recognized as visible from my <choice>
                    <sic>parents</sic>
                    <corr>parents'</corr>
                </choice> home in Delaware <choice>
                    <orig>Co.</orig>
                    <reg>County</reg>
                </choice>. But the rolling succession of green fields was the most wonderful.</p>

            <p>I have plenty of time on my hands now but do not seem able to turn it to any account
                in a literary way. I am like a cow that has lost her "cud." I can't get back my
                ruminating habit.<!--["He did begin once more: he began hundreds of times more!"]-->
                If I could only begin once more I think there are several pieces I could write. I
                have <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr.00001.004.jpg" type="verso"/>seen my father
                make an artificial cud for a cow, but I know of no receipt by which I can compound
                an intellectual one for
                myself.<!--["Maybe John found that cud since: maybe: I rather think he has: what a man cannot get out of himself he's not likely to derive from any other quarter."]-->
                The first of my bird pieces with Scribner<!-- <ptr target="n0549"/> --> will not be out till
                July; when "The Birds of the Poets"<!--annotation--> will be out I have not
                heard.</p>

            <p>I take the "Tribune"<!-- <ptr target="n0649"/> --> so had seen the letter about Emerson. I am glad
                the old fellow is having a good time. Conway<!-- <ptr target="n0170"/> --> is no doubt
                happy.</p>

            <p>Wife sends much love. Hoping to see you in a few days I am</p>
