I have been away all day as this is a day that all Niggers Should be free. and haveing an invitiation out to Eat roast Turkey of course excepted it and had a verry nice time yet I think had I been in <pb facs="nyp.00226.002.jpg" type="verso"/>New York or Brooklyn that I would enjoyed My-Self much better and Shall be glad to get back there once more as a citizen for to go there on a leave of absence is only an agrivation as the time is always So Short that one cannot heardly turn before he has to come back</p>
         <p>I Suppose that you have heard that we have a new Colonel Commissioned in our regt. who is none other than Capt. McKiben Bronets Brig. Genl. And I heard that there had been a Commisson issued as Lt. Col. to Some out Sider, I don't know how true it is, Yet I think it is a Shame to run over all of our Officers that are now Priosners of War <pb facs="nyp.00226.003.jpg" type="recto"/> Who have Served and fought in the regiment Since the Orginization and for my part I Shall resign if what I hear is true. So You need not be Surprised if You hear that Your humble Servant has put in his Unconditional Surrender, and retires to Private life</p>
