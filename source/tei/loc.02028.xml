                <salute>Dear Walt:&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
                service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
                very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees on prospect I
                was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion&#8212;same that I held
                before.&#8212;I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when
                I have paid my debts and saved a little money.&#8212;I am now a citizen of
                California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down
                in the East, again, I think.&#8212;</p>
            <p>The death of William O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> though long anticipated, was a
                great shock when the news came&#8212;What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
                power was there extinguished. if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of us
                can go out like a child's carlacue in the night.<ptr target="loc.02028_n1"/> I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of
                Jordan, &amp; if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02028.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I shall be
                content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
                Thank God&#8212;I have not seen her for two years, and more.</p>
            <p>I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia &amp; Camden papers the account of your
                Seventieth Birthday dinner. I was especially touched by John Burroughs<ptr
                    target="n0129"/> letter.&#8212;I am indebted to you for many papers&#8212;Always
                glad to get them.&#8212;<gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="5"/> me
                until further notice simply Internal Revenue Agent. San Francisco. Cal. I hope you
                are fairly comfortable.&#8212;God bless you my old and long tried friend&#8212;"With
                fond affection and recollection.</p>
