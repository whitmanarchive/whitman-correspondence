                <salute>Dear Walt:&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
                service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
                very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees on prospect I
                was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present
                position&#8212;same that I held before.&#8212;I hope to resume practice in this
                state, some time in the future, when I have paid my debts and saved a little
                money.&#8212;I am now a citizen of California and hope to always remain such. I
                should not be contented to settle down in the East, again, I think.&#8212;</p>
            <p>The death of William O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> though long anticipated, was a
                great shock when the news came.&#8212;What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
                power was there extinguished, if it could be so:<ptr target="loc.02978_n1"/> but I don't believe he or any of us
                can go out like a childs carlacue in the night.<ptr target="loc.02028_n1"/> I have
                faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of Jordan, &#38; if
                we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02028.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I shall be
                content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
                Thank God&#8212;I have not seen her for two years, and more</p>
            <p>I read with much emotion in the Philadelphia &#38; Camden papers the account of your
                Seventieth Birthday dinner.<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/> I was especially touched by John Burroughs<ptr
                    target="n0129"/> letter.&#8212;I am indebted to you for many papers&#8212;Always
                glad to get them.&#8212;Address me until further notice simply Internal Revenue
                Agent. San Francisco. Cal. I hope you are fairly comfortable&#8212;God bless you my
                old and long tried friend&#8212;</p>
            <closer>

                <salute>Ever yours</salute>
