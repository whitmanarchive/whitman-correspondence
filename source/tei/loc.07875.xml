                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>For many days I have tried to write you, but the pressure is so great that I can't
                get the moment to sit down, for as yet I am the only nurse, &amp; my duties are
                constant, much of the time. If things get worse I shall have to have a man <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_as.00226_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to help me lift
                &amp; nurse William.<ptr target="n2002"/> This morning after your card came<ptr target="loc.07875_n1"/> he asked me to write &amp; tell you how very ill he is.
                The attack he had on the 18<hi rend="underline">th</hi> was less severe than the one
                a year ago on the 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi> of Jan. but he is so much worse in
                all other ways, &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_as.00227_large.jpg" type="recto"/> the lower limbs so useless that all is harder for him. He feels
                discouraged for the first time, &amp; says the outlook is very gloomy. His constant
                annoyance from the bladder trouble now is worse than all else, &amp; so far the
                Doctors have not reached it at all. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_as.00228_large.jpg" type="verso"/> If Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>
                comes in soon can he not, will he not, be able to run over &amp; call on us? I am
                sure he could advise me how to nurse &amp; care for William in the best hospital
                manner,—as yet he has not at all come to the idea that any one but me is
                needed,—&amp; I don't mean to suggest it till I <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_as.00229_large.jpg" type="verso"/> have come to the point where I <hi rend="underline">must</hi>, &amp; can't do for him, but he is very helpless
                &amp; very heavy.</p>
            <p>I try to keep my courage up, &amp; not to look ahead more than I must.</p>
            <p>William sends love, &amp; is always glad to hear. He can read but not write.</p>

                <p>At this moment he is dressed &amp; sitting up reading, but feeling very quiet,
                    &amp; very silent.</p>
