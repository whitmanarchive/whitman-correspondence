                <salute>My dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yours of April 19<ptr target="pri.00021_n1"/> both <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice>&#8212;with draft on Drexel &amp; Co. for £28.4&#8212;most acceptable. The books, according to list sent, will now be prepared, packed, &amp; sent, (together with your &amp; Mrs. Gilchrist's copies, which have been waiting) probably to London express, of which I will advise you more explicitly by letter to follow this probably within two or three days.
            </p>
            
            <p>I repeat what I have already written you&#8212;<hi rend="underline">accept all subscriptions</hi>&#8212;all will be supplied, 
                upon remittance&#8212;(I am already putting another small edition to press)<ptr target="pri.00021_n2"/>&#8212;the price will invariably be $10 the set&#8212;$5 each Vol. can be had separately, 
                or together, as wanted&#8212;Each will contain portraits &amp; my autograph. The Two, <hi rend="underline">Leaves</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Rivulets</hi> 
                comprise my complete works (the latter Vol. as you see, includes <hi rend="underline">Memoranda of the War</hi> as a constituent part.)
            </p>
            
            <p>I do not approve of Mr Conway's letter of April 4<ptr target="pri.00021_n3"/>&#8212;it was unneeded, hurtful to my case,<ptr target="pri.00021_n4"/> &amp; <choice><abbr>join'd</abbr><expan>joined</expan></choice> with his allusions to the matter in his public American correspondence, an insult 
                to Mr Buchanan, through me<ptr target="pri.00021_n5"/>&#8212;as such I decidedly resent &amp; disavow it&#8212;Every point in <choice><abbr>B's</abbr><expan>Buchanan's</expan></choice> March 11 
                letter to the <hi rend="underline">News</hi>, is well taken, &amp; <hi rend="underline">true without exception</hi>&#8212;particularly 
                all about the American critics, publishers, editors, "poets" &amp;c&#8212;even what he says about my "impoverishment" is much, 
                <hi rend="underline">much nearer the truth</hi> than Mr Conways and Lord Houghton's rose-colored illusion varnish&#8212;if Mr C. 
                instead of intellectual possessed sympathetic delicacy &amp; insight (I don't think he possesses either) he could have 
                divined better about me &amp; my affairs, not only now here in Camden, but times past in the beginning.</p>

            <p>I send my love &amp; thanks to W B Scott<ptr target="pri.00021_n6"/>&#8212;I shall try to write a line to him, to C W Reynell, to J L Warren, to A G Dew-Smith,<ptr target="pri.00021_n7"/> &amp; one or two others, soon as I can. I heartily thank my good friends of the <hi rend="underline">Secularist</hi>. 
                I am glad you printed off, &amp; <choice><abbr>furnish'd</abbr><expan>furnished</expan></choice> friends with copies of my letter of March 17&#8212;upon reading it in print, 
                I find it exactly describes the situation, &amp; my wishes&#8212;&amp; I reëndorse it&#8212;(if you have any copies spare, 
                send me two or three more in next paper you send.)
            </p>
            
            <p>The drafting on Drexel &amp; Co. the Philadelphia bankers, is perfectly convenient to me.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am feeling pretty comfortable as I write&#8212;have been out a little nearly every day for a week&#8212;some days across the river here, 
                the broad Delaware&#8212;This is one of my good mornings (it is now between 8 and 9) have finished my breakfast, coffee, 
                Graham bread &amp; mutton chop&#8212;good night's sleep, last night.&#8212;occupy myself two or three hours every day 
                when not too ill, with my <hi rend="underline">book business</hi>, letters, &amp;c&#8212;also with <hi rend="underline">the baby</hi> boy, 
                my brother's 6 months infant, very fine &amp; bright, (of course)&#8212;takes much of my time, &amp; is a delightful diversion 
                to me&#8212;the young one knows me <hi rend="underline">so well</hi>, &amp; is always happy when tended by me&#8212;</p>
            
            <closer><salute>&amp; so, 
                my dear friend, good bye for this time&#8212;&amp; God bless you &amp; yours.</salute>
