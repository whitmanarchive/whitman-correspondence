            <p>I am sorry to hear of your feeling so unwell, &amp; have thought about it probably
                more than you think&#8212;bad enough any how to feel sick or half sick, &amp;
                specially so with one that has so much depending upon her, (&amp; a pretty ambitious
                spirit too)&#8212;I thought I would write you a few lines, &amp; may-be it might
                cheer you a little&#8212;Things go on quite the same with me&#8212;a little more
                quiet than usual since I got back from Boston (I suppose you got the letter &amp;
                papers I sent you while I was there)&#8212;I had a lively time in Boston&#8212;Susan
                I wish you could have been there the evening of my lecture&#8212;it was such a
                collection of people as would have suited you, &amp; been a study&#8212;different
                from any I ever saw in my life before&#8212;fully one half were
                women&#8212;something different in all of them from the usual crowd&#8212;about 300&#8212;(I will tell you more when I see you)&#8212;</p>

            <p>As I write this part of my letter, just come up from dinner&#8212;we had a great fat
                sweet baked shad, just right&#8212;what is better once in a while for dinner than
                good fresh fish, &amp; potatoes?&#8212;(I remember you too are fond of fish
                sometimes)&#8212;shad are unusually good &amp; plenty now&#8212;I wish I could send
                you &amp; George down a couple of big fresh ones, such as I see them bringing in
                every haul, from the river&#8212;A middling fair rain here to-day &amp; last
                night&#8212;it is raining as I write&#8212;well I am glad of it, for it will do a
                power of good&#8212;our street begins to look first rate with the long rows of
                trees, five squares of them now all out in leaf&#8212;strawberries are already
                huckstered about the street&#8212;I 
                suppose <choice><abbr>bro't</abbr><reg>brought</reg></choice> from the south&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00509_large.jpg" type="recto"/><choice><abbr>Rec'd</abbr><expan>Received</expan>
                </choice> a long good letter from Mrs. Gilchrist<!--<ptr target="n0259"/>-->&#8212;I think Beatrice<!--<ptr target="n0260"/>--> must be
                regularly established as a woman physician in Edinburgh&#8212;Mrs. G. is going on
                there to visit her, &amp; for a change, as she is not yet real well&#8212;Herbert<!--<ptr target="n0262"/>--> is
                painting away &amp; I guess having a good time, with lots of company &amp; fun
                &amp;c.&#8212;I was out a few evenings ago to spend an hour or two in north Camden
                with some friends, a Quaker family, three sisters quite elderly, one (the oldest) a
                widow with a grown up son &amp; daughter&#8212;they sent for me to come to
                tea&#8212;the five live together&#8212;they are neither poor nor rich&#8212;keep no
                servant&#8212;but O such quiet, happy kind, affectionate ways&#8212;cheerful too,
                &amp; plenty of good things&#8212;but <hi rend="underline">the manners</hi> "the
                peace of heaven"&#8212;I enjoyed myself first rate just being with
                them&#8212;(besides the good things)&#8212;</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00510_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>Susan what do you hear about old Mrs. Morgan? I suppose she is needy enough, poor
                old woman, &amp; if you have a chance I should like you to send her things to the
                amount of <hi rend="underline">two dollars</hi> a month, as I told you, &amp; I will
                pay for them&#8212;(if you <choice>
                    <orig>cant</orig>
                    <reg>can't</reg>
                </choice> go yourself, may-be you can send by Debby or Patience)&#8212;</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">Evening &#189; past 8</hi>&#8212;Well I will finish my letter
                &amp; put it in the box&#8212;maybe you will get it to read Sunday&#8212;This 
                afternoon 4 to 6&#189; I took one of my usual jaunts over in the busiest parts of
                Philadelphia&#8212;Market and Chestnut Streets&#8212;crowded with myriads of people
                &amp; vehicles&#8212;all seemed to be going as if the devil was after them&#8212;the
                crowds &amp; rush &amp; excitement seemed to be much greater even than
                usual&#8212;well I took some three hours of it&#8212;then slowly across the river
                &amp; home&#8212;had my supper, &amp; here I am in perfect quiet up in my room,
                finishing my letter&#8212;Susan my dear friend I hope this will find you all right
                &amp; well again&#8212;but if still unwell, try to keep a good heart&#8212;</p>
