                    <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman</salute>  
                </opener>  
                <p>I have to thank you for many mementoes in the shape of newspapers. One which lately
                    reached me, of Dec 27 1888, contains the welcome news that you are recovering from
                    your last severe &amp; tedious attack of illness.</p>
                <p>Your "November Boughs" has been my companion during the last week. I have read it
                    with the deepest interest, finding the<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00332.jpg" type="verso"/> autobiographical passages regarding your early life &amp; the
                    development of your great scheme particularly valuable. Rejoicing also in the
                    delightful rigour of your critical notes.</p>
                <p>Now I am eager to get the 900 page volume of your Complete Works, &amp; do not know
                    where it is published. I shall try to obtain it through my London bookseller.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.00333.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <p>I have long wished to write about your views regarding the literature of the future.
                    Each time I have attempted to do so, I have quailed before my own inadequacy to
                    grapple with the theme. But I have in preparation a collection of essays on
                    speculative &amp; critical problems, one of which will be called "Democratic
                    Art"<ptr target="loc.05127_n2"/> &amp; will be based upon your "Democratic
                    Vistas"<ptr target="n4122"/> &amp; "Leaves of Grass." This I have been working
                    at during<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.00334.jpg" type="verso"/> the last
                    month; &amp; however imperfect it may be, I have contrived to state in it a portion
                    of what I think the world owes to you both for your suggestions &amp; for the
                    illustrations you have given in your poems—not only by asserting the necessity
                    of a new literature adequate to the people &amp; pregnant with the modern scientific
                    spirit, but also by projecting &amp; to a large extent realizing that literature in
                    your own work.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.00335.jpg" type="recto"/>  
                <p>Meanwhile I am able to echo the words of your friend Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>
                    in his "impromptu criticism,"<ptr target="loc.07537_n6"/> &amp; to congratulate you now in the autumn of your
                    life upon the achievement of a monument "more enduring than brass or marble."</p>
                <p>Believe me, dear master, to be, though a silent &amp; uncommunicative friend, your
                    true respectful &amp; loving disciple</p>
