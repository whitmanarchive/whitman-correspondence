            <p>Of course the main tho't has been yesterday, &amp; is to-day, the death of
                    O'C[onnor]<ptr target="n2002"/>—I enclose the letter of Mrs: O'C<ptr target="n4137"/> rec'd yesterday—</p>  
            <p>(Another death here, old Mrs: Mapes, buried this afternoon,)<ptr target="loc.07623_n2"/>— Y'r letters come &amp; are welcom'd—(if you sent
                one with the calo[mel] prescription, however, it never reach'd me—it was but
                really rec'd two days since)—Am feeling sufficiently easy today—my
                out-door wheelchair<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/> has come &amp; is very satisfactory (both to Ed<ptr target="n4319"/> &amp; me) &amp;
                I intended to get out this forenoon, but I took a rather laborious bath at 10½,
                &amp; felt some exhausted, &amp; shall probably get out a little this
                afternoon—pleasant weather, not quite so warm to-day, but has been markedly
                warm—fair bowel action this forenoon—</p> 
            <p>Some of the friends here in Camden, (lawyers, a teacher or
                two, an editor, Tom Harned,<ptr target="n4146"/> &amp; others) have laid out
                a sort of <hi rend="italic">commemoration formal dinner</hi><ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/> for my arriving my
                70th year old terminus—a good dinner, tickets ($5), toasts, speeches,
                &amp;c.—no wine<ptr target="loc.07623_n3"/>—you have probably rec'd the newspaper item f'm
                    Horace<ptr target="n4267"/>—I have let them go on their own way, as they
                have set their hearts upon it, &amp; they are all quite fellows of love &amp;
                respect—but I have definitely told them it is not certain I shall get there in
                    <hi rend="italic">propria personae</hi>—&amp; if so (wh' I will if
                practicable) w'd only show myself &amp; acknowledge the compliment wh' seems to be
                no more than decent—tho' the <hi rend="italic">jamboree</hi> does not
                present itself as appropriate, or particularly encouragable to my mind—Well
                we shall see—The pocket-bound ed'n<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> is getting on smoothly, &amp; no mishap or hitch
                yet—the printed sheets are at the binder's—Horace sold a big book<ptr target="n4195"/> to-day &amp; McKay<ptr target="n4983"/> another—</p>

            <p>Well I went out in the wheel chair
                yesterday afternoon &amp; was probably out an hour &amp; a half—every thing
                work'd well—the chair is a success &amp; sits &amp; goes easy—Ed of course propell'd me—Shall go out again
                to-day—the weather continues fine, very mild—I sweat quite
                freely—had some good asparagus for my breakfast (sent f'm my brother's garden,<ptr target="n0700b"/>
                Burlington)—Harry Stafford<ptr target="n0590"/> was here yesterday, he is
                pretty thin, is still working managing the RR station at Marlton, NJ—all the
                rest ab't as usual—Wm Ingram<ptr target="n0323"/> comes often.</p>
