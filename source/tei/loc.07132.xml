            <p>I have your post card of 8th<ptr target="loc.07132_n2"/> and your good long letter of
                8th &#38; 9th<ptr target="loc.07132_n3"/>. The latter enclosing Mrs Costelloes<ptr
                    target="loc.02189_n1"/> letter of 28th<ptr target="loc.07132_n4"/> ult. All
                heartily welcome and would have been acknowledged before but I was away in Detroit
                all yest'd'y. We are having today almost a blizzard. The roads were almost bare of
                snow last ev'g and now its deep-deep. And we are all rejoicing for sleighing is the
                correct thing here this time of year and if we do not have it we feel badly used. I
                have the Courier (6th) with long piece abt. tomb&#8212;thanks&#8212;I was real glad
                to get it. I have had no paper with picture (you mention sending one&#8212;did not
                come) or was it the mausoleum pciture you spoke about as being "poor&#8212;bad", I
                guess</p>

            <p>it was for it is a poor affair.<ptr target="loc.07132_n5"/> I have the Critic (29
                Nov)&#8212;I like the notion of the vol. Your own pieces&#8212;Sarrazin<ptr
                    target="n3115"/>, Rolleston<ptr target="n1027"/>, Ingersoll<ptr target="n0839"
                />&#8212;it will make a most interesting little book. Nothing could be better.<ptr
                    target="loc.07132_n6"/></p>

            <p>Yes, dear Walt, be sure and send me a copy of paper with notice of Jefferson's<ptr
                    target="n4995"/> death&#8212;I want much to see it and have it.<ptr
                    target="loc.07132_n7"/> I shall also like much to have a copy of the talk at
                    Reissers<ptr target="loc.07350_n2"/>, do not forget to send it me. Abt.
                    Johnston<ptr target="n0336"/> &#38; the &#36;10. Beers<ptr target="n5000"/> gave
                Johnston &#36;10. on the train (day of lecture) for ticket or tickets&#8212;J.
                showed the &#36;10. bill to Ingersoll &#38; self but I never heard any more about it
                or that J. paid it over to you or any one else. I explained all this to Horace<ptr
                    target="n4267"/>&#8212;he understands it all&#8212;speak to him about it. I was
                very glad to get the letter from Mrs. Costelloe (which you forwarded me)&#8212;I
                never lose interest in the Smiths or Costelloes and always want to hear all I can of
                and from them</p>
