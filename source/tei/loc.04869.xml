            <p>Frank and I read your "Old Age's Lambent Peaks"<ptr target="loc.07660_n4"/> yesterday afternoon as we sat
                together by the sea and he thought and spoke much of you as he often do.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend&#8212;I wish that you could be with us to enjoy <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01329.jpg" type="verso"/> on these, to me, beautiful <hi
                    rend="underline">grey</hi> afternoons when there is no glare from the sun, <hi
                    rend="underline">few</hi> people, so that one may be almost alone on the quiet
                beach and have only one's thoughts and the sounding sea.</p>
            <p>I think you will be interested to know that my cousin, of whom I have made mention to
                you as being intimate with the Lewes household;<ptr target="n4179"/> has <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.01330.jpg" type="recto"/> just returned from England where he
                has talked much of you. He is one of Frank's converts to the Whitman side and is now
                most enthusiastic and fairly raves about you.</p>
            <p>When is the new book to be out I hope it will be a great success! You will be sorry,
                I am sure, to hear that Churchill<ptr target="n4178"/> has had Typhoid Fever he is
                quite recovered however by this time and is growing very stout. I dont suppose his
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01331.jpg" type="verso"/> Father ever
                told you, how very well he did in College last winter. He took the "English prize" and
                in athletics he did remarkably well, being the <hi rend="underline">sixth</hi>
                strongest man ever examined in the University. I hope no one but yourself will see
                this letter as I am sure it would bore anyone else to read it but knowing your love
                for Churchill I have not hesitated to
                    "<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">bra</unclear>g" a little. With love from the boys
                and hoping you may scrawl a line just to prove you have not forgotten </p>
