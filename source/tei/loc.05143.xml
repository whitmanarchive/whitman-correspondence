                <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have this morning received from you the large copy of Specimen days,<ptr target="n0119"/> as also the
                1882 photograph, besides two postcards both of 9<hi rend="superscript"><hi
                        rend="underline">th</hi></hi> inst.</p>
            <p>I think you know that the present of the
                (largesize) book will be (is) appreciated by me&#8212;I am also very much pleased to
                have the photo, both to tell me how you look now and for my collection. The other
                copy of S.D. from Rees Welsh and Co.<!--<ptr target="loc.05143_n1"/>--> arrived on <choice>
                    <orig>Mondy</orig><reg>Monday</reg></choice>, I have been pretty well over it but so far have noticed no typographical
                errors, I shall go over it more leisurely after a little &#38; will look out then.</p>
                <p>Rudolph Schmidt sent me a copy of his book containing his article
                on Walt Whitman<!--<ptr target="loc.05143_n2"/>--> I have put it in the hands of some Danish friends who are to
                translate it for me. Now my dear Walt I don't want to hurry you or worry you but now that you have L. <choice>
                    <orig>&amp;</orig>
                    <reg>of</reg>
                </choice> G. and S.D. both off your hands and all settled I hope you will soon fix
                definitely about your visit here that we may get the "study" in shape for
                publication. I have scarcely touched it for months now but I do not lose interest in
                it or its subject. The appearance of S.D. will make a good many minor changes necessary 
                but as far as I see it does not make the issue of the "Study"
                any less desirable&#8212;I hope S.D. will sell and that Rees Welsh &#38; Co. will
                feel disposed to take hold of my book.</p> <p>O'Connor has never sent me
                that "Modern Thought"<!--<ptr target="loc.05143_n3"/>--> I will write him a card and stir him up.</p>
                    <p>As to S.D. it is a
                suitable finish up to your work, it is what we (those who know something of you)
                have been wanting for a long time and what the future will want still more and will
                prize far more even than we can prize it now&#8212;it is all on a low key (as it
                ought to be) no fine writing but plain prose giving the <gap reason="illegible"
                    extent="1 word"/>
                just the insight that we wanted into your common every day life, and
                your ordinary every day manner of looking at things&#8212;I think you may now say
                that your work is done, I do not see any more for you to do at all events <unclear
                    reason="illegible" resp="#ss" cert="medium"
                    >though</unclear>
                perhaps you will see something, when you have had time to look about again a bit.<!--<ptr target="loc.05143_n3"/>--></p>
