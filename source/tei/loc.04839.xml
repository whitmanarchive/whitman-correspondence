          <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
           </opener>
            <p>The American Mail has not come in yet&#8212;delayed probably by the
                gales we are having. We look forward anxiously to its arrival,
                hoping that it will bring tidings of continued improvement &amp; increasing strength.<ptr target="loc.02538_n4b"/></p>
            <p>The wind is blowing "great guns" as I write, yesterday &amp; today having been
                very stormy, with showers of
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02024_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                hail and rain.</p>
            <p>Geo Humphreys<ptr target="loc.02495_n2b"/> came
                here on Saturday afternoon &amp; spent the afternoon &#38; evening with me. 
                We spent most of the time reading &amp; talking
                about you. I never had a more appreciative auditor. 
                I read quite a lot aloud, including nearly all the Preface to the 1855 edition,<ptr target="loc.04716_n4"/>
                &amp; he seemed quite entranced, &amp; <hi rend="underline">thrilled</hi> as if he were
                receiving a succession of electric shocks.&#8212;I happened to have a reprint of the Preface
                (given me by Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/>) which I gave him.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02025_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I met a work mate of his the other week who told me
                what a powerful influence Humphreys has on his mates.
                "He has made new men of us" he said. He has gathered
                quite a large group round him&#8212;nicknamed "the School"&#8212;with 
                whom he talks on social questions &amp; incites to read&#8212;Carlyle<ptr target="n4301"/>
                for instance. He is the chief founder of what they call the 
                ["]Co-operative Commonwealth" in Bolton&#8212;socialistic in theory 
                &amp; aims&#8212;which began a few years
                ago with a capital of 10s/- &amp; &amp; is now prospering wonderfully. 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02026_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Fifteen persons are regularly employed&#8212;weaving &#38;c&#8212;including 
                a few women&#8212;&amp; they are just purchasing new premises for which
                they are paying &#163;1900!</p>  
            <p>Humphreys is a very likeable fellow indeed&#8212;earnest
                &amp; active with a winning sympathy &amp; kindliness of manner
                very attractive to me. He is well read &amp; thoughtful
                &amp; is a man I am heartily glad to be friends with.
                I am sure that he will prove to be (as he has been in
                the past) a centre of beneficial influence to many others. And
                he is wonderfully advanced
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02027_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                in his appreciation of L of G &amp; his love for their author.
                And he is "as proud as a dog with two tails" of the
                copy you sent him.<ptr target="loc.02507_n9"/></p>
            <p>I had a brief letter from Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/> yesterday.
                He is at York just now &amp; very busy. He talks
                of coming here some time before long.</p>
            <p>I was at Johnston's<ptr target="n4102"/> last night for a short time.
                He was quite well after a busy day. The rest of
                the friends<ptr target="loc.04707_n3"/> are all well &amp; moving along as usual.</p>
            <p>It is a great joy to me to write to you again
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02028_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with a reasonable hope of your being able to read it.
                Even if you do not read it it will serve as a token
                of love &amp; best wishes which are the same always &amp; come
                from my deepest heart.</p>
