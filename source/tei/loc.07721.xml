                                    New York is to have a monument to Goethe.<ptr target="n0270"/> It is to be erected in Central Park, at an expense
                                    of $30,000. The sculptor is Henry Baerer,<ptr target="n4332"/> who designed the Beethoven monument in New York
                                    and the John Howard Payne statue in Brooklyn. The Goethe monument is to be twenty-four feet high, with a colossal bronze
                                    figure of the great German poet at the summit, and four lifesize sitting groups in bronze around the granite
                                    pedestal, viz., "Faust and Margaret," "Iphigenia and Orestes," "Hermann and Dorothea at the Well," "The Harpist and Mignon."
                                    The cost will be defrayed by the students and admirers of Goethe, with the coöperation of the Goethe Society.</p>

                                    In person, Emin is a slender man, of medium height, and tough and wiry figure. He is swarthy,
                                    with black eyes and hair. His face is that of a studious professional man, and that impression is heightened
                                    by the glasses which he always wears. His attitudes and movements are, however, very alert. He stands erect and with his heels
                                    together, as if he had been trained as a soldier. He was always reticent about himself, and his history
                                    was knownt to no one in the Soudan or the Provinces of the Equator. He was supposed to be a Mohammedan. I am not sure
                                    that he ever said that he was, but I am quite sure that he did not deny it when I knew him. It has become known later
                                    that he is a German, of university education; but there were many at that time who thought that he was a Turk of extraordinary
                                    acquirements. He is certainly a man of great ability in many ways, and of strong character. Just why such a man should have gone where he has and stayed there is
                                    hard to see. Probably it was largely force of circumstances and a spirit of adventure. Certainly when he went there there was no prospect of much
                                    pay or distinction, and he was actuated by no great philanthropic ardor. Responsibilities gradually came upon him, and he rose to them.
                                    It is easy to see how, in a character like Emin's—sympathetic, reflective and enthusiastic—noble purposes were developed
                                    with a noble example before him and great opportunities around him. Emin's uncertain power in a savage land is all that remains of the late khedive's 
                                    central African Empire. [Colonel H. G. Prout, in November Scribner.</p>

            <p>I am immensely pleased (tickled) with the result of my little Wifekin Dame Kennedy's visit to
                you. She has read yr books &amp; Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> ever since she has
                returned. She was <hi rend="underline">finally</hi> converted by the impression made
                by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great
                magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to-day a tremendous <choice><orig>arraingment</orig><reg>arraignment</reg></choice>
                of the Leslie <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#smb">Nutler</unclear><ptr target="n5000"/> I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed
                my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England &amp;
                America) who stand up for W. W. &amp; love him she says, "Thoreau<ptr target="hun.00052_n3"/> thinks he is a great fellow, &amp; I think so, too." She says, "I saw
                with my own eyes, his nobility &amp; manners," &amp;c. She thoroughly understands and
                approves yr Children of Adam poems, too! Sees <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03053.002.jpg" type="verso"/>their noble purpose.</p>
            <p>She doesn't <hi rend="underline">need</hi> you so much as I did, though, for she has
                always been a liberated spirit. Her father &amp; grandfather were deists.</p>
            <p>I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the
                heart of shams &amp; humbugs.
                Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital of
                some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.</p>
            <p>Just begun to rain. The wooded hills &amp; farmstead slopes give grand spreads of
                dull-glowing brown; not bright but rich-subdued. Have you had any new cider yet. I
