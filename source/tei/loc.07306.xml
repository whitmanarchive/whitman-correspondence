            <p>I have today the new L. of G. "31 May 1889."<ptr target="loc.07306_n1"/> It is a lovely little book. I am
                thoroughly delighted with it. I have a few cuttings from eastern papers this evening
                (sent by a friend) in re dinner.<ptr target="loc.03027_n4"/> Very glad to see that you were actually present and
                (more than I expected) spoke a few words.<ptr target="loc.07306_n2"/> I shall hope to have the papers in full
                and some short account of the affair in M.S. from you or Horace.<ptr target="loc.07306_n3"/> I judge from what I
                see in the papers that the dinner was a success. I am rejoiced, dear friend, that
                you have stayed with us to get out the <hi rend="underline">big</hi><ptr target="n4195"/> and the <hi
                    rend="underline">last</hi> eds. and for this dinner It will surely be patent
                to all now that you have <hi rend="underline">come to stay</hi>&#8212;patent 
                or not to the rest it is to me an evident fact. It is wonderfull<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00602.jpg" type="verso"/>
                how much more <hi rend="underline">grip</hi> you seem to have on the world now
                than even five years ago and the last year even has made an immense difference. Yes,
                Walt, you are undoubtedly <hi rend="underline">an institution</hi> and if I live
                another twenty years (which is very doubtful!) I shall not be surprised to see my
                highest claims for you (for making which I have been counted a lunatic)<ptr target="loc.07306_n4"/> broadly and
                even generally allowed. My copy of Sarrazin<ptr target="n3115"/> has come to hand by the afternoon's
                mail&#8212;it is as you said, a lovely little book.<ptr target="loc.07306_n5"/> Our spell of dark, cold, rainy
                weather has let up at last and we have summer again&#8212;not very warm yet but
                getting warm&#8212;it is now 5 P.M. a charming warm, bright evening: our lilacs
                are out and the grounds look well</p>
