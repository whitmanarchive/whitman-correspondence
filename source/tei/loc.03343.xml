            <p>Greeting, my dear Poet, for your 71<hi rend="underline">st</hi> birthday&#8212;now so close at hand,&#8212;greeting 
                &#38; all good wishes! These wishes have a new force to-day, when we watch your 
                ship of fate end yet another year's voyage&#8212;after storms &#38; many troubles of 
                wind &#38; weather. I trust the new year's voyage will at least be less painful,&#8212;free 
                from such vexations as that of my Lady, <hi rend="underline">La Grippe</hi>, who, 
                like the rest of us, seems to have become only too fond of you.</p>
            <p>Your letter of 11th inst<ptr target="loc.03343_n1"/>&#8212;with slips 
                enc<hi rend="underline">d</hi>&#8212;&#8212; reached me last evening, only just in time! for the passage 
                oversea seems to have taken 12 days instead of 10. On first opening your letter I 
                did not realise that next morning was the 24<hi rend="underline">th</hi>, &#38; went off unconcernedly enough to
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03343.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            a little gathering of some friends of mine, (who call themselves the 'Rhymesters' Club'), 
            which took place in the garden of the old 'Spaniards' Inn near here&#8212;on Hampstead 
            Heath. There, after we had regaled in a green arbour, just as twilight stole down upon the 
            groups of trees &#38; the green fields below us, I drew out your 'Twilight Song', telling 
            the fellows you had just sent it, &#38; read it to them,&#8212;to their profound delight 
            (though I'm afraid I read it badly enough).</p>
            <p>Later when I got back here to my rooms, &#38; read your reference to the slips again, 
                I realised that if they were to be in any editors' hands in time for to-day's papers 
                they must be despatched somehow at once! This led to a notable night-excursion from these 
                heights of Hampstead down to Fleet-street, where I arrived something after midnight, going part 
                of the way by train&#8212;to Camden Town Sta. (for we have a Camden too), part by train or horse-car. 
                Though so late, when I passed the portico of the
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03343.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            Covent Garden Opera-house, the carriages were still in full-swing&#8212; at nearly half-past 
            Twelve. There must have been an unusually long performance;&#8212;Wagner's 'Lohengrin' had been 
            given! Returning <hi rend="underline">via</hi> Drury Lane&#8212;a choice place for scenes 
                in the Cockney comedy &#38; tragedy!&#8212;the struggles &#38; awful oaths of a madly 
                drunken women in a dark passage formed a little picture dreadful in the extreme, &#38; 
                yet very dramatic. In Oxford street then, feeling tired, I took a cab ('hansom,' with 
                capital driver &#38; fast horse) for a couple of miles or so; &#38; after that climbed the 
                hill to Hampstead cheerfully enough under the stars&#8212;for it was an almost perfect 
                May night. The clock struck Two&#8212;as I heard through the trees that surround this 
                place&#8212;just as I got into bed; &#38; so ended a memorable jaunt. Thus, you see, 
                that verse to the Queen has something of a history after its arrival in London.</p>
             <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03343.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>The only paper which seems to have put the <hi rend="underline">par</hi>. in is the 
                'Pall Mall Gazette,' which put on its posters very conspicuously&#8212;'the Queen's 
                Birthday: Verses by Walt Whitman!' so that one saw it at every street-corner &#38; 
                news-stall. I suppose your name was never so extenseivly paraded in the outside public 
                of London before! This well makes up for the unaccountable remissness of the morning 
                papers&#8212;whose chief editors have in some cases gone away for Whitsuntide holidays, 
                I imagine, &#38; left careless subs. in their place! I send copy of 'P.M.G.' &#38; also 
                'P.M. Budget'<ptr target="loc.03343_n2"/> with article of mine on J.A. Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> reprinted, in 
                very curtailed form, from the Gazette of a few days earlier. I must get the 'Budget' 
                to put you in its portrait-gallery on front page, one of these days.&#8212;</p>
             <p>Many of your friends here have been asking after you lately. All, I think, remain much 
                 as ever.&#8212;I hope you will have weather as good as we have been having this May 
                 in London for your birthday. It is the finest Spring we have had for years.</p>
            <closer><salute>With remembrance to all friends, &#38; again love &#38; good wishes for 
                your birthday,</salute><signed>Ernest Rhys</signed></closer>
