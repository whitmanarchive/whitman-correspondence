                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your card was welcomed the other day; but I was sorry it did not give a better
                account of your present condition. I hope the bright American autumn weather will
                serve you better than the summer has done,&#8212;bringing a renascence of the
                imagination at least.</p>
            <p>If in imagination you could only come to this Welsh mountain valley, &#38; go
                exploring some of its mountain sides &#38; its swift streams with me in this
                splendid October sunshine,&#8212;this alone would be a sufficient <choice>
                    <sic>medecine</sic>
                    <reg>medicine</reg>
                </choice> for the soul surely! I suppose these late weeks here have been the
                happiest of my life,&#8212;in the sense of physical delight at any rate; &#38; the
                keen pure air makes one mentally alert &#38; energetic too. A good <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03334.002.jpg" type="verso"/> part of every
                day goes in excursions across the mountains, but I usually write in the mornings
                &#38; evenings&#8212;of necessity, &#38; so get through a fair amount of work.</p>
            <p>The life of the farm, which you know so well in the States, is essentially the same
                here no doubt. Harvest is late this year, &#38; on some farms the corn is not yet
                all gathered in; but here at Blaen Sawdde, the two energetic sons of the house
                working under the shrewd &#38; restless direction of their father, the last field
                was stacked ten days or more ago. Old William Williams,<ptr target="n5001"/> the father, is a typical
                Welsh peasant of the better class. He is just seventy years old, &#38; except for
                indigestion &#38; occasional rheumatism, is very hale &#38; strong for his age, as I
                found out one day soon after coming here, when he took up the hatchet to show me how
                to chop a log of wood in two. Of the two sons now at home, the eldest David<ptr target="n5001"/> is about
                34 years old, &#38; William<ptr target="n5001"/> about 25.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03334.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Like most Welshmen, they are both good <choice><sic>singer's</sic><corr>singers</corr></choice>, &#38; take bass in the parish church
                on Sundays. William moreover is a remarkably comely &#38; well-built youth, without
                an evil trick in his whole nature. It is really inspiring to see him at work: he
                does everything with such ease &#38; strength. And he is equally quick mentally, and
                reads English &#38; Welsh readily &#38; with imagination. I almost envy him his
                self-reliance &#38; manly sufficiency.</p>
            <p>Two days ago quite a momentous event,&#8212;the bi-annual sale by auction of sheep,
                cattle &#38; mountain ponies, took place at the farm, &#38; some hundreds of farmers
                rode across the mountains &#38; from the surrounding hamlets to attend it. The sight
                of so many sturdy countrymen, with their ponies &#38; beautiful collie dogs, would
                have delighted you greatly. A plentiful supply of Welsh ale &#38; beef &#38; mutton
                &#38; other things made a feast quite Baronial, &#38; put them all into good humour.
                In the evening the younger fellows wrestled on <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03334.004.jpg" type="verso"/> the grass until the new moon sank 
                behind the hills &#38; it was too dark to see any longer. Later they sat round the
                fire, &#38; sang &#38; told stories,&#8212;all in Welsh of course, &#38; some score
                or more of them did not return home, but stayed here &#38; sat up all night,
                continuing the fun. Altogether a fine experience for me, as you may imagine. Every
                day I gather in this way some new association to add to my store; &#38; all the
                while I am picking up the Welsh idiom, difficult as it is, &#38; hope in a month or
                two to be able to read the old Welsh MSS. poetry &#38; romances chiefly at the
                British Museum.</p>
            <p>I am glad to think that <hi rend="underline">November Boughs</hi><ptr target="n3999"/> &#38; the complete
                900 page volume<ptr target="n4151"/> are so nearly ready, &#38; look forward to having them. It is within
                the bounds of possibility that I may write a review of the complete book for one of
                our leading monthlies,&#8212;the XIXth Century<ptr target="loc.03334_n2"/> or Fortnightly Review;<ptr target="loc.03334_n3"/> but I must not be too sure.</p>
            <p>If Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is with you, give him greetings. &#38; Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> too.</p>
