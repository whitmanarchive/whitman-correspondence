                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of the 4th I
                received this morning. The number of Harper's<!-- <ptr target="n0290"/> --> magazine and of
                the New York Tribune did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> follow, but most probably
                they will reach me; printed matter is very often going an other way. If your "Prayer
                of Columbus"<!-- <ptr target="n0482"/> --> be not too long, I shall try to get a translation of it published in
                one of our papers.</p>

            <p>Immediately after my return from <name type="place">Germany</name> (28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> February) I did write to
                you and sent you a long article of your book in the paper "Fædrelandet"
                (fatherland); the last monday I mailed for you another article in the weekly paper
                "Naer og Fjern" (Near and Far). All these things have been sent to <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. To the Treasury in <name type="place">Washington</name> have been sent in all <hi rend="underline">three</hi> copies
                of "Demokratiske Fremblik", one in loose sheets (<supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">franked</supplied>), one complete paper bound copy
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">franked</supplied> and
                one other (for greater safety, as unpaid letters and papers never fail their
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">man</unclear>). Some copies of
                    "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="nnk">Illustreret</unclear>
                Fædrelandet" (peoples illustrated magazine) with <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01910.002.jpg" type="verso"/> your portrait and some short
                biographical notices have also been sent to <name type="place">Washington</name>.</p>

            <p>With Clausen<!-- <ptr target="n0163"/> --> I sent you in the <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">autumn 1872</supplied> a large portrait of mine,
                the only resembling one, that ever has been taken. Write to Mrs Clausen, if they
                have not forwarded it to you.</p>

            <p>If you could, without troubling yourself too much, send me <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the pieces of <name type="person">Clemens Petersen</name>, that come
                to your eye-sight, I should be very glad. This singular man has a great charm to me,
                though I never liked him.</p>

            <p>If my thoughts did not weaken and wither, when I try to give them expression in the
                English language, I should on some sheets give you a due description of our
                political and literary doings. Although the word of Hamlet: there is something
                rotten in the state of Denmark, still are true, I have the greatest belief of the
                vitality of my people and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">the</unclear> other Scandinavian peoples. We have been living here in the
                outskirts of civilization; we have been endowed with its gifts, but we <choice>
                    <sic>have have</sic>
                    <corr>have</corr>
                </choice> not been poisoned with its venom. Ours is the future in Europe, small as
                we are.</p>

            <p>In no European country, and most probably also not in <name type="place">America</name>, your personality, your mode of <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01910.003.jpg" type="recto"/> viewing the things shall be more sure to
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">touch</unclear> the chord of
                the native mind as here and in <name type="place">Norway</name>. We are made of the
                true democratic stuff, we have not the venomous passions, but we have the high ideal
                aspiration. A peasant on <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">Fijen</supplied> (one of our fertile isles) wrote to me in the spring for two
                years ago to thank me for my article on you. Peasants are on the <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">sundays holding</supplied> the
                numbers of "for <gap reason="illegible" extent="about three words" unit="chars" quantity="15"/>, in their <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">hard fists</supplied> and read every word, though the matters often
                are very difficult.</p>

            <p>But on the <hi rend="underline">political</hi> arena our democratic leaders are dull
                and narrowminded persons, to say nothing worse. None of them has named your book
                yet, most probably they won't name it at all. It is your (political) adversaries,
                who wrote criticisms on you. But your adversaries are mostly your friends, they have
                themselves a democratic mind and grant you much more than the editors of the
                American magazines. But your best friends are the women. A young Baroness <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">Fraupe</unclear> has read your books
                with true enthusiasm. The women have understood, that the ordinary criticisms can as
                easily be applied on a <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">nature</unclear> like yours as the process of hair cutting and shaving on a
                mountain forest. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01910.004.jpg" type="verso"/> "It
                is nearly comical", writes a young <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">married</unclear><!-- could also, perhaps be "manner"? KM --> lady to
                me, "to see the critics cut and <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">crop</unclear> the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">broad</unclear> American till they have given him their own small figure."</p>

            <p>Your early female friend Mrs <supplied reason="illegible" source="#traubel" resp="#km">Rorle</supplied> lies <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">deathly</unclear> over in Rome&#8212;poor thing.</p>

            <p>Professor Rasmus Nielson has read your book with the greatest satisfaction. He is the
                only man, who could give a true criticism on it, but he is an old man and not very
                willing to write in the papers.</p>

            <p>Hoping a speedy amelioration of your health I remain</p>
