                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I got your envelope with the proof sheet of the poem, which I afterwards saw in the
                magazine.<ptr target="n1081"/> Thanks.</p>

            <p>I was delighted with the poem. No poem in the English tongue excels it in beauty or
                equals it in grandeur.</p>
            <p>The Springfield <hi rend="underline">Republican</hi><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal_ch.00004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> article I forwarded at once, as you
                desired, to Dr. Bucke.<ptr target="n0119"/> I wonder who wrote it. Bucke, whom that infamous <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi> article never stirred, was roused by this, and
                wrote me a slogging comment on it! For my own part, it (the Republican article) made
                me marvel. The implied tribute to you is so high, that the rest makes me wonder. His
                interpretation (I mean the Republican writer's) seemed<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="yal_ch.00005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> to me quite an instantial piece of
                pure wrong-headedness. Where you wrote "physiological", he reads "sexual", and then
                makes an ass of himself in commentary.</p>
            <p>John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> is here. It is five years since I saw him, and his appearance gave me
                delight. He tells me you think of settling up on the Hudson, which I should fancy<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="yal_ch.00003_large.jpg" type="verso"/> a good idea.</p>
            <p>John says he heard that <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> article which I walloped in
                Bucke's book was written by a woman! This seems <hi rend="underline">impossible</hi>. I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> make my belief square with such a notion.<ptr target="n1082"/></p>
            <p><hi rend="underline">Au revoir</hi>. I am up to my ears in office work, wretchedly
                unwell, and wish I could be away. The devil Ennui has been celebrated; there is
                another far more terrible and malign; it is the foul fiend Routine!</p>
