            </opener>
            <p>Quite a long letter you wrote me:<ptr target="loc.01226_n1"/> many thanks for it,
                &#38; for all the items of news it contained. I am glad <choice><sic>Abagail</sic><corr>Abigail</corr></choice><ptr target="loc.01226_n2"/> called to see you. I urged her to do so weeks
                ago. I am very sorry you do not get out anymore. <choice>
                    <sic>Your</sic>
                    <corr>You're</corr>
                </choice> right not to surrender in that way without a struggle.</p>

            <p>I keep pretty well, except a very bad cold lately, but the winter has been a vacant
                unprofitable one to me so far. My domestic skies are not pleasant &#38; I seem
                depressed &#38; restless most of the time. I am interested in that Ernest Rhys<ptr
                    target="n4152"/>&#8212;wish you had told me more about him. I should like to
                meet him if I know where he was to be seen. I saw an abstract of a lecture of his on
                the New Poetry, some months ago,<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01226.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> that contained an admirable statement about your poetry. I will
                go &#38; hear him lecture if he speaks in N.Y.</p>
            <p>Two of the poems you enclosed were new to me. I liked them much. Your one to
                Whittier<ptr target="n1029"/> was very happy.<ptr target="duk.00865_n1"/> A steady snow fall here
                to-day, the river a white plain. I dislike the winters more &#38; more &#38; shall
                not try to spend another in this solitude. Indeed I am thinking strongly of selling
                my place. I am<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01226.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                sick of the whole business of housekeeping. If it was not for Julian<ptr
                    target="loc.01151_n1"/> I should not hesitate a moment. J. goes to school &#38;
                is a bright happy boy, very eager for knowledge, &#38; with a quick intelligence. He
                alone makes life tolerable to me.</p>
