            <p>I received the "November boughs"<ptr target="n6177b"/> and like the general get up of the book much.
                It has a fresh, inviting appearance, &#38; one wonders what it contains,
                something good&#8212;sure! The most I have had time for yet is the Hicks 
                article.<ptr target="n0301"/> I think you have done good
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03202.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                work for the long neglected. It is genial, inspiring, picture-like. If the
               old broad brims<ptr target="loc.03202_n3"/> of Richmond were not so close fisted, I should predict that
               they would buy copies of the book by the score, but my experience with them
               was that they wilted when the cost of things that enthused them stepped, 
               however modestly, to the front. 
               Blake<ptr target="loc.07590_n5"/> is very much pleased to get the book, &#38; will I expect give it a good
               description in their <hi rend="underline">Unity</hi>.<ptr target="loc.03202_n4"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03202.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I hear by Horace<ptr target="n3041"/> that you are moderately comfortable &#38; holding
            on to your life interests. Do you know that is about the summing up 
            for us all&#8212;moderately, so, so.</p>
            <p>I am doing fairly well&#8212;am getting where I pay expenses now, with my entertainments.
               A wealthy lady of culture<ptr target="n5001"/> by chance came to one of my evenings at
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03202.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                B's church, &#38; was <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">thus pleased</unclear>, she bought 
                my Carlyle<ptr target="n1065"/> &#38; Emerson,<ptr target="n0218b"/> &#38; engaged
                me for two parlor <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">entertainments</unclear> at her own home.<ptr target="loc.03202_n2"/> The
                first I gave last week Thursday to a company of some 30 young ladies&#8212;very
                bright they were, and responsive. It was the most successful so far of all I have done.
                To-morrow afternoon I give to the girls <hi rend="underline">parents</hi>. 
                They are reputed to have culture &#38; money, &#38; to be "very swell."
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03202.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                If they receive me as pleasantly as the young folk did, I shall
                at least, enjoy the occasion myself. The young ladies, ranging from 18 to 25 perhaps,
               were all alert, sympathetic, eager, enthusiastic. I drew with 
               chalk &#38; worked the clay&#8212;modeling rough 
               a head of Cleveland,<ptr target="n4271"/> &#38; then, changing it
                to Harrison<ptr target="n4269"/>&#8212;a work not exceeding five minutes.<ptr target="loc.07472_n2"/> They happened to be all
                republicans, so I finished on the top wave of great applause. Then
                they gathered around &#38; took a poke at the clay themselves&#8212; told me 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03202.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                they are mostly graduates of <choice><sic>Welsely</sic><corr>Wellesley</corr></choice> College, near Boston. I was engaged for
                an hour, but 3 hours passed before the company broke up, with lunch &#38;
                souvenirs of little clay heads.</p> 
            <p>This introduction promises to expand into a winter's work very pleasing
                and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">financialy</unclear> satisfying, as well. 
                To-morrow I am to take all the art-work
                I have here, &#38; the lady is to procure other things so we can turn her
                back parlor into a studio on wh. she can open her <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">folding</unclear> 
                doors at the appointed hour.
                It is suggested that I call these entertainments <hi rend="underline">Morse's Studios</hi>&#8212;so
                people will say, "Go to, now: let us have one of Morse's Studios in our parlors. It is quite the
                thing." Ahem! Let the lady that presides over your house read this &#38; 
                say how it sounds.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03202.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <p>We are having charming weather just now. The Election interest warms up &#38; the 
                din is to be heard every evening. It looks to me as though Harrison has made a steady gain
                over the country, while Cleveland has been guilty of much clap-trap. Undoubtedly 
                the situation in N.Y. has grown desperate. Some of Harrison's little speeches I have
                noticed have been excellent in form &#38; sentiment. He has certainly grown himself &#38;
                in public estimtation. At first it looked as though Blaine<ptr target="n4268"/> would eclipse 
                <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">the Harrison</unclear>
                but quietly he has come to the front, &#38; Blaine has fallen back.
                B's reception here was hearty, but when H's name was mentioned the audience
                rose to their feet.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.03202.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>I am a looker on. 
                The issue of the voting not so much, but
                the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">education</unclear> of
                the campaign very much. 
                The whole business of government is getting quite an airing.</p>
                
                <p>The little suggestions of Chicago coldness we have had,
                so penetrating to bone &#38; marrow, cause me to 
                dread the coming winter. I'd like a Southern trip.
                With many thinkings of you constantly, &#38; love,</p>
