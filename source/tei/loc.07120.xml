            <p>Well, dear Walt, here I am safely settled down at home again and Horace<ptr
                target="n4267"/> is here with me<ptr target="loc.07120_n2"/>&#8212;I wish he could stay for a good visit but
                I believe he will have to leave us in a very few days. I have been at work all this
                morning getting ready my first lecture on insanity for the students; which lecture I
                deliver tomorrow after-</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_sd.00060.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>noon&#8212;2 to 4&#8212;</p>

            <p>We got home, as I guess you know, friday evening about 7 o'clock&#8212;All yesterday
                I was very busy looking into matters which had accumulated in my absence and today,
                as I have said, about my lecture. Tomorrow morning Clare<ptr target="loc.07284_n4"/>
                leaves home for Chicago and the west&#8212;she will visit in Indiana and, I think,
                Tennesee before she returns home.</p>

            <p>Horace &#38; I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow&#8212;Horace, I think, is quite
                anxious about being away from you so long. I found Mrs Bucke<ptr target="n4273"/>
                and all the children quite well on my return and Horace will tell you all about them
                when he sees you. Horace is quite struck with Pardee<ptr target="loc.07347_n5"/> (your old
                favorite) and thinks him a splended boy&#8212;as indeed he is.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_sd.00061.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>It is cold today and dark and windy as well; we shall soon be having snow and real
                wintry weather here. I have been showing Horace something of my W.W. collection and
                H. is to take some copies of L. of G. (old eds.) back with him to have you put your
                name in them.&#8212;</p>
