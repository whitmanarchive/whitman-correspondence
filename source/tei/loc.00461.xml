            <p>I wrote you a few days ago apprising you as to Mattie's health  I do not see that there is any change since then&#8212;if any she is somewhat easier&#8212;that is these terrible fits of coughing and choking do not come so often&#8212;yet when they do come I hardly expect her to come out of them</p>
            <p>The weather has been exceedingly pleasant here for four or five days now and I have had Mattie out in the buggy for about an hour each day&#8212;this seems to do her more good than anything else</p>
            <p>To-day, if I can arrange it I intend to take her to a photograph gallery to have another picture taken</p>
            <p>She speaks often and much about you&#8212;and wants to see you very, very much&#8212;I suppose you would hardly dare undertake the journey&#8212;and it would be impossible for me to leave her to come for you&#8212;of course I would arrange all the money matters if you could come&#8212;I suppose you know how the coming would be&#8212;you would take a "section" in one of the through sleeping cars&#8212;you would be abt 40 hours on the car&#8212;this car would bring you to East St. Louis&#8212;where I would meet you&#8212;here we would take a carriage that would take you to the house&#8212;Of course I can understand that you may not feel able for the journey&#8212;but I feel positive that if you once did get here you would feel better than you do<ptr target="loc.00461_n1"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>I will write you as soon as I can again  Love to George and Loo and Eddy&#8212;I hope you are feeling pretty well dear Mother</p>
