                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have to thank you for the copy of the "<hi rend="underline">The Critic</hi>" (March
                7) you sent me, &#38; for your kind post card of 
                March 14<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.04705_n2"/>&#8212;both duly received.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to learn that at the time of writing you had "no cheery or favorable news
                to send of physique." The weather here all through March has been bleak &#38;
                stormy, &#38; we can only hope that the better weather to follow will in part
                restore you.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01140.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I do not think that I "expect too much from the 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi> Annex,"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/>
                &#38; am prepared for its being "very brief" &#38; "most of it seen already." But,
                though the fact that "it is brought out in sickness &#38; great depression" has
                resulted in brevity &#38; a less full expression than you might wish, yet I am very
                sure that it's influence &#38; effect will be all the greater; &#38; I do not doubt
                that a wise intent, greater than your own, will be fulfilled in it. At any rate we
                shall recognize in it, with all the more tender gratitude, your "soul-dearest leaves
                confirming all the rest&#8212;the faithfulest&#8212;hardiest&#8212;best."<ptr target="loc.04705_n3"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01141.jpg" type="recto"/> 
            <p>I have arranged to meet "the College" on this day fortnight, April 10<hi
                    rend="underline">th</hi>, &#38; to give them an address on the 1855 edition of
                L. of G., with readings from the Preface.</p>
            <p>I wish to give them a rough outline&#8212;so far as I can trace it (from the records
                of your previous life, from your ultimate decision &#38; aims, &#38; from scattered
                passages &#38; indirections throughout your poems)&#8212;of the "long foreground"<ptr target="loc.04705_n4"/> of
                experiences, thought &#38; emotions from which it rose. Of course I can only do this
                in approximate outline, but I hope, in this way, to give the book an added personal
                interest.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01142.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I shall, perhaps, be on surer ground in attempting to explain the symbolism of its
                title &#38; colour &#38; in reading extracts from the Preface with special reference to your
                own aims, performance &#38; personality.</p>
            <p>But, at most, I only wish&#8212;as one student working with others&#8212;to incite
                them to further study for themselves.</p>
            <p>I hope to arrange for another meeting on April 14<hi rend="underline">th</hi> to read
                over your lecture on the death of Lincoln<ptr target="med.00796_n2"/>&#8212;as we
                have done before.</p>
            <p>I write this on Good Friday morning (holiday here) after a busy week. The weather is
                occasionally stormy (hail showers) with gleams of sunshine. After dinner I expect
                some friends&#8212;perhaps Dr Johnston.<ptr target="n4102"/></p>
            <p>With loving thanks &#38; good wishes</p>
