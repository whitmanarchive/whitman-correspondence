            <p>I much regret to learn that your old trouble has returned upon you &amp; that
                at the time of writing you were suffering from "fearful inertia"

            <p>Our stay here has been very pleasant indeed as when we have been
                favoured with fine weather for the most part &amp; the place

            <p>I have spent this afternoon strolling thro' the fields reading the

                now drafting this letter to you sitting on a cliff overlooking the sea
                now on the ebb. A stiff N.W. breeze is blowing &amp; the great waves
                are shivering themselves to spray &amp; leaping in from against the Niarbyl
                rocks with a thunderous roar The sun is shining upon the heaving
                water with a dazzling gleam &amp; some screaming seagulls are sailing high
                over the seaweed covered rocks where a couple of boys are crab fishing</p>

                &amp; close by me some black-faced sheep are quietly nibbling the long grass, &amp;

                We left Ballacooil early this morning &amp; after
                a 5-mile drive &amp; a 10 mile railway ride we reached Douglas where
                the "Mona's Queen" was waiting to carry us across the Irish
                Sea to Fleetwood (3&#189; hours). We were again favoured with fine weather &amp; had
                a pleasant passage&#8212;it is often very rough&#8212;arriving home about 1 p.m.
                Here I found your kind p.c. of July 28<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02507_n3"/> The photos 
                of the tomb<ptr target="loc.07329_n5b"/> &amp; of yourself 
                with the other enclosures, the oak leaves &amp; a letter from Traubel all awaiting me.</p>
            <p>I am particularly pleased to have the portraits&#8212;one of

                them is quite new to me&#8212;the tomb photo has a melancholy interest 
                (it is not a photographic success&#8212;the print lacks vigour)
                &amp; I send you most hearty thanks for all.</p>
            <p>On behalf of the Bolton Whitman Church<ptr target="loc.02507_n4"/> I thank you for your loving benediction &amp; I
                daresay our beloved pastor&#8212;The Whitman apostle in Bolton&#8212;will be writing 
                to you by this mail. May it be long ere its candelabras cease to blaze!</p>
            <p>Pardon my writing more at present as I am rather busy with arrears of work</p>
