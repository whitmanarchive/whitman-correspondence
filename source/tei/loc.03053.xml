            <p>I am immensely pleased (tickled) with the result of my little Wifekin Dame Kennedy's<ptr target="loc.03053_n1"/> visit to
                you. She has read yr books &amp; Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> ever since she has
                returned. She was <hi rend="underline">finally</hi> converted by the impression made
                by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great
                magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to-day a tremendous <choice><orig>arraingment</orig><reg>arraignment</reg></choice>
                of the Leslie <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#smb">Nutler</unclear><ptr target="n5001"/> I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed
                my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England &amp;
                America) who stand up for W. W. &amp; love him she says, "Thoreau<ptr target="hun.00052_n3"/> thinks he is a great fellow, &amp; I think so, too." She says, "I saw
                with my own eyes, his nobility &amp; manners," &amp;c. She thoroughly understands and
                approves yr Children of Adam poems, too! Sees <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03053.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>their noble purpose.</p>
            <p>She doesn't <hi rend="underline">need</hi> you so much as I did, though, for she has
                always been a liberated spirit. Her father &amp; grandfather were deists.</p>
            <p>I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the
                heart of shams &amp; humbugs.
                Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital of
                some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.</p>
