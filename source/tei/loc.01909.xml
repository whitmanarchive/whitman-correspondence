                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Returning from <name>Germany</name> I found your letter of 25 Jan.
                waiting for me with many others. My first task was to write to you.</p>

            <p>'Democratic Vistas'<!-- <ptr target="n0189"/> --> has appeared in Danish translation for two
                weeks ago. I sent you myself one copy in loose sheets (to <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#km">say those</unclear> small parcels) and
                the editor has during my absence on the day of the appearance sent you two complete
                copies&#8212;one of them <hi rend="underline">unpaid</hi>, that it could be <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">sooner</unclear> to reach you. In
                    "<unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">Illustrent
                    Fodelandet</unclear>" (the people's illustrated magazine) for 22 Feb your
                likeness with a short biographical notice has been published, and the editor has
                sent you some copies. Of course all these parcels have gone to the Solicitor's
                office in <name>Washington</name>. I hope, that nevertheless the most
                of them have reached you. If not, let me know it as soon as possible, and new copies
                shall then be forwarded.</p>

            <p>"Fædrelandet" (the fatherland) brings this evening a criticism on eight columns
                on your book. You shall have the paper sent one of these days. "Fædrelandet"
                was <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">during</unclear> 30 years
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">our</unclear><!-- I can also see "are." -JS -->
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01909.002.jpg" type="verso"/> most influential
                paper, the sovereign commander of opinions. At present its luster blackens and
                darkens. From democratic and liberal it has grown conservative and anxious. As all
                what is calling itself "intellect" in <name>Denmark</name> the editor
                does not at all understand the democratic movement among the peasantry. Your book
                has been as a clenched fist in the eyes of all these people. Of course the criticism
                testifies the fact. But the <hi rend="underline">eight</hi> columns are in the eyes
                of the Danish public a great honour. The author of the criticism Rosenberg is a
                silly little fellow, who understands nothing between heaven and earth, and least of
                all, you.</p>

            <p><name type="person"><name type="person">Clemens Petersen</name></name> was in ten
                years the critic of "Fædrelandet." It has been told to me, that his essay in
                the Atlantic Monthly has had a great "success" in America. I can hardly believe it.
                It is true. It should interest me <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> to have true
                information on this point. My own opinion I wrote you in a letter the last summer. I
                hope, that you have received it. I also one time sent you a choice of Norwegian and
                Swedish poems in English translation, have you received it? With poor Clausen<!-- <ptr target="n0163"/> --> I sent you my picture. If you have not got, then <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#js">mail</unclear> it from his widow. It
                is the only one, which is resembling.</p>

            <p>The several pages which you have sent <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01909.003.jpg" type="recto"/> me I have duly received. But I did not think, that your illness
                had been so very <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#km">intense</unclear>, as now I hear.</p>

            <p>In <name>Berlin</name> I saw Bismarck. Is is worth the travel to get a
                glance on this so very <choice>
                    <sic>powerfull</sic>
                    <corr>powerful</corr>
                </choice> and so excessively beastly face. Attila called himself "God's scourge",
                    Napoleon<!-- <ptr target="n0431"/> --> did not call himself so, but he was it. But Attila
                was <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">imposing</unclear> in the
                splendour of this barbaric greatness; of Napoleon the German H. Heine<!-- <ptr target="n0297"/> --> has said "every inch a God". A scourge like this Brandenburgian
                fox hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind never has been so deeply
                fallen!</p>

            <p>I fully understand your interest for Bjornson. He is genuine, his poetry comes from
                the source that is throbbing in the people's own heat. <!-- "heart"? -al --> He has
                been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public. But he is a living test of the
                    <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km"><choice>
                        <sic>hidous</sic>
                        <corr>hideous</corr>
                    </choice></unclear> and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly head among the
                flowers of the '<hi rend="underline">pantheistic</hi>' poetry. You have in your
                "vistas" spoken proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the
                greatest lack of the present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack
                of Bjornson at the same time! Bjornson owes <name>Denmark</name>
                <hi rend="underline">gratitude</hi>. He has shown it in the form of deep and bloody
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01909.004.jpg" type="verso"/> offences, that
                make every honest Danish <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">heat</unclear><!-- might be "head"? -->
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">burn</unclear> with rage and
                indignation. I hope never to see this man, whom I have really loved, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#km">more</unclear>. At present he is in
                    <name>Italy</name> and most probably he is going to <name>America</name> in the spring to finish his moral putrification with
                dollars–gaining, handshakings and other humbug.</p>

            <p>You know too little of our relations, therefore I can tell you no more. But you will
                understand that I can forward no demand from you to Bjornson. But <name type="person">Clemens Petersen</name> was one of his "lovers" and is it still.
                If Bjornson goes to <name type="place">America</name>, he will visit Petersen. To
                    <hi rend="underline">him</hi> you can write and get said information.</p>

            <p>I have asked you at least two times how you did like <name type="person">Clemens
                    Petersen</name>; you have not replied and most probably you <choice>
                    <sic>wont</sic>
                    <corr>won't</corr>
                </choice> speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question no
                more.</p>

            <p>Hoping that these lines will find you in ameliorated state of health I am</p>
