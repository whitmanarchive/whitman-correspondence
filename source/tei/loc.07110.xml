                too much occupied to write. I got the paper you sent with the O.W. Holmes<ptr

                itself.</p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">O.W.</hi> is to all intents and purposes an Englishman (and a
                very good specimen too) Such a book as L.of G. and the mentality that goes with such
                a book is as far as possible from his ideal. The haughty, arrogant, masterful spirit

                again&#8212;of course you have said it all before (and more than once) but the
                children have not learned the lesson yet and there is no harm (even need) to
