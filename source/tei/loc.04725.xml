            </opener>
            <p>Two memorable &amp; happy days—yesterday &amp; today.  
                Your p.c. of June 30<hi rend="underline">th</hi> came to hand yesterday morning.<ptr target="loc.04725_n2"/> 
                During the morning Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> called on me &amp; gave me a copy 
                of a letter he had just received from you, dated June 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.04725_n3"/> 
                &amp; told me he had received the pictures referred to.<ptr target="loc.04725_n7"/> So I called on him in the 
                evening after leaving business to see them. I 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01274_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                was delighted to see them &amp; consider them of immense 
                interest &amp; value. Of course he gave me the duplicated copies, 
                &amp; I hope to arrange for photographic copies of two or three others 
                that I have not got. (M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Gilchrist's<ptr target="n0259"/> 
                favourite—another with the hat on<ptr target="loc.07980_n4"/>—&amp; the 
                one engraved<ptr target="loc.04725_n9"/> in the pocket book edn of L of G<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/>)</p>
            <p>Thank you heartily for your generous loving–kindness in sending them.</p>            
            <p>This morning D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. left me the proof slips 
                just received of the Lippincott<ptr target="loc.07874_n5"/> article.<ptr target="loc.04725_n5"/></p>  
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01275_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I read it at the first opportunity—after dinner &amp; somewhat hastily—to 
                return it later.—I have been looking forward eagerly to reading it, but it 
                surpasses my best anticipations. So complete &amp; full—above all so lifelike, 
                unconventional, easy, flowing, spontaneous, full of abandon, good cheer, &amp; 
                affectionate camaraderie—speeches brief &amp; pithy, but full of gems—the 
                whole to be measured &amp; read again &amp; again—destined to last for generations. 
                I have read nothing for a long time that has interested me so much.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01276_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I agree with you that "the best bits are S's,<ptr target="n0615"/> Conways,<ptr target="n0170"/> &amp; 
                Dr B's"<ptr target="n0119"/>—I consider Dr B's especially valuable—in 
                conjunction with all the rest.—It seems strange that he should have 
                taken the part of "devil's advocate," &amp; he will perhaps smile when he thinks 
                of it. But his impromptu speech—like passages of similar import in your own 
                poems—add enormously to the power &amp; value of the rest.—not a far 
                away &amp; emasculated saint <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, but a man like the rest 
                of us! And we poor devils can claim Kindred with you, &amp; draw
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01277_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                hopeful courage &amp; inspiration from your splendid 
                example—"the highest yet most human too."<ptr target="loc.04725_n8"/></p>            
            <p>In a few days we shall see D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke himself.<ptr target="loc.08168_n2d"/> 
                He will find us commonplace fellows enough, not literary 
                or clever or well informed, but affectionate friends all the same. 
                Two or three, indeed, I cannot think of without swelling pride &amp; joy 
                in having such noble manly fellows for my friends. And we love <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, 
                (though some of us don't understand half your books)
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01278_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                And it will be a lifelong pleasure to us to meet <hi rend="underline">your</hi> friend 
                &amp; our friend &amp; to talk about you. To some of us, I trust, it will be something 
                deeper &amp; better still,—a <hi rend="underline">consecration</hi> to the life 
                you have lived—an apostolic visit to the small church planted here. 
                May God's blessing rest upon his visit, &amp; his Spirit be poured out upon us.</p>            
            <p>I want to write a few lines to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> tonight, so must now close.</p>
