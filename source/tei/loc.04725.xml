                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Two memorable &#38; happy days&#8212;yesterday &#38; today.  
                Your p.c. of June 30<hi rend="underline">th</hi> came to hand yesterday morning.<ptr target="loc.04725_n2"/> 
                During the morning Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> called on me &#38; gave me a copy 
                of a letter he had just received from you, dated June 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.04725_n3"/> 
                &#38; told me he had received the pictures referred to.<ptr target="loc.04725_n7"/> So I called on him in the 
                evening after leaving business to see them. I 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01274_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                was delighted to see them &#38; consider them of immense 
                interest &#38; value. Of course he gave me the duplicated copies, 
                &#38; I hope to arrange for photographic copies of two or three others 
                that I have not got. (M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Gilchrist's<ptr target="n0259"/> 
                favourite&#8212;another with the hat on<ptr target="loc.07980_n4"/>&#8212;&#38; the 
                one engraved<ptr target="loc.04725_n9"/> in the pocket book edn of L of G<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/>)</p>
            <p>Thank you heartily for your generous loving&#8211;kindness in sending them.</p>            
            <p>This morning D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. left me the proof slips 
                just received of the Lippincott<ptr target="loc.07874_n5"/> article.<ptr target="loc.04725_n5"/></p>  
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01275_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I read it at the first opportunity&#8212;after dinner &#38; somewhat hastily&#8212;to 
                return it later.&#8212;I have been looking forward eagerly to reading it, but it 
                surpasses my best anticipations. So complete &#38; full&#8212;above all so lifelike, 
                unconventional, easy, flowing, spontaneous, full of abandon, good cheer, &#38; 
                affectionate camaraderie&#8212;speeches brief &#38; pithy, but full of gems&#8212;the 
                whole to be measured &#38; read again &#38; again&#8212;destined to last for generations. 
                I have read nothing for a long time that has interested me so much.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01276_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I agree with you that "the best bits are S's,<ptr target="n0615"/> Conways,<ptr target="n0170"/> &#38; 
                Dr B's"<ptr target="n0119"/>&#8212;I consider Dr B's especially valuable&#8212;in 
                conjunction with all the rest.&#8212;It seems strange that he should have 
                taken the part of "devil's advocate," &#38; he will perhaps smile when he thinks 
                of it. But his impromptu speech&#8212;like passages of similar import in your own 
                poems&#8212;add enormously to the power &#38; value of the rest.&#8212;not a far 
                away &#38; emasculated saint <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, but a man like the rest 
                of us! And we poor devils can claim Kindred with you, &#38; draw
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01277_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                hopeful courage &#38; inspiration from your splendid 
                example&#8212;"the highest yet most human too."<ptr target="loc.04725_n8"/></p>            
            <p>In a few days we shall see D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke himself.<ptr target="loc.08168_n2d"/> 
                He will find us commonplace fellows enough, not literary 
                or clever or well informed, but affectionate friends all the same. 
                Two or three, indeed, I cannot think of without swelling pride &#38; joy 
                in having such noble manly fellows for my friends. And we love <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, 
                (though some of us don't understand half your books)
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01278_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                And it will be a lifelong pleasure to us to meet <hi rend="underline">your</hi> friend 
                &#38; our friend &#38; to talk about you. To some of us, I trust, it will be something 
                deeper &#38; better still,&#8212;a <hi rend="underline">consecration</hi> to the life 
                you have lived&#8212;an apostolic visit to the small church planted here. 
                May God's blessing rest upon his visit, &#38; his Spirit be poured out upon us.</p>            
            <p>I want to write a few lines to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> tonight, so must now close.</p>
