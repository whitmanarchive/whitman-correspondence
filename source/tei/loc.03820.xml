                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>I hope the summer has left you tolerably well at least, your occasional postal cards
                have been a comfort. We have been having a most delightful time all to-gether. The
                chance of an advertisement brought us, family, horses, servants, and baby into this
                remote corner of Wales <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00130_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> &#38; set us down in the old house of a reduced country squire.
                It rained for a week after we came, but we lit fires &#38; unpacked our three
                volumed novels and tried to pretend that we were enjoying it. Then fortunately it
                cleared up and we began driving &#38; playing tennis, I went fishing with our
                vicar's son and soon the charm of the hills, the <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_jc.00131_large.jpg" type="recto"/> country lanes and the air made us
                very well contented with out lot. A good many of our neighbours (anyone within 12
                miles is a neighbour) have called on us &#38; have turned out to be very pleasant
                people, though their intellectual horizon is a little limited perhaps.</p>
            <p>To think of us you must imagine a spur of a healthy mountain covered with fine old
                trees, a winding carriage drive <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00132_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> through trees coming to an open space &#38; finally ending under
                the eaves of a low, many-gabled old house. Behind there is an old garden with high
                walls in the form of a square which are covered with peach and cherry trees growing
                like vines over them.</p>
            <p>I try to study in the mornings, the afternoons I give to shooting, fishing or tennis.
                Only I find that afternoons of that <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc_jc.00133_large.jpg" type="recto"/> kind have a great tendency to
                swallow up the mornings. Mariechen<ptr target="loc.03820_n2"/> and Frank Costelloe<ptr target="n6114"/> &#38; I
                however have been reading one of Sophocles' plays to-gether. Just now the Costelloes
                are off in Scotland on visit.</p>
            <p>We are just off to <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_jc.00134_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_jc.00135_large.jpg" type="recto"/> a tennis party at
                the vicar's, so good bye for the present. The paper you send Mary<ptr
                    target="loc.02189_n1"/> came to hand O.K. many thanks.</p>
