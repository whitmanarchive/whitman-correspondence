                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>All the papers have reached me&#8212;3 separate packets (with the handwriting on them that makes my heart give a glad bound). I look through them full of interest &amp; curiosity, wanting to realize as I do, in things small as well as things large my Land of Promise&#8212;the land where I hope to plant down my children&#8212;so strong in the faith that they, &amp; perhaps still more those that come after them will bless me for that (consciously or unconsciously, it doesn't matter which) that I should set out with a cheerful heart on that errand if I knew the first breath I drew on American soil, would be my last in life.

                I searched hopeful for a few words telling of improvement in your health, in the last paper. But perhaps it does not follow from there being no such mention that there is no progress. May you be steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground, my Darling! Now that I understand the nature of the malady (a deficient flow of blood to the brain if it has been rightly explained to me)<!-- <ptr target="loc.03649_n3"/> --> I realize that recovery must be very gradual: as the coming on of it must have been slow &amp; insidious. And perhaps that, &amp; also even from before the war time with its tremendous strain emotional &amp; physical &amp; is part of the price paid for the greatness of the Poems &amp; for their immortal destiny&#8212;the rapt exaltation the intensity of joy &amp; sorrow &amp; struggle&#8212;all that went to give them their life giving power.

                For I have felt many times in reading them as if the light &amp; heat of their sacred fire must needs have consumed the vital energies of him in whose breast it was generated, faster then even the most splendid physique could renew itself. For our sakes, for humanity's sake you suffer now, I do not doubt, every bit as much as the soldier's wounds are for his country's sake. The more precious the more tenderly cherished, the more drawing the hearts that understand, with ineffable yearnings for this.</p> 
                
            <p> My children all continue well in the main, I am thankful to say though Beatrice<!-- <ptr target="loc.03649_n2"/> --> (the eldest girl, looks paler than I could wish &amp; is working her brains too much &amp; the rest of her too little just at present with the hope of getting through the Apothecaries Hall exam:, in Arts next Sep. which involves a good bit of Latin and mathematics. This is all women can do in England toward getting into

                the medical profession &amp; as the Apoth; Hall certificate is accepted for the preliminary studies at Paris &amp; Zurich, I make no doubt it is also at Philadelphia &amp; New York so that she would  be able to enter on medical studies then virtual<!-- Ashley and I see "natural" but Harned has "virtual." -JS --> preliminary work when we come. For she continues steadfastly desirous to win her way into that field of usefulness &amp; I believe is well fitted to work there, with her grave earnest thoughtful feeling nature &amp; strong bodily frame. She is able to enjoy your Poems &amp; the vistas: broods over them a great deal. Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.03649_n4"/> --> is bending his energies now to mastering the processes that go to the production of the very best quality of Copper such as is used for telegraph wires &amp;c. No easy matter, copper being the most difficult, in a metallurgical point of view of all the metals to deal with &amp; the Company in whose

                employ he is having hitherto been unsuccessful in this branch. His looks, too, do not quite satisfy me:&#8212;it is partly rather too long hours of work&#8212;but still more not getting a good meal till the end of it. It is so hard to make the young believe that the stomach shares the fatigue of the rest of the body &amp; that there is not nervous energy enough left for it to do all its principal work to perfection after a long exhausting day. But I hope now I or rather his own experience &amp; I together have convinced him in time, &amp; he promises me faithfully to arrange for a good meal in the middle of the day however much grudging the time. My little artist Herby is still chiefly working from the antique, but tries his hand at home occasionally with oils &amp; to life &amp; has made an oil sketch of me which though imperfect in drawing &amp;c gives far more the real character &amp; expression

                of my face than the photographs. Have you heard, I wonder, of William Rossetti's<!-- <ptr target="loc.03649_n5"/> --> approaching marriage. It is to take place early in the New Year. The lady is Lucy Brown daughter of one of our most eminent artists (he was the friend who first put into my hand the "Selections" from your Poems). Lucy<!-- Editorial note for Lucy? --> is a very sweet-tempered cultivated lovable woman well fitted I should say to make William Rossetti happy. They are to continue in the old home Euston Sq. with Mrs. Rossetti &amp; the Sisters, who are one &amp; all fond of Lucy. I am glad he is going to be married for I think he is a man capable both of giving and receiving a large measure of domestic happiness. I hope the dear little girls at St. Louis

                are well.&#8212;And you my Darling O surely the sun is piercing through the dark clouds once more, and strength &amp; health and gladness returning. O fill yourself with happy thoughts for you have filled others with joy &amp; strength &amp; will do so for countless generations, &amp; from these hearts flows back &amp; will ever flow a steady current of love &amp; the beautiful fruits of love. </p>
