Please send me Mr &amp; Mrs. OConnor's Photograph if they will let you have them to send one.</p>
            <p>I am having first rate times here in Byron I have to work pretty hard but I dont care anything about that I am in a Dry Goods store at present there isnt any clerk but one but we expect to have more soon I have those books that you gave me yet I am a going to keep them until I see you again.</p>
            <p>There has been about a Dozen customers in since I commenced writing and I dont only barely get to writing and I have to get up so you must excuse this and I will try and do better next time. Yours Truly</p>
