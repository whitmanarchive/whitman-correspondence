Edits for the Notes

Correspondent note: write one for Hannah Whitman Heyde with her birth and death dates in the format of the W. O'C. note that I have put in as an example. link
to Whitman Encyclopedia article as follows. You only need to do this in one numbered note; then that number can be reused throughout the letters in the edition. Here is the TEI/XML for that: 

<note xml:id="n2002" resp="wwa" type="editorial">William Douglas O'Connor
                    (1832&#8211;1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
                    "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
                    available at "<ref

                        >The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</ref>"). For more on Whitman's
                    relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<ref

Corrections for notes for this letter in the notes file.
Note 1: None
Note 2: The dash in the span of years should be &#8211;. This needs to be a complete sentence, "George...was the seventh child..." Add the link to the encyclopedia entry for George
Note 3: The dashes in all spans of years should be &#8211;-->
