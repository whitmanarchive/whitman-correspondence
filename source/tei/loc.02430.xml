            <p>If all the talks of you which are heard in our family were telephoned to your ear,
                you would have daily communications from the house of Johnston.</p>
            <p>"Uncle Walt would enjoy this;" "I wish Uncle Walt could hear that;" "If Uncle Walt
                were only here," are frequent exclamations. Indeed <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02430.002.jpg" type="verso"/>you have had, since the sad event of
                thirteen years ago,<ptr target="loc.02430_n3"/> (does it seem so long?) a central place in the <hi rend="underline">heart of the home</hi> and it was there I met and welcomed
                you.</p>
            <p>Now another change is about to take place: (and who knows whether life or death is
                more momentous?) The marriage of Grace.<ptr target="n7015"/></p>
            <p>You know how lovely she is in voice and feature: but you cannot know how <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02430.003.jpg" type="recto"/>every best quality of
                her parents is mingled into a perfect whole. To me, her second mother, (by law, her
                first in devotion) she has always been a daughter indeed! Nothing could surpass the
                filial love she has given me: the confidence in my judgment: the loving obedience to
                every requirement. The aid, the encoureagement, the companionship she has given me
                since reaching the level of womanhood.</p>
            <p>It is not easy for me to give this to a man: nor easy <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02430.004.jpg" type="verso"/>for her to turn her face away from the
                sweet care-free maidenhood: leave the dear sheltered home—next the
                companionship of sisters: and take all at once wife-hood mother-hood,—the
                burden of a wealth-sustaining matron!</p>
            <p>For you have doubtless heard that the man she is to marry has both children and
                money: (burdens or blessings as we make them.) Fortunately—though without
                these qualities he would not have gained his<ptr target="loc.02430_n2"/></p>
