                        surface one (which had a printed letterhead), left the verso (surface 2) blank, completed his letter on surface three, and left the verso 
                        (surface 4) blank. Whitman then wrote his October 24, 1891, letter to the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke 
                        on the blank surface 4.</note>

            If Tuesday, November 10th.&#8212;should be a sunny day, you must give
            me the pleasure and favor of sending a carriage for you&#8212;to come to the Union 
            League,&#8212;and assist in giving honor to Mr. Jefferson and Mr.
            Florence,<ptr target="loc.03092_n1"/> the comedians.&#8212;I have asked a small party,&#8212;a 
            hand full, to luncheon to meet them,&#8212;and if you could be of the company, I should be 
            most happy.&#8212;It will be private, informal,&#8212;<hi rend="underline">under the rose</hi>,
            my desire to show two eminent &#38; worthy men, who have given the world 
            much in the way of sunshine, that they are well remembered in Philadelphia.&#8212;</p>
            <p>
            So write me that I may send

            for you.&#8212;I have not seen you since I called to take leave before departing for China.&#8212;You 
            have been much in my thoughts, ever in reverent admiration of your genius.&#8212;What a talk

                By the way, Frank Carpenter,<ptr target="loc.07893_n3"/> who painted the Lincoln proclamation of
                Emancipation, told me in New York that he wanted to paint you.&#8212;I believe he gave 
                me a commission in that regard, which I have been truant in delivering. You will I am sure
                allow me to deliver it, when you honor me as my guest on November 10&#8212;
