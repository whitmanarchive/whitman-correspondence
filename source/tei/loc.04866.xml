            <p>Your welcome letter came to hand a few weeks ago, and was pleased to hear from
                you.</p>
            <p>I am still in London making the best of every thing, &#38; I imagine, doing first

                through rain &#38; mud.</p>
            <p>I had a very good time Christmas, went home
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01319.jpg" type="verso"/> &#38; helped to eat the turkey, all my sisters &#38; brothers were there &#38; we had
                a good time. I am going to see Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> next week, also have a dance in the new Ball room. I fully intended going before this
                but kept putting it off.</p>
            <p>How did you spend Christmas. I hope well. Warren<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> is a pretty good fellow &#38; I hope
                you hang on to him for it is hard to get a young lad to take an interest in anything
                about a house, unless they are brought up<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01320.jpg" type="recto"/>

                you liked me pretty well I would have got the street for a companion long before the
                summer was over. So I made up my mind to leave in the fall &#38; go at the
                Veterinary business which I consider was a wise step</p>

            <p>You must write me often so I will know how you are getting along as I am anxious to
                know. Remember me to Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &#38; Warren,</p>
