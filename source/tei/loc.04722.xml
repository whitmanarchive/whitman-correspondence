                <salute>My dearest friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yesterday morning I received your kind postcard of the 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                inst., &#38; in the afternoon Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> received one dated the
                12<hi rend="underline">th</hi>.<ptr target="loc.04722_n2"/></p>
            <p>I am very sorry if a phrase of ours has led you to suppose that any of your letters
                or p.c.s have not been delivered. I think we have received them <hi rend="underline"
                    >all</hi>,&#8212;&#38; usually very promptly, though occasionally there is a
                curious delay like the one mentioned above.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01250.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>It is a constant wonder to us that you should write so often as you do. I feel
                sometimes that we are somehow guilty in taxing you so much. For it pains me to think
                of the effort it must cost you at times in your weakness &#38; suffering. But, oh,
                how precious your messages are!&#8212;even less for their news of you (welcomed as
                that is) than for the wonderful loving-kindness that inspires them, &#38; the
                indomitable will &#38; serene good cheer they reveal.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01251.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I wish that our letters were a better return. But after the day's work, &#38; amid
                other calls, it is not easy to write as one would like. But Johnston &#38; I have
                determined to let no mail go henceforward (if we can help it) without <hi
                    rend="underline">some</hi> reminder of our constant loving thoughts &#38;
                wishes.</p>
            <p>I am glad to note from both p.c.s that you were fairly well "considering," &#38; that
                you were standing the oppressive heat pretty well. But I long to hear some better
                news&#8212;of some <hi rend="underline">gain</hi>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01252.jpg" type="verso"/> &#38; of your
                getting out more into the open air.</p>
            <p>We look forward to the July number of Lippincotts<ptr target="loc.04722_n3"/> &#38;
                will get copies as soon as it appears.</p> 
            <p>We have had close sultry weather for 2 or 3 days with rain &#38; thunder storms in
                the evenings. Tonight, however, is pretty fair, with only occasional very slight
                showers. As I write the dusk is closing in, &#38; a lark is singing out in the field
                opposite my window. I cannot write any more tonight.&#8212;I send <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01253.jpg" type="recto"/> love to
