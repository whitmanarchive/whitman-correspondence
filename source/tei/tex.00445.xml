                <salute>Dear Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>You will believe that I received with pride and warm feeling the
                love which you sent me in a letter to Gilchrist,<ptr target="n0262"/> now published
                in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>; and that I reciprocate your love with
                reverential affection.<ptr target="tex.00445_n1"/></p>
            <p>That movement for a few English people to express in a practical form the feeling
                which they entertain towards you has not as yet taken any extended
                development&#8212;nothing I believe having been done outside a few general
                paragraphs in journals. Gilchrist will now be taking steps in a more detailed and
                direct way: from him and his mother<ptr target="n0259"/> you will no doubt hear many
                particulars from time to time.</p>
            <p>The sums which have as yet come into my hands as Treasurer are &#163;22.2.6. I beg to
                forward this amount in the within form&#8212;being
            <list>
                <item>1. 3 Post-Office orders which will be made good to you upon your signing them,
                    and presenting them at Camden&#8212;and</item>
                <item>2. A Brank-draft which, as I am advised, you can get cashed in Camden or
                    Philadelphia.</item>
            </list>
            The draft comes from Charles Aldrich,<ptr target="med.00763_n1"/> of Webster City,
                Iowa, who had an interview with you some months ago, and wrote me several
                interesting details about it. Indeed Mr. Aldrich's letter was the immediate
                incentive and opportunity for Mrs. Gilchrist and the rest of us to bestir ourselves,
                and see who among us would honour himself by associating his name in this small way
                with yours.</p>
            <p>I enclose a little list of names, and remain, like so many others who have hearts to
                feel and ears to hear,</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Your lifelong debtor,</salute>
