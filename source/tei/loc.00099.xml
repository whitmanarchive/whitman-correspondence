                <salute>My dear Mr Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I thank you for your thoughtfulness in sending me the Atlantic with your glorious poem which has 
                caught up the grandeur &#38; harmony of the Cretian itself.<ptr target="n5002d"/></p>
            <p>I hope you will take the Crusades in hand in reference to Crete &#38; the contest betwixt Christian

            <p>A grand subject worthy of your genius! a gathering of natives as shining &#38; wild
                as that now tossing about in these States, all bent on driving the Turks &#38;
                Saracens from Christian land. Popes, Kings, Emperors, he of France the sainted Louis
                IX<ptr target="n0369"/> &#38; the English monarch Richard Coeur de Lion<ptr target="n0507"/>,

                the flower of the nobility, all armed to the teeth, armor-clad with no thought but hatred to the

                but then mere thousands of sailors; the ships of Venice, Genoa &#38; Spain &#38;
                behold the result! While their ships were crossexamining Mediterranean &#38; Aegean
                sea to find the best harbour wherein to lay hand on Turk they became acquainted with
                navigation, <hi rend="underline">with the art of navigation!</hi></p>
            <p>The spirit of maritime <hi rend="underline">discovery</hi> was thus <hi rend="underline">initiated by 
                these crusading fleets,</hi> &#38; when this spirit had culminated in the discovery of America, then 
                Crusading spirit <hi rend="underline">dies out</hi> &#38; trading spirit, venturesome, engendering
                negro-traffic, was ushered <hi rend="underline">into existence</hi>.</p>
            <p>Hence the poet is right to conclude that the Enterprise which originated in Christian Enthusiasm, was 
                killed by the spirit of maritime discovery to which it had given birth</p>
            <p>If the Genoese &#38; Spanish sailors had not been experimenting on the sea in the Crusading expeditions, 
                the best of discovery would not have been developed; Columbus would not have been incited to his expedition 
                &#38; America would not have been discovered.</p>
            <p>And then the poetry that was born by the Crusades. Tasso's <hi rend="underline">Gerusalemme Liberata</hi><ptr target="n0257"/> 
                &#38; Goethe's drama, Torquato Tasso with his poetic love of Princess Eleonora.<ptr target="n0484"/> 
                And the chivalry, the heroic, martial spirit; the martyr; the Christ spirit the millions of Christians 
                slain in the attempt to wrest the sepulchre from Turk.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.00099.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>You see the connection. The discovery of America was the indirect result of the Crusading expeditions. 
                But the spirit of Enterprise crushed that of religious enthusiasm &#38; thus it was that the Turk was 
                allowed to remain to oppress Crete &#38; Greece &#38; now America repays the debt which it owes to the 
                poor Christians of the East whose dream was sealed because America had to be discovered &#38; a maelstrom 
                of material Enterprise to be let loose</p>
            <p>How grandly you might weave all this together in words &#38; mankind&#8212;stirring stanzas! Ponder over it 
                &#38; if I can make further suggestions, let me know</p>

                    <l>Full two hundred years before Columbus came</l>
                    <l>The way to his advent was clearly traced</l>
                    <l>By the armadas thronged with Crusaders</l>
                    <l>Who drove the <choice><orig>Moslem</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> from the land of Christ.</l>
                    <l>While all Christian men &#38; women too seized the pilgrim's staff</l>
                    <l>To wrest the hallowed East from Turkish grasp</l>
                    <l>Thrilled only with the Sermon on the Mount</l>
                    <l>and caring not for tracing hidden empires</l>
                    <l>It so happened that their wrestlings with the seas</l>
                    <l>opened new vistas to ships &#38; <hi rend="underline">the art of</hi> navigation.</l>
                    <l>Genoa, Venice &#38; Spain were most busy on that craft</l>
                    <l>Their swift sailors spread dismay in <choice><orig>Moslem</orig><reg>Muslim</reg></choice> camps</l>
                    <l>Even as in these days the <choice><orig>Syran</orig><reg>Syrian</reg></choice> Candiot sloops</l>
                    <l>But mark! this sea alliance of Italy &#38; Spain</l>
                    <l>Stretches far beyond the Saviour's tomb</l>
                    <l>Columbus was its immaculate conception</l>
                    <l>and a new world thus linked with old Palestine</l>
                </lg></p>
                <p><lg>
                    <l>Peter the Hermit &#38; Walter the Penniless little dreamt</l>
                    <l>That their rhapsodies would give a lift to sailors</l>
                    <l>and wings to the cross-examiners of the sea</l>
                    <l>Until the Genoese struck upon these shores</l>
                    <l>To communicate this mystic bond between East &#38; West</l> 
                    <l>which the <choice><sic>Voge's</sic><corr>Vosges</corr></choice> &#38; Castilian
                        fleets<ptr target="n0144"/> had initiated in olden times</l>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.00099.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    <l>Alas! greed soon followed in the train of enterprise</l>
                    <l>The crusaders degenerated into traders</l>
                    <l>The Turk desecrated the tomb of Christ</l>
                    <l>and built his Harems in the Holy Virgin's land.</l>
                </lg></p>
                <p><lg>
                    <l>New centuries have since come &#38; gone</l>
                    <l>But the old bond between East &#38; West survives</l>
                    <l>When Arcade fell with thousand Christian martyrs</l>
                    <l>&#38; Men &#38; women gave their mete to Crete</l>
                    <l>Then the old bond revives with all its mystic charm.</l>
                    <l>Pilgrim Rock &#38; Calvary, Crusaders &#38; Columbus</l>
                    <l>and all the chivalric, holy trinity of them get revived</l>
                    <l>To do in our days &#38; in our quiet way</l>
                    <l>What was done of yore in turmoil &#38; confusion</l>
                    <l>So great is the result of the Genoese's adventure</l>
                    <l>That our influence transcends all the armies of all the Crusaders</l>
                    <l>Let us pay the debt we owe to these great souls</l>
                    <l>Where monarched Europe failed, let free Columbia win.</l>
                    <l>Let our nation give the honour of fellowship to Crete</l>
                    <l>To Crete delivered from the Turkish yoke</l>
                    <l>And by a divine law of gravitation</l>
                    <l>They consummate the work in which Saint Louis was foiled.</l>
