                <salute>My dear Mr Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I thank you for your thoughtfulness in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">rendering</unclear><!-- there are not enough words, it appears, to spell "rendering" here -NNK -->
                me the Atlantic with your glorious poem which has caught up the grandeur &amp;
                harmony of the Cretian itself.</p>
            <p>I hope you will take the Crusades in hand in reference to Crete &amp; the contest
                betwixt Christian &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Mussalman</unclear>
                <!-- Is this maybe a mispelling of Muslims: "Musilms"? -al [I changed this from "Muslim" to "Mussalman," which is the proper rendering of the term (especially when transliterated from native tongues) -NNK] -->.</p>

            <p>A grand subject worthy of true genius! A gathering of natures as shining &amp; wild
                as that now tossing about in these States, all bent on driving the Turks &amp;
                Saracens from Christian land. Popes, Kings, Emperors, he of France the sainte Louis
                IX &amp; the English monarch Richard Coeur de Lion<!-- <ptr target="n0507"/> -->, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">Martinus</unclear>

                the nobility, all armed to the teeth, armor-clad with no thought but hatred to the
                Turk &amp; love for Christ &amp; for Womanhood, which the Turk defiles. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">Immense</unclear>
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">Caravanserais</unclear>
                <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#br">slacking</unclear> from all lands,
                for several centuries, <gap extent="one word"/> by rapt men&#8212;Peter the
                Hermit<!-- <ptr target="n0465"/> -->, Walter the Pennyless<!-- <ptr target="n0679"/> -->, all classes joining, all
                races, all ages; children's crusades; eighty thousand children <hi rend="underline">En</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">route</hi> for Holy Land; rabble; loafers; religious &amp;
                otherwise <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">join</unclear>;
                thieves; prostitutes; all; high &amp; low, virtuous &amp; vicious, all humanity on
                horseback! But mark <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.00099.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                but then mere thousands of sailors; the ships of Venice, Genoa &amp; Spain &amp;
                behold the result! While their ships were crossexamining Mediterranean &amp; Aegean
                sea to find the best harbour wherein to lay hand on Turk they became acquainted with
                navigation, <hi rend="underline">with the art of <choice>
                        <abbr>navigatg</abbr>
                        <expan>navigating</expan>
                    </choice></hi></p>

            <p>The spirit of maritime <hi rend="underline">discovery</hi> was thus <hi rend="underline">initiated by these crusading fleets,</hi> &amp; when this
                spirit had culminated in the discovery of America, then Crusading spirit <hi rend="underline">dies out</hi> &amp; trading spirit, venturesome, engendering
                negro-traffic, was ushered <hi rend="underline">into existence</hi>.</p>

            <p>Hence the poet is right to conclude that the Enterprise which originated in Christian
                Enthusiasm, was killed by the spirit of maritime discovery to which it had given
                birth</p>
            <p>If the Genoese &amp; Spanish sailors had not been experimenting on the sea in the
                Crusading expeditions, the best of discovery <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">would</unclear> not have been developed; Columbus would
                not have been incited to his expedition &amp; America would not have been
                discovered.</p>

            <p>And then the poetry that was born by the Crusades. Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata<!-- <ptr target="n0256"/> -->, &amp; Goethe's drama, Torquato Tasso with his poetic love of
                Princess Eleonora<!-- <ptr target="n0484"/> -->. And the chivalry, the heroic, martial
                spirit; the martyr; the Christ spirit the millions of Christians slain in the
                attempt to wrest the sepulchre from Turk.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.00099.009.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>You see the connection. The discovery of America had the excellent
                <!--This might be "excellect," but it looks more something like "indir..." (maybe "indirect")?  But I'm not changing it because I can't find a better suggestion -al-->
                result of the Crusading expeditions. But the spirit of Enterprise crushed that of
                religious entusiasm &amp; thus it was that the Turk was allowed to remain to oppress
                Crete &amp; Greece &amp; now America repays the debt which it owes to the poor
                Christians of the East whose dream was sealed because America had to be discovered
                &amp; a maelstrom of material Enterprise to be let loose</p>
            <p>How grandly you might weave all this together in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#br">words</unclear> &amp; mankind-stirring stanzas! Ponder
                over it &amp; if I can make further suggestions, let me know</p>

                <p>To wrest the hallowed East from Turkish grasp

                <p>The Turk descecrated the tomb of Christ and built his harem in the Holy Virgin's

                <p>Which was done of yore in turmoil &amp; confusion</p>
                <p>So great is the result of the Genoen's adventure</p>
                <p>That our influence transcend all the armies of all the Crusaders</p>
                <p>Let us pay the debt we owe to these great souls</p>
                <p>Where monarched Europe failed, let free Columbia win.</p>
