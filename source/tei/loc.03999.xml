            </opener>
            <p>The spirit moves me to scribble off a few lines to you—but I don't know why,
                for I have no news to tell &amp; nothing particular to write about any how. I
                returned to-day from a three days visit to my Quaker friends at
                Germantown—they have tip top horses &amp; carriage, &amp; we had good long
                drives Saturday afternoon &amp; Sunday towards evening after the rain—After
                supper, &amp; the things are removed, we all sit around the table we sometimes keep
                it up an hour &amp; a half &amp; have a good talk &amp; discussions, &amp; accounts
                of any thing that has occurred during the day, &amp; somebody has questions to put
                or information to glean,—perhaps some little recitation or singing, a good lot
                of us—eight or nine altogether—there are two just grown daughters, as
                nice and jolly and 'cute as young women can be—one son—&amp; always
                three or four others—making a good time <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00210_large.jpg" type="verso"/> Sunday morning, they have family
                prayers—I was requested to read a chapter from the testament—(the Sermon
                on the Mount)—<hi rend="underline">which I did</hi>—(I wish you could
                have all seen &amp; heard me)—I never beheld such a merry, affectionate,
                hearty healthy family—<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">nobby</unclear>, too—</p>
            <p>—With me, this fall, everything just floats idly along, as far as writing and work are
                concerned—Down there at Ocean Grove and along Barnegat &amp;c. I was moved to
                write a poem <hi rend="underline">on the ocean</hi><ptr target="loc.03999_n1"/>—I have turned it &amp; turned it &amp; rewritten it over &amp; over
                again—but cant get it to suit me yet—Harry, how is it with you? &amp;
                why <choice>

            <p>—I am about as usual—I am writing this after 9 at night up in my room, sitting
