            <p>The spirit moves me to scribble off a few lines to you&#8212;but I don't know why,
                for I have no news to tell &#38; nothing particular to write about any how. I
                returned to-day from a three days visit to my Quaker friends at
                Germantown&#8212;they have tip top horses &#38; carriage, &#38; we had good long
                drives Saturday afternoon &#38; Sunday towards evening after the rain&#8212;After
                supper, &#38; the things are removed, we all sit around the table we sometimes keep
                it up an hour &#38; a half &#38; have a good talk &#38; discussions, &#38; accounts
                of any thing that has occurred during the day, &#38; somebody has questions to put
                or information to glean,&#8212;perhaps some little recitation or singing, a good lot
                of us&#8212;eight or nine altogether&#8212;there are two just grown daughters, as
                nice and jolly and 'cute as young women can be&#8212;one son&#8212;&#38; always
                three or four others&#8212;making a good time <pb xml:id="leaf001v"

                prayers&#8212;I was requested to read a chapter from the testament&#8212;(the Sermon

            <p>&#8212;With me, this fall, everything just floats idly along, as far as writing and work are
                concerned&#8212;Down there at Ocean Grove and along Barnegat &#38;c. I was moved to
                write a poem <hi rend="underline">on the ocean</hi><ptr target="loc.03999_n1"
                />&#8212;I have turned it &#38; turned it &#38; rewritten it over &#38; over
