            <p>Both your letters have been received, Lewy<ptr target="loc.00886_n2"/>&#8212;the second one came this morning, &amp; was welcome, as any thing from you will always be, &amp; the sight of your face welcomer than all, my darling&#8212;I see you write in good spirits, &amp; appear to have first-rate times&#8212;Lew, you must not go around too much, nor eat &amp; drink too promiscuous, but be careful &amp; moderate, &amp; not let the kindness of friends carry you away, lest you break down again, dear son&#8212;I was at the hospital yesterday four or five hours, was in ward K&#8212;Taber<ptr target="loc.00886_n3"/> has been down sick, so he had to lay abed, but he is better now, &amp; goes around as usual&#8212;Curly<ptr target="loc.00886_n4"/> is the same as usual&#8212;most of the others are the same&#8212;there have been quite a good many deaths&#8212;the young man who lay in bed 2 with a very bad leg is dead&#8212;I saw Johnny Mahay<ptr target="loc.00886_n5"/> in ward E&#8212;poor fellow, he is very poorly, he is very thin, &amp; his face is like wax&#8212;Lew, I must tell you what a curious thing happened in the chaplain's<ptr target="loc.00886_n6"/> house night before last&#8212;there has been a man in ward I, named Lane, with two fingers amputated, very bad with gangrene, so they removed him to a tent by himself&#8212;last Thursday his wife came to see him, she seemed a nice woman but very poor, she stopt at the chaplain's&#8212;about 3 o'clock in the morning she got up &amp; went to the sink, &amp; there she gave birth to a child, which fell down the sink into the sewer runs beneath, fortunately the water was not turned on&#8212;the chaplain got up, carried Mrs Lane out, &amp; then roused up a lot of men from the hospital, with spades &amp;c. dug a trench outside, &amp; got into the sink, &amp; took out the poor little child, it lay there on its back, in about two inches of water&#8212;well, strange as it may seem, the child was alive, (it fell about five feet through the sink)&#8212;&amp; is now living &amp; likely to live, is quite bright, has a head of thick black hair&#8212;the chaplain took me in yesterday, showed me the child, &amp; Mrs Jackson, his wife, told me the whole story, with a good deal I havn't told you&#8212;&amp; then she treated me to a good plate of ice cream&#8212;so I staid there nearly an hour &amp; had quite a pleasant visit. Mrs Lane lay in an adjoining room.</p>
            <p>Lew, as to me &amp; my affairs there is nothing very new or important&#8212;I have not succeeded in getting any employment here yet, except that I write a little (newspaper correspondence &amp;c), barely enough to pay my expenses&#8212;but it is my own fault, for I have not tried hard enough for any thing&#8212;the last three weeks I have not felt very well&#8212;for two or three days I was down sick, for the first time in my life, (as I have never before been sick)&#8212;I feel pretty fair to-day&#8212;I go around most every day the same as usual. I have some idea of giving myself a furlough of three or four weeks, &amp; going home to Brooklyn, N Y, but I should return again to Washington, probably. Lew, it is pretty hot weather here, &amp; the sun affects me&#8212;(I had a sort of sun stroke about five years ago)&#8212;You speak of being here in Washington again about the last of August&#8212;O Lewy, how glad I should be to see you, to have you with me&#8212;I have thought if it could be so that you, &amp; one other person &amp; myself could be where we could work &amp; live together, &amp; have each other's society, we three, I should like it so much&#8212;but it is probably a dream&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, Lew, they had the great battle of Gettysburgh, but it does not seem to have settled any thing, except to have killed &amp; wounded a great many thousand men&#8212;It seems as though the two armies were falling back again to near their old positions on the Rappahannock&#8212;it is hard to tell what will be the next move&#8212;yet, Lewy, I think we shall conquer yet&#8212;I don't believe it is destined that this glorious Union is to be broken up by all the secesh south, or copheads north either&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, my darling, I have scribbled you off something to show you where I am &amp; that I have rec'd your welcome letters&#8212;but my letter is not of much interest, for I don't feel very bright to-day&#8212;Dear son, you must write me whenever you can&#8212;take opportunity when you have nothing to do, &amp; write me a good long letter&#8212;your letters &amp; your love for me are very precious to me, for I appreciate it all, Lew, &amp; give you the like in return. It is now about 3 o'clock, &amp; I will go out &amp; mail this letter, &amp; then go &amp; get my dinner&#8212;So good bye, Lewy&#8212;good bye, my dear son &amp; comrade, &amp; I hope it will prove God's will that you get quite well &amp; sound yet, &amp; have many good years yet&#8212;</p>
