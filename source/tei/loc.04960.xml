                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your kind post-card of Sept. 30<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04960_n1"/> 
                rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> on the 11<hi rend="underline">th</hi> inst, and 
                the pocket-book copy of
                L. of G.<ptr target="med.00869_n1"/> received this morning. Many thanks.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear of the visit from John Burroughs,<ptr target="n0129"/> which I know
                would be a very great pleasure to you both. He told D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    J.<ptr target="n4102"/> that he wished very much that he could persuade you to
                    <hi rend="underline">live</hi> near him.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02187.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston tells me that a friend of ours, &amp; a
                school-fellow of mine,—Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/>—is likely to call upon you. He has been
                spending a little time in Canada, &amp; wrote home that he would return by New York, 
                &amp; would probably go on to Camden to see you. D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. sent you
                a telegram to that effect last week. I understand, however, that he is likely to
                have left America before this reaches you.<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02188.jpg" type="recto"/> I spent 3 days in Yorkshire last
                week—so ending my holiday.—I am by no means so much
                    recruited in health as I
                expected, but hope to improve gradually as time goes on.</p>
            <p>The weather here is broken—two or three days of fair weather alternating with a
                few days of rain. Fairly warm so far, getting colder at nights.</p>
            <p>Looking through some old papers the other day I came across a cutting from the "<hi rend="underline">Sunday Chronicle</hi>"<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02189.jpg" type="verso"/> dated Feb 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                1887. Probably you have not seen it, and I think I will enclose it. It is of very
                slight value but is interesting because of its source—the S. C. having a large
                circulation amongst the working classes here &amp; being very radical &amp; heterodox in
                character.—It pays you the left-handed compliment of professing to employ a
                "Walt Whitman Junior" on its staff, whose verses often appear but do no credit to
                the name!</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston seems in good health now &amp; very busy.</p>
            <p>I hope that the "grippe" has now left you, &amp;, with love &amp; best wishes always,
                remain</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
