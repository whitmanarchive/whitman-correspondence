            <p>Two papers have come to hand since I last wrote; one containing the memoranda made
                during the war<!-- Annotation? -->&#8212;precious records, eagerly read &amp;
                treasured &amp; reread by me. </p>

            <p>How the busy days slip by, one so like another, yet each with its own fresh &amp;
                pleasant flavor &amp; scent, as like and as different as the leaves on a tree, or
                the plants in the hedgerows.</p>
            <p>Days they are busy with humble enough occupations, but lit up for me not only with
                the light of hope, but with the half–hidden joy of one who knows she has found
                what she sought and laid <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">such strong hold</supplied> upon it that she fears nothing, questions
                nothing,&#8212;no life, or death, nor, in the end, in her own imperfections, flaws,
                shortcomings. For to be <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02876.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <!-- The microfilm image of this verso is poor and often hard to read. -al --> so
                conscious of these, and to love and understand you so, are proofs <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned">that</supplied>
                <!-- "that" was originally in brackets, so I assume that Harned supplied the word himself.  But I didn't think we'd want to leave it that way, as it wouldn't meant the same thing within the context of our project.  But I'm not sure if this is the best way either. -al -->
                the germs <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">of all are in
                    her, &amp;</supplied> perhaps in the warmth &amp; <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">joyous</supplied> sunshine of your presence would
                grow fast. Anyhow, distance has not <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">baffled her, and time will not.</supplied> A great
                deal of needlework to be done at this time of year; for my girls have not time for
                any at present; it is not a good contrast <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">or the right thing after longish</supplied> hours
                of study&#8212;much better household <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">activity of</supplied> any sort. If they would but
                understand this in schools &amp; colleges for girls &amp; young women! No healthier
                or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study, could be found than household
                work&#8212;sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing, cooking&#8212;in the variety of
                it, &amp; equable development of the muscles, I should think equal to the most
                elaborate gymnastics. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02874.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I know very well how I have felt, &amp; still feel the want of having been put to
                these things when a girl. Then the importance afterwards of doing them easily &amp;
                well &amp; without undue fatigue, to all who aim to give practical shape to their
                ardent belief in equality &amp; fair play for all! In domestic life under one roof,
                at all events it is already feasible to make the disposals without ignominious
                distinctions,&#8212;not all the rough bodily work never ending, still begining; and
                the mental culture and abundant leisure all to the other&#8212;but a wholesome
                interchange and sharing of these. Not least too among the advantages of taking an
                active share in these <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02876.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                duties is the zest, the keen relish it gives to the hours not too easily secured for
                reading &amp; music. Besides, I often think that just as the Poem Nature is made up
                half of rude, rough realities &amp; homely materials &amp; processes, so it is
                necessary for women to construct their <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">Poem, Home,</supplied> on a groundwork of
                homeliest details &amp; occupations providing for the bodily wants &amp; comforts of
                their household, and that without putting their own hands to this, their Poem will
                lack the vital fresh growing nature-like quality that alone endures, and that of
                this soil will grow, with fitting <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02874.005.jpg" type="recto"/> preparation &amp; culture a noble &amp; more vigorous
                intellectual life in women, fit to embody itself in wider spheres
                afterwards&#8212;if the call comes. </p>

            <p>This month of May that comes to you so laden with great and sorrowful &amp; beautiful
                &amp; tender memories, and that is your birth month too, I cannot say that I think
                of you more than at any other time, for there is no month nor day that my thoughts
                do not habitually &amp; spontaneously turn to you, refer all to you; yet I seem to
                come closer, because of the Poems that tell me of what relates to that time; but
                most of all when I think of your beloved Mother,<!-- <ptr target="loc.02876_n1"/> --> because then I
                often yearn, more than I <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02876.006.jpg" type="verso"/>

                    bear,</supplied> to comfort you with love and tender care and silent
                companionship. <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">May is in
                    a</supplied> sense <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">(&amp; a very real one) my birth</supplied> month too, for in it were <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">your Poems</supplied> first put

                move about without effort or difficulty&#8212;perhaps before long there will be a
                paper with some paragraph about your health, for though <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">we say to ourselves</supplied> no news is good
                news, it is a very different thing to <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">have the</supplied> absolute <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">affirmation of good</supplied>
                news. </p>

                industriously. Grace<!-- <ptr target="loc.02876_n2"/> --> means to study the best system of Kinder

            <p>Herby<!-- <ptr target="loc.02876_n3"/> --> is still drawing from the antique in the
                British Museum. I hope he will get into the Academy this summer. He is going

                their honeymoon at Naples? <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&amp; have found it bitterly</supplied>
