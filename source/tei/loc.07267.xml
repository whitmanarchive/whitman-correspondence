            <p>Your welcome letter conveying the good news that you are "feeling better still" is
                just to hand. You will have got mine before now telling you I had heard from Wm Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> &#38; that all was O.K., there
                was a line yesterday from him to Matilda Gurd<ptr target="n6145"/> but nothing special in it. All is
                right but move slower than we figured on. I am real glad you seem pleased with Ed 
                W.<ptr target="n4319"/> I knew he would suit you or I would not have sent him so far&#8212;he was with me
                here a long time and I know him well&#8212;he is just what he looks a good, simple
                minded, quiet, honest country boy&#8212;just the kind you like. (A note just came
                from Wm Gurd&#8212;all well but not yet able<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_es.00461.jpg" type="verso"/> to fix a date for me to
                go East). Yes I got the Phila "Times" 27 Oct. only a
                middling notice&#8212;it is suprising to me how little the average reviewer
                sees&#8212;not one of them seem to have the lest idea what you have been driving at
                this last 35 years&#8212;guess it will come all right in the end. Rolleston<ptr
                    target="n1027"/> has sent me a copy of his Epictetus (Camelot Series)<ptr
                    target="loc.07267_n2"/>&#8212;it is exactly what I wanted I have been looking it
                over and am delighted with it. Have not yet written to thank him, shall very soon. I
                guess you are going to make more of a recovery than any of the doctors
                suspected&#8212;they did not allow enough for that wonderfull physique of
                yours&#8212;I wish Pardee<ptr target="n4274"/> &#38; O'Connor<ptr
                    target="n2002"/> were making as good a flight&#8212;have heard nothing from
                either of them for some days.<ptr target="loc.07267_n3"/></p>
