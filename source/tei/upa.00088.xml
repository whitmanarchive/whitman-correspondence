            <p>Yours of the 10th came to-day &amp; is welcome. Every thing goes on much the same
                here. Quite biting wintry cold to-day after a long stormy spell. I am ab't the same
                as when you were here—&amp; am sitting by the window in the big chair. Mrs.
                    D<ptr target="n6113"/> is well. We have been feasting on some nice stewed
                quinces and quince jelly—a triumph of Mrs. D's cookery—we wish you were
                here to have some—the very color goes beyond all description. I have no doubt
                the portrait fully justifies all encomiums there, and goes beyond them.<ptr target="upa.00088_n1"/> —In a good light &amp; in a frame it must indeed
                appear well—having <hi rend="underline">neither</hi> here, &amp; intentionally
