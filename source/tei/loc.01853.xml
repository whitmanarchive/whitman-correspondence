                facts, thoughts, perhaps

                not for you, but <hi rend="underline">for myself</hi>, is the <hi rend="underline">motive</hi>, as this is 
                (forenoon of Monday, May 8,) a day when the fields are too much <hi rend="underline">soaked with rain</hi> 
                for out-door farming business, and the man is <hi rend="underline">lonesome</hi>. (Now, if there were living
                near me, <hi rend="underline">such people</hi> that I could take my Walt Whitman books with me, and by reading
                to them, or having them read for themselves, see them jump up and shout "glory, glory, hallelujah" like the

                <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/> I could pass the day well. But it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/> 
                so much different <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/> I am a poor, <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/>—as
                for styling myself "philosopher," I will <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/> that, and let you see whether you 
                have guessed well if you have taken interest in the matter enough to <hi rend="underline">be

                <hi rend="underline">nom de plume</hi>—sometimes when I am talking to myself I use the title—also 
                some years ago when I saw in a newspaper mention of a character (perhaps), a "J.N. the Philosopher" I thought 
                it might be some one's mischief concerning myself on account of <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> 
                methodical, systematic manner in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">conversations and eccentricity</unclear>

                they might fall into wrong hands, and being so frank or communicative—you see—</p>
            <p>Possibly, possibly, you will like to know how I like your new issues.<ptr target="loc.01235_n1"/> It does me great good to see the 
                <hi rend="underline">full length</hi> <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/>—a very proper embellishment 
                <gap reason="deletion" extent="unk"/> a work, almost <hi rend="underline">convincing</hi>

                <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/>)—the intercalations are good—I judge the new issue 
                was printed from <hi rend="underline">old plates</hi> still in your possession (printing and mis-printing 
                all the same). How much would it cost to print for me about 6 copies of the full-length picture?</p>            
            <p>When the two books came to the post-office, I read to the P.M., an old man of large body, brain, and general 
                solidity, and a consistent Union man, the "Song of the Banner at Day-Break"—it
                <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to please him powerfully.</p>     
            
            <p>I tell you Kosmos! "the Philosopher" is a fine reader—voice a little husky and nasal at times, and 
                teeth awful bad, but the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering as farther back than lips or teeth. 
                If I were a rich man I would print in great, big type, that <hi rend="underline">Song</hi>, for 
                wide distribution at the Centennial,<ptr target="n0435"/> and if you pestered me about infringement of copy-right, I would pull your beard.</p>   
            
            <p>In "Two Rivulets" I see nothing but what is good.</p> 
            
            <p>The Passage to India<ptr target="n0465"/> and the Strong Bird<ptr target="n0746b"/> &amp;c were not new to 
                me—I had them before. Democratic Vistas<ptr target="n4122"/> was new—thinking 
                of <hi rend="underline">lending the book</hi> among the most suitable people around me (people perhaps 
                too poor to buy for themselves, or at least not disposed,) I have <hi rend="underline">marked</hi> about 
                <hi rend="underline">one</hi><gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/> in passing of Vistas as condensed

                a good deal in other places—your books <choice><abbr>tho'</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> are bad

            <p>I wish you would sometime take up Democratic Vistas (for me) and read (Conscience) Page 62 and then bottom of 
                Page 69—please read <hi rend="underline">all</hi> of it (<hi rend="underline">for me</hi>). All of Dem Vistas.</p>           
           
            <p>Concerning <hi rend="underline">that Exposition</hi>, and people coming or <hi rend="underline">not</hi> coming 
                to it. I see that I can get (or have) the means to come and pay <hi rend="underline">my</hi> own way, first and
                last. As a matter of <hi rend="underline">policy</hi>, here are considerations. A man with a large family, 
                in resolving to spend, ought to think not merely of his <hi rend="underline">principal</hi>, 
                but of his <hi rend="underline">income</hi>; think of the easiness, or the <hi rend="underline">difficulty</hi> 
                and <hi rend="underline">slowness</hi> of <hi rend="underline">replacing</hi> what he may spend. The principle 
                of <hi rend="underline">self-denial</hi> and paternal solicitude says for me to consider what good can I make it
                do my family if I make that visit to Phila.?</p>    
            
            <p>Under some circumstances it may do much good—they wish me to do so—I might please them a great deal 
                by <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">the</unclear> relation of what I should 
                see—<gap reason="deletion" extent="unk"/>nd the ve<gap reason="deletion" extent="unk"/> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">instruct</unclear>

                them, give all a taste for reading, and in time "elevated sentiments". Of course the crowding, and 
                <gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/>ing and multitude of sights and sounds would  
                <gap reason="deletion" extent="one word"/> a wild man very much, and he might not 
                <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> a distinct remembrance of any considerable
                part. S<gap reason="deletion" extent="unk"/> would make kept and freely use<gap reason="illegible" extent="unk"/></p> 
            <p>I know under favorable <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">conditions</unclear> the chance to 
                see and talk with (just, lone, solitary) Walt Whitman would be half of my pleasure. And again, if I could
                write, speak, act, or look so as to win any considerable bit of kind notice, or useful suggestions from you, 
                I know it would afford a great pleasure certainly, and <hi rend="underline">perhaps</hi> be a valuable 
                <hi rend="underline">moral stimulant</hi> and elevator to the family. Put this against the outlay. 
                I wish to find the best book for them, and to inspire them with pride, that they may be worthy wife and 
                children of a home-made <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="medium">Philosopher</unclear>.</p>            
            <p>All stubbornly at my own expense. As I write this, I am <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aja" cert="medium">not
            disposed</unclear> to come there. 
                I swear I <choice><orig>wont</orig><reg>won't</reg></choice> if you say I shall not see you,</p>            
            <p><hi rend="underline">But if</hi> I could come at my convenient time, and hire lodging close to Walt, and step
                in for a week at your convenient times, and beard the (reticent) lion in his den, and make him give me a great 
                deal of information and <hi rend="underline">good advice</hi>, it might pay us here finely.</p>
