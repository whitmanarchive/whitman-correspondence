            <p>When the two books came to the post-office, I read to the P.M., an old man of large body, brain, and general solidity, and a consistent Union man, the "Song of the Banner at Day-Break"&#8212;it <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to please him powerfully.</p>

            <p>In "Two Rivulets" I see nothing but what is good.</p>
            <p>The Passage to India and the Strong Bird &amp;c were not new to me&#8212;I had them before.

            <p>I wish you would sometime take up Democratic Vistas (for me)and read (Conscience) Page 62 and then bottom of Page 69&#8212;please read <hi rend="underline">all</hi> of it (<hi rend="underline">for me</hi>). All of Dem Vistas.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi rend="underline">that Exposition</hi>, and people coming or <hi rend="underline">not</hi> coming to it, I see that I can get (or have) the means to come and pay <hi rend="underline">my</hi> own <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">way</unclear>, first and last. As a matter of <hi rend="underline">policy</hi>, here <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">is considerations</unclear>. A man with a large family, in resolving to spend, ought to think not merely of his <hi rend="underline">principal</hi>, but of his <hi rend="underline">income</hi>; think of the easiness, or the <hi rend="underline">difficulty</hi> and <hi rend="underline">slowness</hi> of <hi rend="underline">replacing</hi> what he may spend. The principle of <hi rend="underline">self-denial</hi> and paternal solicitude says for me to consider what good can I make it do my family if I make that visit to <choice><orig>Phila.</orig><reg>Philadelphia</reg></choice>?</p>

Put this against the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">outlay</unclear>.
