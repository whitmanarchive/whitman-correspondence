            <p>My birthday today. 38. A time rousing many memories, solemn thoughts, &#38; 
            forward reaching anticipations.</p>
            <p>Most of all, thoughts of my dear mother&#8212;"buried &#38; gone, yet buried 
            <hi rend="underline">not</hi>, gone <hi rend="underline">not</hi> from me."<ptr target="loc.04661_n2"/> 
            How strongly I have felt that today! I feel somehow that there is indeed obscure 
            &#38; deep communion between us, not to be put in words, yet vital &#38; real.</p>
            <p>"Of all earth, life, love
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02582_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to me the best"&#8212;I pledge her dear memory&#8212;sacred &#38; precious to me evermore&#8212;with 
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi>&#8212;the supreme lover, my dearest friend, exemplar, &#38; 
                benefactor&#8212;as with one who
                also loves his mother's memory above all else.</p> 
            <p>May God in due time reunite us <hi rend="underline">there</hi>, in love deeper &#38; more 
                stainless than of old.</p>
            <p>How life deepens with advancing years! Miraculous &#38; wonderful beyond all speech, pierced through &#38; through with 
                shafts of light as from heaven itself&#8212;a deep &#38; mystic love revealing &#38; unfolding itself more &#38; more.</p>

            <p>"Praise the Lord for his goodness!"<ptr target="loc.04661_n3"/>&#8212;That old time ejaculation of psalmist David is 
                true in every generation&#8212;&#38; may be ours today in even greater measure.</p>
            <p>Deep gratitude from my heart to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>&#8212;dearest of all friends&#8212;for all the light &#38; joy 
                &#38;  blessing you have bestowed on me during the last twelve months. You little know all you have done for me! But you have 
                my dearest love evermore.</p>
            <p>Not only directly, but perhaps even more <hi rend="underline">in</hi>directly, you have deepened the channels of my life, &#38; 
                filled it with courage 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02584_large.jpg" type="verso"/>    
                &#38; joy. Old friendships you have deepened, &#38; new &#38; blessed ones have come to me 
               through <hi rend="underline">you</hi>.</p>
            <p>I have had touching proofs of this today. From a full heart I pray God to bless my friends, &#38; <hi rend="underline">you</hi> 
                their chief.</p>
            <p>This morning I received a letter&#8212;short, sweet, &#38; delicate, from our dear friend Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> enclosing 
                a bank note for <hi rend="underline">&#163;20</hi> sent to me by "the College"<ptr target="loc.04708_n4"/>&#8212;to start me to 
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. (I cannot come yet, but they mean that I <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> come when I can.)</p>
            <p>Along with it a letter from Johnston in his own behalf
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02585_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                warm &#38; friendly, &#38; an illustrated copy of his "<hi rend="underline">Notes</hi>"<ptr target="loc.04661_n4"/>&#8212;similar 
                to the one he sent to you.</p>
            <p>Letters, too, from other friends&#8212;swelling my heart with emotions almost painful&#8212;my dear old friend 
             Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> for 
                instance&#8212; &#38; Wentworth Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> &#38; others. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> sent me a 
                book, too, with a note in which he says&#8212;"I am indebted 
                to you for more than I can say. You have&#8212;unconsiously to yourself&#8212;answered questions of eternal importance to me."</p>
            <p>Letters, too, from children&#8212;two very sweet &#38; loving from Dixon's little girls.<ptr target="loc.04661_n5"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02586_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>"I'm a proud man the day"&#8212;and I tell <hi rend="underline">you</hi> about it, dear friend &#38; master, because 
                I owe so much of it to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. God bless you &#38; reward you.</p>
            <p>Some of the friends should have come to Anderton to tea with me&#8212;but business &#38; other engagements intervened. Johnston 
                however came, and as he had to return soon to his surgery, I came to Bolton again with him, &#38; and write this while he is
                professionally engaged. Very soon I shall have to start off for the last train home.</p>
            <p>We were very sorry to see in tonight's paper that
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.02587_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                you have had a spell of terrible heat in the States&#8212;96&#176; at Philadelphia. We are very much concerned on 
                <hi rend="underline">your</hi> account. We shall await reports anxiously.</p>
            <p>My life becomes more &#38; more intertwined with yours. God grant that in the future it may grow worthier, &#38; that I may be 
                enabled to devote such energies &#38; powers as are left me more &#38; more to your cause.</p>
            <p>I cannot write any more now.&#8212;But today&#8212;
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.02588_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                even more than usual&#8212;my heart goes out to you with love,&#38; blessing &#38; deepest gratitude &#38; honour.</p>
