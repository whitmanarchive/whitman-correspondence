                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>My birthday today. 38. A time rousing many memories, solemn thoughts, &amp; 
            forward reaching anticipations.</p>
            <p>Most of all, thoughts of my dear mother—"buried &amp; gone, yet buried 
            <hi rend="underline">not</hi>, gone <hi rend="underline">not</hi> from me."<ptr target="loc.04661_n2"/> 
            How strongly I have felt that today! I feel somehow that there is indeed obscure 
            &amp; deep communion between us, not to be put in words, yet vital &amp; real.</p>
            <p>"Of all earth, life, love
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02582_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to me the best"—I pledge her dear memory—sacred &amp; precious to me evermore—with 
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi>—the supreme lover, my dearest friend, exemplar, &amp; 
                benefactor—as with one who
                also loves his mother's memory above all else.</p> 
            <p>May God in due time reunite us <hi rend="underline">there</hi>, in love deeper &amp; more 
                stainless than of old.</p>
            <p>How life deepens with advancing years! Miraculous &amp; wonderful beyond all speech, pierced through &amp; through with 
                shafts of light as from heaven itself—a deep &amp; mystic love revealing &amp; unfolding itself more &amp; more.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02583_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>"Praise the Lord for his goodness!"<ptr target="loc.04661_n3"/>—That old time ejaculation of psalmist David is 
                true in every generation—&amp; may be ours today in even greater measure.</p>
            <p>Deep gratitude from my heart to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>—dearest of all friends—for all the light &amp; joy 
                &amp;  blessing you have bestowed on me during the last twelve months. You little know all you have done for me! But you have 
                my dearest love evermore.</p>
            <p>Not only directly, but perhaps even more <hi rend="underline">in</hi>directly, you have deepened the channels of my life, &amp; 
                filled it with courage 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02584_large.jpg" type="verso"/>    
                &amp; joy. Old friendships you have deepened, &amp; new &amp; blessed ones have come to me 
               through <hi rend="underline">you</hi>.</p>
            <p>I have had touching proofs of this today. From a full heart I pray God to bless my friends, &amp; <hi rend="underline">you</hi> 
                their chief.</p>
            <p>This morning I received a letter—short, sweet, &amp; delicate, from our dear friend Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> enclosing 
                a bank note for <hi rend="underline">£20</hi> sent to me by "the College"<ptr target="loc.04708_n4"/>—to start me to 
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. (I cannot come yet, but they mean that I <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> come when I can.)</p>
            <p>Along with it a letter from Johnston in his own behalf
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02585_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                warm &amp; friendly, &amp; an illustrated copy of his "<hi rend="underline">Notes</hi>"<ptr target="loc.04661_n4"/>—similar 
                to the one he sent to you.</p>
            <p>Letters, too, from other friends—swelling my heart with emotions almost painful—my dear old friend 
             Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> for 
                instance— &amp; Wentworth Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> &amp; others. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> sent me a 
                book, too, with a note in which he says—"I am indebted 
                to you for more than I can say. You have—unconsiously to yourself—answered questions of eternal importance to me."</p>
            <p>Letters, too, from children—two very sweet &amp; loving from Dixon's little girls.<ptr target="loc.04661_n5"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02586_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>"I'm a proud man the day"—and I tell <hi rend="underline">you</hi> about it, dear friend &amp; master, because 
                I owe so much of it to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. God bless you &amp; reward you.</p>
            <p>Some of the friends should have come to Anderton to tea with me—but business &amp; other engagements intervened. Johnston 
                however came, and as he had to return soon to his surgery, I came to Bolton again with him, &amp; and write this while he is
                professionally engaged. Very soon I shall have to start off for the last train home.</p>
            <p>We were very sorry to see in tonight's paper that
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.02587_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                you have had a spell of terrible heat in the States—96° at Philadelphia. We are very much concerned on 
                <hi rend="underline">your</hi> account. We shall await reports anxiously.</p>
            <p>My life becomes more &amp; more intertwined with yours. God grant that in the future it may grow worthier, &amp; that I may be 
                enabled to devote such energies &amp; powers as are left me more &amp; more to your cause.</p>
            <p>I cannot write any more now.—But today—
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.02588_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                even more than usual—my heart goes out to you with love,&amp; blessing &amp; deepest gratitude &amp; honour.</p>
