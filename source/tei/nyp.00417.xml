            <p>I go around here the same as ever&#8212;jaunt in the woods &#38; loafe about a good deal, (but always sure to be back at meal time)&#8212;heavy storms this week two nights, but the days bright &#38; clear every time&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#38; you, dear son, how do you make out down there? We think &#38; speak about you often&#8212;as I write, the wind is blowing a south west gale around here&#8212;I suppose it is pretty cold at Atlantic<ptr target="nyp.00417_n5"/>&#8212;It is now &#188; after 1&#8212;the school children are playing &#38; making a great racket, &#38; I see Hiniekin just come down from his dinner&#8212;the shoemaker has been over for his pitcher of cider&#8212;and there I hear Ruth calling me to come to my dinner&#8212;so I must bid good bye to you for the present, &#38; God bless you, my darling son&#8212;</p>
