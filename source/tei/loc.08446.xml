            <p> Another dear, good letter from you was received yesterday<ptr target="loc.08446_n2"/> for which I send you my
                heartiest thanks. How good it is of you to write to me so often! And you suffering
                from so many physical disabilities too!</p>
            <p> I can do naught but reverently accept these continued tokens of your great love
                &amp; with grateful heart say—"I thank you."</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_tb.00004.jpg" type="verso"/> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_tb.00005.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p> The best &amp; most welcome news in your letter was contained in the
                words—"nothing worse with me" which was indeed glad tidings to us all here I
                do hope &amp; trust that this comparatively good report will be confirmed by the
                next news about you.</p>
            <p> I thank you, too, for sending me Dr Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> letter to you from
                Montreal &amp; I shall look forward to seeing a copy of his address,<ptr target="loc.08440_n5"/> as I feel sure
                it will prove well worthy of the man whom I am proud to call friend.</p>
            <p> I am very sorry to hear that good M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/>
                has
                had a ten days illness, but am glad to know that she was getting better when you
                wrote. Will you please give her my kindest regards &amp; my sincere sympathy in her
                trouble which I trust may be nothing serious? She must take care of herself for her
                own &amp; for all our sakes.</p>
            <p> I received the book you kindly sent for George Humphreys<ptr target="loc.02495_n2"/>

                intelligent working-man, mainly self taught, &amp; has a sincere love for you &amp;
                appreciation of your message.</p>
