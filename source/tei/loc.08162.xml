                <p>I am really at a loss how to begin this letter or how to write it. My reception here<ptr target="loc.08161_n2"/> has been 
                such that I am absolutely dumbfounded. I got here about noon yesterday (I ought to say that I had a telegram at Queen's town
                from Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> to say that Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> &#38; he would meet me at <hi rend="underline">L. pool</hi> if I w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> let
                them know the time of my arrival, but I did not<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_zs.00528.jpg" type="verso"/> think it well 
                to give them that trouble &#38; came through alone)&#8212;Johnston &#38; Wallace met me at the Station.
                It was a fine day and I went around the town with D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. while he made his daily visits.
                Sat in the carriage while he went in the houses.  We went to a hotel to dinner&#8212;then 8 of us went for 
                a 20 mile drive through as picturesque a country as I have seen any where&#8212;had tea 8 miles from here with
                another Whitman friend (Rev. Thompson<ptr target="loc.04723_n4"/>) then he came to Bolton with us. By this time it was after 8 o'clock
                and on reaching Johnston's house we found half a room full of men waiting for us&#8212;from then to midnight
                was constant talk, songs, recitation, supper, and good fellowship generally. You are right to say that the Bolton
                friends are true and tender&#8212;they are that and if there are any stronger words you may use them!
                Most of the evening I laughed<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_zs.00529.jpg" type="recto"/> and the rest of it I could have cried their warmhearted
                friendship for you and for me was so manifest and so touching. I enclose<ptr target="loc.08162_n2"/> a song which they had composed &#38;
                set to music and which the whole room sang together in the middle of the evening&#8212;of course I made a speech
                of thanks and two other quite long speeches in the course of the evening&#8212;and I really spoke quite decently!
                a wonderful thing for me. You will of course, dear Walt, show this letter to Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> as there<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_zs.00530.jpg" type="verso"/>
                is no use my writing it over again to him.</p>
            <p>I trust you are no worse than usual&#8212;and that I shall find you to the fore when I return in September.</p>
                <p>Nothing to tell about the meter yet.</p>
            <p>Wallace slept here last night, he and Johnston desired me to say that they might not have time to write you today
                and wished me to give you their love and assure you of their<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_zs.00531.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                devotion to you and <hi rend="underline">the cause</hi>&#8212;and indeed, Walt, it looks as if the thing had come here
                <hi rend="underline">to stay</hi>&#8212;I was to say, too, to you &#38; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> that the canary<ptr target="loc.08056_n2"/> had come safe&#8212;not even
                the glass cracked! And that it was warmly appreciated. And I want you to tell Mrs Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> that they all know her here
                and feel very friendly towards her.</p>
            <p>I think I have said all I can say at the present moment&#8212;will soon write again</p>
