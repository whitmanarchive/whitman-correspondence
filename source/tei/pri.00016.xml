                <salute>W. M. Rossetti&#8212;Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yours of the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <choice><abbr>Feb.</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice><ptr target="pri.00016_n1"/> <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice>, &amp; indeed welcomed &amp; appreciated. I am jogging along still about the same in physical condition&#8212;still certainly no worse, &amp; I sometimes lately suspect rather better, or at any rate more adjusted to the situation&#8212;Even begin to think of making some move, some change of base, &amp;c. (the doctors have been advising it for over two years, 
                but I <choice><orig>hav'n't</orig><reg>haven't</reg></choice> felt to do it, yet.) My paralysis does not lift&#8212;I cannot walk any distance&#8212;I still have this baffling, 
                obstinate, apparently chronic affection of the stomachic apparatus &amp; liver&#8212;Yet, (as told in former letters) I get out doors 
                a little every day&#8212;write &amp; read, in moderation&#8212;appetite sufficiently good, (eat only very plain food, 
                but always did that)&#8212;digestion tolerable&#8212;&amp; spirits unflagging. (As said above, I have told you most of this before, 
                but suppose you might like to know it all again, up to date.) Of course, &amp; pretty darkly coloring the whole, 
                are bad spells, prostrations, <hi rend="underline">some pretty grave</hi> ones, intervals&#8212;&amp; I have resigned myself to the certainty 
                of permanent incapacitation from solid work&#8212;but things may continue at least in this half-and-half way, 
                for months&#8212;even years.
            </p>
            
            <p>My books are out, the new edition, a set of which, immediately on 'receiving your letter' of 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, I have 
                sent you (by mail March 15)<ptr target="pri.00016_n2"/> &amp; I suppose you have before this <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> them.
            </p>
            
            <p>My dear friend, your offers of help, &amp; those of my other British friends, I think I fully appreciate, 
                in the right spirit, welcome &amp; acceptive&#8212;leaving the matter altogether in your &amp; their hands&#8212;&amp; to your &amp; their 
                convenience, discretion, leisure &amp; nicety&#8212;Though poor now even to penury <hi rend="underline">I have not so far been deprived 
                of any physical thing I need or wish whatever&#8212;&amp; I feel confident I shall not, in the future</hi>. During my 
                employment of seven years or more in Washington after the war (1865&#8211;'72) I regularly saved a great part of my
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="pri.00016.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>wages&#8212;&amp; though the sum has now become about exhausted, by my expenses of the last three years&#8212;there are already 
                beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales of my new edition which I just job &amp; sell, 
                myself, (as the book agents here for 3 years in New York have successively, deliberately, badly cheated me)<ptr target="pri.00016_n3"/> &amp; shall continue to dispose of the books myself. And <hi rend="underline">that</hi> is the way I should prefer to glean my support&#8212;In that way I cheerfully accept all the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer (Prof. Dowden has sent me 
                the money for seven sets&#8212;which I have forwarded to him at Dublin.<ptr target="pri.00016_n4"/> I wish you to loan this letter to him to read.) I wish you to notify me&#8212;by postal card will do&#8212;soon as you receive your books sent on the 15th&#8212;I wish you also to loan this letter 
                to Mrs. Gilchrist, first of all. I shall write to her to-day or to-morrow&#8212;but briefly.
            </p>
            
            <p>To repeat a little, &amp; without undertaking details, understand, dear friend, for yourself &amp; all, that I heartily 
                &amp; most affectionately thank my British friends, &amp; that I accept their sympathetic generosity in the same spirit 
                in which I believe (nay, <hi rend="underline">know</hi>) it is offered&#8212;that 
                though poor <hi rend="underline">I am not in want</hi>&#8212;that I maintain good heart 
                &amp; cheer&#8212;&amp; that by far the most satisfaction to me (&amp; I think it can be done, &amp; believe it will be,) will be 
                to live, as long as possible, on <hi rend="underline">the sales</hi>, <hi rend="underline">by myself</hi>, <hi rend="underline">of my own works</hi>&#8212;&amp; perhaps, if practicable, 
                by further writings for the press.
