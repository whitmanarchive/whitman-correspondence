                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I received with thanks, &#38; read with much interest, the article by Mr. Hinton<ptr target="n0305"/>
                <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> you sent me. Besides Mr. Hinton's own share in the article, I was
                particularly glad to see in full Emerson's<ptr target="n0218"/> letter written on
                the first appearance of Leaves of Grass.<ptr target="loc.01879_n1"/> Of this I had
                hitherto only seen an expression or two extracted.</p>
            <p>Will you allow me to respond by sending two English notices of the selection. The one
                in the Academia I find is written by a Mr. Robertson<ptr target="n5001"/> whom I
                have met occasionally&#8212;a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies. The
                alterations noted in ink in his article are reproduced by me from the copy <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> he
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_tb.00614.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_tb.00615.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                himself sent me: I infer that they are in conformity with the original 
                   M.S., but cut out by a less ardent Editor. The Sunday Times is edited by a Mr. Knight<ptr target="loc.01879_n3"/>
                of whom also I have some slight personal knowledge. I think the review<ptr
                    target="loc.01879_n2"/> in that paper
                is very likely done by Mr. Knight himself. The Academia is a recently-started paper,
                chiefly scholastic, and I suppose of restricted circulation. The Sunday Times has no
                doubt a very large circulation, &#38; a good standing among weekly
                newspapers&#8212;not being however a specially <hi rend="underline">literary</hi>
                organ.</p>
            <p>You will, I think, have seen through Mr. Conway<ptr target="n0170"/> the notice, also
                eulogistic, in the London Review<ptr target="loc.01879_n4"/> I am told of a hostile one in
                the Express (evening edition of the Daily News) but have not seen it: the Morning
                    Star<ptr target="n0421b"/> (the paper most closely connected with John Bright) had a very handsome notice about a week ago&#8212;but, like
                all literary reviews in that paper, a brief one. These are all the notices I know of
                at present. Perhaps I ought to apologize for saying so much to you about a matter <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> I know plays but the smallest part in your thoughts &#38; interests as a
                poet.</p>
            <p>As to the sale of the book I really know nothing as yet&#8212;not having once seen
                the publisher since the volume was issued.</p>
            <p>A glance at the Sunday Times notice recalls to my attention a sentence therein <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> I <choice>
                    <abbr>sh.d</abbr>
                    <expan>should</expan>
                </choice> perhaps refer to&#8212;about your having given express sanction &amp;c.
                Where the writer gets this from I know not&#8212;certainly not from me: indeed the
                P.J. to the selection asserts the exact contrary, and I have not so much as seen Mr.
                Knight for (I dare say) a couple of years.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>With warmest regard and friendship,</salute>
                <salute>Yours</salute>
