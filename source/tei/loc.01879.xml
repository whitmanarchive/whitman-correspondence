                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received with thanks, &amp; read with much interest, the article by Mr. Hinton<ptr target="n0305"/>
                <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> you sent me. Besides Mr. Hinton's own share in the article, I was
                particularly glad to see in full Emerson's<ptr target="n0218"/> letter written on
                the first appearance of Leaves of Grass<!--add link to Emerson's letter-->. Of this
                I had hitherto only seen an expression or two extracted.</p>
            <p>Will you allow me to respond by sending two English notices of the selection. The one
                in the Academia I find is written by a Mr. Robertson<ptr target="n0513"/> whom I
                have met occasionally—a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies. The
                alterations noted in ink in his article are reproduced by me from the copy <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> he<!--<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01879.002.jpg" type="verso"/>-->
                himself sent me: I infer that they are in conformity with the original <choice>
                    <abbr>Ms.</abbr>
                    <expan>manuscript</expan>
                </choice>, but cut out by a less ardent editor. The Sunday
                Times<!--Is this the review?:http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00191.html-->
                is edited by a Mr. Knight<ptr target="n0336"/>, of whom also I have some slight
                personal knowledge. I think the review in that paper is very likely done by Mr.
                Knight himself. The Academia is a recently started paper, chiefly scholastic, and I
                suppose of a restricted circulation. The Sunday Times has no doubt a very large
                circulation, and a good standing among weekly newspapers—not being however a
                specially <hi rend="italic">literary</hi> organ.</p>
            <p>You will, I think, have seen through Mr. Conway<ptr target="n0170"/> the notice, also
                eulogistic, in the London Review<ptr target="n0360"/><!--Is this the review?:http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1867/anc.00192.html-->.
                I am told of a hostile one in the Express (evening edition of the Daily News) but
                have now <!-- "not"? -al --> seen it: the Morning Star<ptr target="n0421"/> (the
                paper most closely connected with John Bright<ptr target="n0104"/>) had a very
                handsome notice about a week ago—but, like all literary reviews in that paper,
                a brief one. These are all the notices I know of at present. Perhaps I ought to
                apologize for saying so much to you about a matter which I know plays but the
                smallest part in your thought and interest as a poet.</p>
            <p>As to the sale of the book I really know nothing as yet—not having once seen
                the publisher since the volume was issued.</p>
            <p>A glance at the Sunday Times notice recalls to my attention a sentence therein which
                I should perhaps refer to—about your having given express sanction &amp;c.
                Where the writer gets this from I know not—certainly not from me: indeed the
                P.S. to the selection asserts the exact contrary, and I have not so much as seen Mr.
                Knight for (I dare say) a couple of years.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>With warmest regard and friendship,</salute>
                <salute>yours</salute>

            <postscript>
                <p>"That was twenty years ago," said W., "and Rossetti is still serving under the
                    flag—a pirate flag, somebody said: but it is hardly that: it is more like
                    the red flag—the flag of revolution. The best of Rossetti is in the
                    natural way he takes this whole Leaves of Grass business, without apologizing
                    for, without glorifying, me."</p>
