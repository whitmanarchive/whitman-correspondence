            </opener>  
            <p>I saw lately that you were not so well—but hope it is a newspaper report merely
                and that you are continuing to gain. I saw Mrs. Dr. 
                Spaulding<ptr target="loc.02136_n2"/> recently she is doing all she can for the acceptance of
                L. of G. By the way I found a lover where I least expected it, in Mr. Hezekiah
                    Butterworth<ptr target="loc.02136_n3"/> of the "Youths Companion." Who said when
                I invited him to hear my lecture upon your work—"I shall come by all means. I
                think Whitman one of the greatest if not the greatest of our American poets."</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02136.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>He is not afraid of your work but wishes some of it were left out of it, for a
                popular volume. He would think it all right in itself I presume. Mrs
                    Moulton<ptr target="nyp.00729_n2"/> has gone south for a month. Returns
                in—May I hope she may be able to see you before she sails for England in
                June.— Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/> I never see now. Dont know what he is
                doing. I should like to see him very much. I am digging away in a fair way to earn a
                living.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02136.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I gave two evenings to your work before my class at New England Conservatory. My
                class is composed of about fifty bright young girls studying music. You see I am not
                afraid to carry your word to anyone. To me there is not a line that has a downward
                tendency. Still I recognzie the fact that to many people "A woman waits for me" is
                wholly inadmissable, and I know that the rest of the book is a sealed book to
                    them<ptr target="loc.02136_n4"/>—perhaps it would be anyway—there's
                consolation there. I shall have "Specimen Days"<ptr target="n4121"/> in my class
                during Spring term.</p>
