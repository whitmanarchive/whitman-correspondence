            <p>I hope a few words from a young but none the less hearty admirer of your wonderful
                poetry will not annoy you.</p>
            <p>It was six years ago, in a school in a quiet New England town, that I first heard
                your vivid measure. Our Teacher, a lady of unusually broad education, and also an
                enthusiastic lover of your writings, read aloud to us the touching
                lines&#8212;"Come up from the Fields, Father." We, boys &#38; girls were young, and
                merry, but we all felt the fresh country air, and later the deep pathos, and our
                teacher's voice thrilled with
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00833_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> it. It was as if a fresh, piney breeze had wafted in at the windows of that warm, busy
                room. I do not think any of us moved for a moment after the poem was ended; and then
                such a spontaneous, unpremeditated burst of applause, rose from girlish &#38; boyish
                hearts, and surprised our teacher. It was the outburst of admiration from honest
                hearts, for something that we all felt very keenly. It was not for our teacher, nor
                for Walt Whitman, but for the thrilling verses we had heard.</p>
            <p>I think never since that hour can I read my well-worn "Leaves of Grass," without that
                vague imagined scent of a piney breeze. And among all the daily increasing homage
                    
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00832_large.jpg" type="recto"/> which follows
                you, there is none, I am sure more sincere than mine.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine you responding to so commonplace a request as that for an autograph;
                but if there is one thing I would prize, it is your name, in your (by me) well-known
                hand. I intend getting a copy of the original photograph from which the Scribner
                portrait was taken, if I find it possible. And if in all your daily making you can
                find time to notice this humble request, I shall have the name of the man whose
                writings I most admire, in his own hand, and it will be my greatest treasure.</p>
