                not the genius of acting&#8212;I never witnessed Forrest acting but the houses were
                jammed, my experience of witnessing Booth was not so fortunate as yours&#8212;I seldom
                saw him to big houses the last time I saw him was at the Chatham Square theater&#8212;a
