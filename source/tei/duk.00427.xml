                up himself and his having
                drank some he was very angry
                and he went away without

                to him that i would not give
                him the 10 dollars i promised
                him as i knew he had money
                then) i thought probably they
                would have a spree but
                he went as far as suffron
                station about 30 miles and
                came back and went again
                on <choice><orig>thursday</orig> <reg>Thursday</reg></choice> nancy came here
                the night after he first went
                with very great complaints
