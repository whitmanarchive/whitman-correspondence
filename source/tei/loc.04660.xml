                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yesterday morning I received a long &#38; most kind &#38; affectionate letter from our dear friend 
                Horace Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/> When I got to Bolton I took an opportunity of calling in at 
                Johnston's,<ptr target="n4102"/> &#38; asked if the American mail had brought anything. Johnston 
                hadn't returned (came back today) but his "locum tenens"<ptr target="loc.04660_n5"/> <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> 
                me your postal of July 28<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr target="loc.04660_n2"/> &#38; the parcel of
                photos<ptr target="loc.04660_n3"/> &#38;c (which I 
                opened) &#38; a
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02572_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                short good letter from Traubel.</p>
            <p>I at once appropriated the tomb<ptr target="loc.07329_n5"/> photo. for myself &#38; have it here.</p>
            <p>I like the tomb itself very much&#8212;Its massive simplicity &#38; woodland surroundings are 
                perfectly fit &#38; appropriate.</p>
            <p>But I cannot write the thoughts it arouses.&#8212;Too much love goes out to you,&#8212;you fill too 
                precious &#38; dear &#38; warm a place in my heart for me to think of it with equanimity.</p>
            <p>Of course I know; &#38; rejoice in the knowledge that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will not enter it, 
                but that 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02573_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                for you is only joyful "transfer &#38; promotion."<ptr target="loc.04660_n6"/> But alas! for <hi rend="underline">us</hi> whom 
                you will leave.</p>
            <p>You said in a letter to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> which he gave us, that 
                the response from Bolton "cheered &#38; nourished your very heart."<ptr target="loc.04660_n4"/> It was an inexpressibly deep &#38; 
                sacred joy to me to know that. But it is impossible for you to know how the converse holds true, how 
                life giving &#38; sacredly dear &#38; sweet your more than paternal loving, kindness &#38; 
                benefactions have been, &#38; <hi rend="underline">are</hi>, to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. 
                They are my chiefest treasure, the supreme joy &#38; blessing of my life.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02574_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>May God bless you for all you have done for <hi rend="underline">me</hi>, &#38; for my friends. And how 
                many myriads more will have cause to love &#38; bless your name!</p>
            <p>I hope that our little band of friends in Bolton,<ptr target="loc.07991_n2c"/> may indeed prove a "church"&#8212;united in brotherly 
                love, &#38; consecrated to the highest ends. May God help me, &#38; help us all to realize that ideal 
                more &#38; more! And so may our love to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, our exemplar &#38; dearest 
                friend, increase &#38; deepen as time goes on.</p>
            <p>For a long time back now I have not been able to continue my old work in &#38; for "the College." 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02575_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                But I hope to resume my old place, &#38; to do all I can to cement it more firmly together, &#38; to 
                advance your cause, &#38; continue (within our little sphere) your work.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I haven't seen Johnston yet, but I partly expect him here tomorrow. I know he will be proud &#38; 
                pleased to receive the portraits &#38;c that you sent him.&#8212;And thanks to you, from our hearts, 
                from us all.</p>
            <p>You have added a new &#38; deeper value to our friendships. You have given us new friends (Traubel, 
                Dr Bucke Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38;c)
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02576_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                who amaze us by the cordiality &#38; affectionate warmth of their friendship &#38; kindness, you have 
                given to us new &#38; brighter hopes for the future&#8212;(friends increasing &#38; love deepening) 
                &#38; in your own love you have given us the supreme gift &#38; blessing.</p>
            <p>I feel very full tonight as I think of it all. For my lot is not without troubles just now, &#38; it 
                stirs me with deep thankfulness to think how divinely &#38; wonderfully they are off set &#38; 
                recompensed. And thanks to <hi rend="underline">you</hi> for it all, &#38; to God through you.</p>            
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.02577_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I cannot write any more tonight. I think of you sitting in your room, perhaps alone, unwell, with 
                sacred &#38; solemn thoughts about the future &#38; memories of the past, &#38; with love in your 
                heart, deep &#38; tender as a mother's, towards all your friends. &#38; I could 
                <hi rend="underline">kiss</hi> you if I were there, &#38; had only courage to do it!</p>            
            <p>My best love to you anyway, &#38; best wishes &#38; prayers.</p>

                <p>A "Rose Festival" procession just passed here. Got up by the children of the village (assisted by 
                    older people), &#38; composed almost completely of children. All kinds of disguises,&#8212;the 
                    most amusing, merry, &#38; pretty thing of the kind I have ever seen.&#8212;Very cleverly done, too.</p>
