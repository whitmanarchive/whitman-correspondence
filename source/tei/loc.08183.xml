            <p> Thanks for your kind remembrance of me in your note &#38; enclosure.<ptr
                    target="n5002d"/> I am a very dilatory correspondent and save in necessary
                business I hardly write a letter, "The Spirit does not move me" so, even to my near
                relatives &#38; best friends. I am glad that Logan<ptr target="n6122"/> does better
                than his father&#8212;He is an improved edition in every way, dear fellow, I know
                not what will come out of him but he is cramming much into his head by hard,
                unremitting study&#8212;and in the Ancients whom you so detest or despise.</p>
            <p> We are in the pivotal city of the world, within personal knowledge or touch of those
                who are guiding political, scientific, moral, philanthropic &#38; religious <unclear

                highly interesting for one who feels in conscience released responsibility for
                further work&#8212;to sit by a looker on in Venice<ptr target="loc.08183_n2"/>&#8212;and see the struggling
                tides flow past. I have my youth renewed to me in the extreme delight I take in our
                country home. We are now in our London house, but I spend two or three days a week
                in the country. I am building about 20 feet up a big oak tree a "House in the
                Garden" such as the East Indian sages retire to at leaving their property &#38;
                cares to their families to find Nirvana and prepare for the great change. I have
                caught some of the pantheistic feeling of oneness <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_jm.00441.jpg" type="recto"/> in my spirit with nature &#38; I have not
                been so restfully happy since I was a boy. Is it second childhood?</p>
            <p> I am glad to hear so cheerful an account of you and that your true friends continue
                to gather around you. You have many, many friends not known to you in the flesh in
                England. Your place &#38; fame are assured in the centers of anglo Saxon literature.
                I wish that you had a more attractive home than Mickle St Camden, which is a place
                as free from sentiment for a poets residence as could be found. But it is your
                choice &#38; you are happy there <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jm.00442.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> as one of the uncounted millions whom you represent.</p>
            <p> Thank you for remembering me from time to time with papers. I am anchored here, but
                it is at best a foreign port&#8212;Pennsylvania has been the home of my family for
                over 200 years and it is the place of my affections.</p>
            <p> Logan is out here to join me in the message of love from Mary,<ptr
