            </opener>

            <p>Both your letters came this week—also one from my friend Eldridge, he too
                speaks of meeting &amp; talking with you.—It is real winter here, the ground all
                covered with snow, as I look out—not the least thaw to-day, as it is
                cloudy—I rise pretty late mornings—had my breakfast a little
                while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread &amp; sweet butter, very
                nice—eat with very fair appetite—I enjoy my breakfast better than any
                other meal—(eat a light dinner pretty late, &amp; no supper)—Feel
                generally about the same as before described—no worse, no better, (nothing to
                brag of anyhow)</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01639.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry—from our house, the cars run by
                the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry—the
                Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide—it is a noble river, not
                so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, &amp;
                with more style, &amp; with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken
                ice, many little &amp; some great big cakes—the boats are very fine &amp;
                strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot
                thick &amp; more—I enjoy crossing these days—it does me good—the
                ferrymen are all very kind &amp; respectful—</p>

            <p>—I have been reading a book "<hi rend="underline">Merrie England in the Olden
                    Time</hi>,"<ptr target="loc.01639_n1"/> a London book, with pictures, full of fun &amp; humor—I have enjoyed
                it much—There is an awful amount of want &amp; suffering, from no work,
                hereabout—a young man was here yesterday—had seen me in
                <choice><abbr>Wash</abbr><expan>Washington</expan></choice>—wanted help—I gave him a little—I see the cars &amp;
                locomotive skurrying by as I close. </p>
