            </opener>

            <p>Both your letters came this week&#8212;also one from my friend Eldridge, he too
                speaks of meeting &amp; talking with you.&#8212;It is real winter here, the ground all
                covered with snow, as I look out&#8212;not the least thaw to-day, as it is
                cloudy&#8212;I rise pretty late mornings&#8212;had my breakfast a little
                while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread &amp; sweet butter, very
                nice&#8212;eat with very fair appetite&#8212;I enjoy my breakfast better than any
                other meal&#8212;(eat a light dinner pretty late, &amp; no supper)&#8212;Feel
                generally about the same as before described&#8212;no worse, no better, (nothing to
                brag of anyhow)</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01639.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry&#8212;from our house, the cars run by
                the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry&#8212;the
                Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide&#8212;it is a noble river, not
                so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, &amp;
                with more style, &amp; with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken
                ice, many little &amp; some great big cakes&#8212;the boats are very fine &amp;
                strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot
                thick &amp; more&#8212;I enjoy crossing these days&#8212;it does me good&#8212;the
                ferrymen are all very kind &amp; respectful&#8212;</p>

            <p>&#8212;I have been reading a book "<hi rend="underline">Merrie England in the Olden
                    Time</hi>,"<ptr target="loc.01639_n1"/> a London book, with pictures, full of fun &amp; humor&#8212;I have enjoyed
                it much&#8212;There is an awful amount of want &amp; suffering, from no work,
                hereabout&#8212;a young man was here yesterday&#8212;had seen me in
                <choice><abbr>Wash</abbr><expan>Washington</expan></choice>&#8212;wanted help&#8212;I gave him a little&#8212;I see the cars &amp;
                locomotive skurrying by as I close. </p>
