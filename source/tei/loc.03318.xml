                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>

            <p>I have this morning received your card of the 11th rec'd. <hi rend="underline"><choice>

                        <expan>Specimen</expan>
                    </choice> Days in America</hi> makes its appearance in the London book-shops
                to-morrow, &#38; before you get this I expect you will have a preliminary batch of
                six copies of the volume. I am writing to the publishers to-day to instruct them
                about sending the 50 more you want. The publishers seem to have made some mistake
                about the <hi rend="underline">Preface</hi> &#38; <hi rend="underline">Addl
                    note</hi> printed slips. I gave them distinct instructions about sending them,
                &#38; I must just make them pay for their mistake by sending you further copies of
                the book to supply the omission. I enclose two cut-out leaves which they sent to me
                last week, with some vague idea of atonement, I suppose.</p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon J. Addington Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> called here
                unexpectedly when I had a pile of the <choice>

                </choice> on the table, &#38; he was delighted with the appearance, &#38;c. of the
                book. I took him a copy on going to dine with him &#38; Roden Noel<ptr
                    target="n3109"/> in Eaton Square last night. I sent copies off to many other
                folk yesterday,&#8212;Mrs. Costelloe<ptr target="n6109"/> among the rest. She wrote
                me a nice little note about it, which arrived this morning. Gabriel Sarrazin, the
                young French critic, who is writing a study of L. of G., which he is tremendously
                taken with, shall have one to-day or to-morrow.<ptr target="n3115"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03318.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I feel quite
                proud at being the agent &#38; deputy of the book in this way. It gives me quite a
                new conception of my own importance in the world. I do hope you will like the
                general get-up of the book, &#38; so on. If we have made any slips in this respect
                in the book, we can profit by them in the <hi rend="underline">Democratic

                </choice> papers for which I look forward to receiving.</p>
            <p>I was glad to hear &#38; read in the papers you sent of the brilliant success of the
                Lincoln Lecture.<ptr target="loc.03318_n1"/> How I wish you could come over here
                &#38; deliver it too; but I suppose that may not be. The gathering of the <choice>

                    <reg>literati</reg>
                </choice> in the audience was very significant. It shows a new departure, I think,
                on the scholastic literary side.</p>
            <p>By this time I expect Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is with you &#38; has
                given you a general account of things over here. (Give him my hearty greetings!) By
                him I sent a batch of birthday wishes for the 31st, which I follow now with all
                imaginable devout orisons. In your coming year I earnestly <add type="unmarked"
                    place="left">hope you will have the great gratification of seeing a deeper &#38;
                    wider application of Leaves of Grass, pointing to a nearer consummation of their
                    great idea than we have hitherto deemed possible! And, so, with deep love, I
