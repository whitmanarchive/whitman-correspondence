            </opener>

            <p>Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> has told you of our difficulties in getting comfortable quarters here—and also that we seem now to have succeeded—not indeed in the way I most wished &amp; hoped we had—in 19th St., taking rooms &amp; boarding ourselves—so that we could have a friend with us when &amp; as we pleased. It seems as if that were not practicable unless we were to furnish for ourselves. Certainly our experiences there of using another's kitchen were discouraging—it was so dirty and uncomfortable that we were glad to take refuge in a regular boarding house again before one week was out. It seems to me more difficult to get anything of a medium kind in New York than elsewhere I have been—if it isn't the best, it is very uninviting indeed. Herby is enjoying his work and companionship at the League very much. We stand the cold well—how does it suit you? Is your arm free from rheumatic pains? When you come to Mr. J. H. Johnstons,<ptr target="n0336"/> which will be very soon I hope, we shall be quite handy, and have a pretty, sunny room—a sitting room by day!—with a handsome piece of furniture which is metamorphosed into a bed at night—and a large dressing closet with hot &amp; cold water adjoining—all very comfortable. O how wistfully do I think of one evening in Philadelphia, last winter. I shan't begin really to like New York till you come and we have had some chats together. I have news from England which makes me rather anxious. The Blaenavon Co., to which Per.<ptr target="n2000"/> is chemist, has gone into liquidation—&amp; I don't know whether it will continue to exist—or how soon in these dull times he may find a good opening elsewhere. Should things go badly for him, either Giddy<ptr target="n0890"/> and I will return to England to share [our] home with him there, or else I want him to take into serious consideration coming out here, instead of our going back. Of course it would be a risky thing for him to do with wife<ptr target="n3006"/> &amp; child, in these times, unless some definite opening presented itself, but I cannot help thinking that, being an expert in his profession, with first rate training &amp; experience, and iron work &amp; metallurgy promising here to have such enormous developments, he would be sure to do well in the end; and meanwhile we could rub on together somehow. However, we shall see. I have laid the matter before him, he &amp; his dear little wife wrote me a very brave, cheery letter when they told me the bad news—&amp; I shall have an answer to mine, I suppose, by the end of the month. Kate Hillard<ptr target="n0302"/> read an amusing paper on Swinburne<ptr target="n0610"/> at a meeting of the Woman's Club in Brooklyn—&amp; we had some fine music too. For the rest, I have not yet presented any introductions here.</p>
            
            <p>Have had some beautiful glimpses of the North &amp; East River effects of the shipping at sunset, &amp;c.—Have subscribed to the Mercantile library,—&amp; are beginning to feel at home. Herby &amp; Giddy had been to hear Mr. Frothingham<ptr target="n1504"/> this morning, &amp; were much interested. Bee<ptr target="n0260"/> missed us sorely at first—but writes—when she does write, which is but seldom—pretty cheerily. Friendly remembrance to your brother &amp; sister. I wonder where Hattie<ptr target="n0911"/> &amp; Jessie<ptr target="duk.00343_n2"/> are spending their holidays. Love from us all. Good-bye, dear friend.</p>

                        <p>Had a letter from Mr. Marvin<ptr target="n0830"/>—all well—he is doing the Washington letter of a N. Eng. paper. Hopes &amp; trusts you are really going to Washington.</p>
