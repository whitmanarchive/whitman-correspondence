            </opener>
            
            <p>i have got in
            the habit of writing to you
            every <choice><orig>sunday</orig> <reg>Sunday</reg></choice> so i thought
            i <choice><orig>wouldent</orig> <reg>wouldn't</reg></choice> break through
            to day) i received your letter
            yesterday<ptr target="duk.00465_n1"/> after looking all day
            for one i was glad to have
            the letter and glad to have the
            2 dollars at noon i <choice><orig>hadent</orig> <reg>hadn't</reg></choice> one
                cent and i asked georgee<ptr target="duk.00425_n2"/> to
            give me 50 cents and after looking
            for a considerable time he laid
            me down 50 cents
            well Walt i felt
            so bad and child like i cried because
            he <choice><orig>dident</orig> <reg>didn't</reg></choice> give me more if i had
            got the 2 dollars a little sooner i
            should not have asked
            </p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="duk.00465.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>i have got along very well
            up to about 2 weeks ago and since that
            time <choice><orig>goerge</orig> <reg>George</reg></choice> has been moody and would hardly speak only when i
                spoke to him well of course you will say mother put the worst constructions on it
                well Walt i did not the first few days i thought perhaps something had gone wrong in
                his business affairs but up to to day he has been so different from what he was ever
                since i have been home<ptr target="duk.00465_n13"/> but to day he is more like
                himself Well Walt i thought of every thing sometimes i would think
                        <choice><orig>maybee</orig> <reg>maybe</reg></choice> he is tired of having
                me and Edd<ptr target="duk.00425_n13"/> and then i would
            think george is too noble a fellow
            for that to be the cause and i knew
            that i had not or he had not
            been to more <choice><orig>expence</orig> <reg>expense</reg></choice> than if
                he paid his board Jeffy<ptr target="duk.00422_n2"/> told me
            to have a talk with george and
            ask him what made him so
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="duk.00465.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
            but i <choice><orig>dident</orig> <reg>didn't</reg></choice> like to i would ask
            him if he <choice><orig>wasent</orig> <reg>wasn't</reg></choice> well and so on
            but i <choice><orig>doo</orig> <reg>do</reg></choice> hope it will go over
            i acted just the same as if i did
            not notice any change but i felt
            awful bad and what has
            made him act so god only knows
            but i believe it runs in the
            Whitman family to have such
            spells any how i hope they
            <choice><orig>wont</orig> <reg>won't</reg></choice> come often) Jeff is quite
            sick to day he was sick nearly
            all night vomiting and purging
            he has eaten very heartily
            lately he eat chicken and stuffing
            for his supper and cranberry
            pie before he went to bed and
            i think that is one great cause
            of his sickness he looks bad
            but probably it will <choice><orig>doo</orig> <reg>do</reg></choice> him
            good to have a good clearing 
            out the rest is all well mat<ptr target="duk.00465_n9"/>
