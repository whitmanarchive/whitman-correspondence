            <salute>Dear brother Walt</salute>
            <p>I append slip from the Evening paper of last Thursday that frightened us all so.
                I telegraphed Thursday evening and again Friday&#8212;and was on my way to the
                telegraph office yesterday afternoon when I was handed your dispatch. We were all glad
                to know that the statement was wrong although as the time passed and I had an
                opportunity to reason it over I felt pretty well assured that there was a mistake in
                the statement&#8212;The morning papers of Friday, however, all repeated the
                statement and gave as authority the press reports</p>
            <p>I hope you are all o.k. again and able to get around as usual. If you are tied down
                to the house I imagine you feel pretty sick. In my own case when sick I find that
                the fact that I cannot get out makes me feel as badly as anything else</p>
            <p>We are all well and getting on quite

                nicely. The girls have been busy "putting up"
                large quantities of all sorts of stuff in the pickle &#38;c line&#8212;as much to
                practice I presume as with any idea that it would be needed</p>
            <p>I have had considerable to do this summer&#8212;have only been away once (to St
                Joseph) since I was East&#8212;I expect to go to St Jo
                the last of this week&#8212;and toward the middle or last of Nov hope to come
                East&#8212;at least as far as Camden&#8212;so <choice>
                    <orig>dont</orig>
                    <reg>don't</reg>
                </choice> be surprised to see me pop in at any time</p>
            <p>All send love to George and Lou and to yourself&#8212;by-the-way I must be
                considerable behind in regard to Ed's board&#8212;when George or Lou write ask them
                to please state how far and I will square up&#8212;</p>
            <p>We are having splendid fall weather&#8212;never so delightful&#8212;I have just
                finished a seven days out door survey&#8212;putting up at the nearest place where
                night found us&#8212;the country was new to me and very beautiful&#8212;the weather
                perfect&#8212;it was like going back 25 years. Let me
                hear from you soon&#8212;again love to all</p>
