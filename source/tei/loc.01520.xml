                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I thought I would write you a letter to-day, as you would be anxious to hear. I rec'd
                your letter of Aug. 24, &amp; it was a great comfort to me. I have read it several
                times since—Dear Pete, I hope every thing is going on favorably with you. I
                think about you every day &amp; every night. I do hope you are in good spirits &amp;
                health. I want to hear about the face.<ptr target="loc.01520_n1"/> I
                suppose you are working on the road.</p>

            <p>There is nothing new or special in my affairs or doings. The weather is pleasant
                here—it is pretty cool &amp; dry. My folks all continue well—mother
                first rate, &amp; brothers ditto. I do not have such good luck. I have felt unwell
                most every day—some days not so bad. Besides I have those spells again, worse,
                last longer, sick enough, come sudden, dizzy, &amp; sudden sweat—It is hard to
                tell exactly what is the matter, or what to do. The doctor says it is all from that
                hospital malaria, hospital poison absorbed in the system years ago—he thinks
                it better for me in Washington than here. </p>

            <p>About one third of the time I feel pretty well. I have taken three or four of my
                favorite rides on Broadway. I believe I described them to you in my letters a year
                ago. I find many of my old friends, &amp; new ones too, &amp; am received with the
                same warm friendship &amp; love as ever. Broadway is more crowded &amp; gay than
                ever, &amp; the women look finer, &amp; the shops richer—then there are many
                new &amp; splendid buildings, of marble or iron—they seem to almost reach the
                clouds, they are so tall—some of them cost millions of dollars. </p>

            <p>Staging in N. Y. has been very poor this summer—9 or $10, even on the big
                Broadway lines—Railroading has also been slim. New York is all cut up with
                railroads—Brooklyn also—I have seen Jimmy Foy<ptr target="loc.01520_n2"/>—he was over to Brooklyn, looking for work on a road. He was well &amp;
                hearty, &amp; wished to be remembered to you. They pay $2½ on many of the
                roads here, &amp; 2¼ on the rest. The work is pretty hard, but the hours not so
                long as in Washington.</p>

            <p>There is all kinds of fun &amp; sport here, by day &amp; night—&amp; lots of
                theatres &amp; amusements in full blast. I have not been to any of them—have
                not been to see any of my particular women friends—though sent for, (the
                papers here have noticed my arrival)—have not been down to the sea-shore as I
                intended—In fact my jaunt this time has been a failure—Better luck next
                time—</p>

            <p>Now Pete, dear, loving boy, I don't want you to worry about me—I shall come
                along all right. As it is, I have a good square appetite most of the time yet, good
                nights' sleep—&amp; look about the same as usual, (which is, of course,
                lovely &amp; fascinating beyond description.) Tell Johnny Lee<ptr target="loc.01520_n3"/> I send him my love,
                &amp; hope he is well &amp; hearty. I think of him daily. I sent him a letter some
                time ago, which I suppose he rec'd about Aug. 26, &amp; showed you<ptr target="loc.01520_n5"/>—but I
                have not had a word from him. Lend him this letter to read, as he will wish to hear
                about me. </p>

            <p>God bless you, dear Pete, dear loving comrade, &amp; Farewell till next time, my
                darling boy. </p>
