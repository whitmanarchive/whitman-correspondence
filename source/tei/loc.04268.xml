                <salute>My dear Mr Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p> I send you Alys'<ptr target="loc.04268_n3"/> circular letter and will you please
                mail it to Miss Nicholson after you have read it. Alys must be having a delightful
                time, besides going through a most interesting experience. I am spending my summer
                among the Blue Ridge mountains in a place that belongs jointly to my mother and my
                aunt Mrs Pearsall Smith.<ptr target="loc.04268_n2"/> The country is beautiful, and it is always quite cool. </p>
            <p>I don't know whether you remember a young man whom you met at my Uncles several
                times Tom Worthington by name. <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00426_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> Alys he and I came over to see you once last winter. Both he and
                I want you to know that we are engaged to be married.<ptr target="loc.04268_n4"
                /> I still intend to continue my course at Bryn Mawr College which will be three
                years longer and then I shall most likely be married. My brother Bond, who is engaged
                to Miss Edith Carpenter<ptr target="loc.04268_n5"/> one of Mariechen's<ptr target="loc.04268_n7"/>
                Smith College friends expects to be married on the 13th of October, and he and Edith
                intend to live in Millville New Jersey. </p> 
            <p>I hope, Mr. Whitman that you have not been sick this summer, but I have been afraid
                that these last few hot days have been hard for you; if you ever have time I wish
                you would let me know how you are, but this I shan't expect <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.00427_large.jpg" type="recto"/> you to do, because I know how over
                run you are with letters, so I shall have to wait till I come to Philadelphia next
                October and find out for my self. Tom Worthington is spending the summer with us and
                he wishes to be remembered to you, he is just at this moment writing a letter to the
                Nation on the labor question which has been on his mind for some time. </p>
            <p>Hoping again that you are better </p>
