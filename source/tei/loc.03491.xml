                <salute>Mr Walter Whitman,</salute>
                <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yesterday's "Sun" of this city contained a notice of the celebration of your seventy-second
                birth day;<ptr target="loc.04326_n3"/> and called to my mind events which took place at "Armory Square Hospital"<ptr target="n0043"/> at the close
                of the War of the Rebellion.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I had two wounded brothers there, one Colonel C. K. Prentiss<ptr target="loc.03491_n3"/> of the 6<hi rend="underline">th</hi> Maryland volunteers; in the 
                officers ward, and the other, Willie S. Prentiss,<ptr target="loc.03491_n4"/> private from a Maryland
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03491.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Reg<hi rend="underline">t</hi> in the Southern Army.</p>
            <p>They had both been wounded in the same battle before Petersburgh on the 2<hi rend="underline">nd</hi> of April, the 
                two Reg<hi rend="underline">ts</hi> having met face to face.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I mention these facts in the hope that they might bring the case to your memory.&#8212;</p>
            <p>They were both desparately wounded, and lay in Wards separated from one another,
                and I was in attendance upon them both, passing from one to the other as their needs 
                required, and dreadfully anxious for them.</p>
            <p>Going into Willie's Ward one day, I found a stranger
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03491.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                seated by his side, in kindly converse with him.(&#8212;He had had a leg amputated&#8212;)</p>
            <p>This gentleman proved to be none other than your self, and I have never ceased to feel deeply 
                grateful to you for your kindness to my dear brother; for your visits to him were repeated again 
                and again, until his death, and <hi rend="underline">I know gave him great pleasure</hi>.&#8212;</p>
            <p>My one object in now writing is to thank you for your Friendship to him with the hope that the
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03491.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                case may not have wholly passed from your memory, and to tell you that the lapse of quarter of a 
                Century has not lessened my appreciation of the attention shown my brother.&#8212;</p>
            <p>May Gods best belongings rest upon you.</p>
