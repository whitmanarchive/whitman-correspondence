            <p>The hospitals during the War, were in my mind and heart so much I could but feel the
                distress of the homesickness of the poor fellows&#8212;when the news came
                to me, that my Boy was wounded, I said "Oh tell me that he is dead. I can stand <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="man_ej.00202_large.jpg" type="verso"/>that&#8212;for it would be my own
                suffering, but I cant endure to think of Percy as
                    wounded in the Hospital and homesick&#8212;it was at night the news came to us
                that he was wounded, perhaps fatally and all the night I lay in such
                distress&#8212;but the next morning&#8212;when I was hurrying them off to Pontiac
                my son in law came to me (I saw that no horse was <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">hot</unclear> out of the Stable)&#8212;and
                he laid his head on my shoulder and said, "Mother you said you could bear to hear
                that Percy was dead&#8212;but not that he was wounded and living"&#8212;"Yes" I
                said, "I could"&#8212;then he said, "he is dead" <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="man_ej.00201_large.jpg" type="recto"/>and I felt a sort of
