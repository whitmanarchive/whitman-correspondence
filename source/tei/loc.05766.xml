                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I promised you I would send you fifty dollars four times over for your portrait by
                    Hine,<ptr target="loc.05766_n1"/> but the thought has occurred to me that your
                moving may make it desirable to have some extra cash just now, and so I send you my
                check for one hundred dollars and will send the balance before you need it, I trust;
                if not a gentle reminder from you will fetch it. </p>
            <p> As I looked at your things packed up for moving, I wondered if you had in any way by
                will or otherwise secured their safe care when you have passed away. Some one who
                loves you should have them to give to the world in proper shape. I do not consider
                myself the proper one, although I hope some day to tell the world "what I know about
                Walt Whitman," but the safe care of your literary remains I feel anxious to have in
                right hands. </p>
            <p> Mr. Montgomery<ptr target="loc.05766_n2"/> was wonderfully delighted with meeting you, and talked of nothing
                else all day and evening. He is a man of very marked ability, who will be heard of
                before long in politics and literature. I think he has a wonderfully well-balanced
                mind. Alma<ptr target="n3029"/> was sorely disappointed at my not bringing you home
                with us Sunday and hope you will very soon visit us. </p>
            <p> I want you to write me the full history of the painting by Hine&#8212;when, where,
                how, &amp;c &amp;c. </p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
