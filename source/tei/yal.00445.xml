            <p>
                I send you a cheering review of Hosnett's book from the <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi>. So far I have not been able
                to find the book here, but will continue the search. It appears to give you great rank, and prefigures big future verdicts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got your letter of last May, but have not been well able to write with my half-paralyzed hands and moribund head. My little book overwhelmed 
                me with letters, and <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal_af.00022_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I have felt stung not to be able to answer many of them, but so it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope the liquorice powder helped you. If not satisfactory, please let me know sometime when you are writing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a letter from Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> recently, which I will try to answer soon. I was glad he had such a good time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Donnelly<ptr target="n4108"/> promised to have his book out this June, but I guess the decipheration process was more laborious 
                than he had reckoned. My faith is not shaken.
            </p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="yal_af.00023_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
         
            <p>
                Life seems to have almost stopped still with me. I earnestly wish I could get well, or else
                peg out suddenly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you have stood the summer fairly well. It has been, lasting three or four days, pretty comfortable, and
                the worst is now, which is pretty dog dayish.
            </p>

                <salute>Au revoir.</salute>

                   up to Canada this summer? Charley Eldridge<ptr target="n0210"/> intends leaving here for the North on a trip Saturday, and wanted to stop to see you at Camden, but
                   doubts whether he should find you there.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    &#8212;I had a note from Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> the other day, asking leave to print some letters of mine to Rossetti about his mother. He is writing 
                a memoir of her, which is nearly completed.
