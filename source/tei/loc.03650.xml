                    you it is indescribably lovely here now&#8212;no doubt Kirkwood is the same&#8212;the light so brilliant and yet soft&#8212;the rich autumn tints just beginning to appear&#8212;the temperature delicious&#8212;crisp &amp; bracing, yet genial&#8212;</p>
            <p>The throng of people is gone&#8212;but a few of the pleasantest of the old set remain&#8212;&amp; a few interesting new ones have come&#8212;among them Mrs. Dexter from Boston, who was a Miss Ticknor, daughter of the author of the book on Spanish literature&#8212;she and her husband full of interesting talk&#8212;Also Mr Martin <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#al">Busines</unclear> and his

            <p>I went over the Lunatic Asylum here the other day &amp; saw some strange sad sights&#8212;some figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection I shall never forget them&#8212;some very bright &amp; talkative.

                splendid capacity for the post&#8212;a noble looking old man (uncle of those Miss Chases you met at our house)&#8212;</p>
                
                <p>I can't settle to anything or think of any thing since I 
                received Per's letter but the baby &amp; Norah&#8212;</p>
