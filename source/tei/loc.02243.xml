                proposed to accompany me and make its necessary illustrations.</p>
            <p>I understood, but not with sufficient certainty, that Mr. Stoddart,<ptr
                    target="loc.04674_n1"/> had reason to suppose that you would see us,&#8212;that
                he had seen you to that end, in fact. But I feared that some mistake might have
                occurred an<supplied reason="torn-away" resp="#smb" cert="high">d</supplied> that
                our purpose had not been made clear; in which case, had we called upon you, we might
                have been put into an embarrassing position. My former letter was, then, a formal
                request for permission to see you.</p>
            <p>While I am very anxious to effect this object, I am at the same time anxious to avoid
                crossing your wishes. Only it would be a kindness if you would intimate them. Will
                you, then, let me know whether it is convenient for you to, see us or not? Your
                permission would be a favor and, if it must be so, your denial would put an end to
                my suspense. In either case I should know what to do. I earnestly hope, however, you
                will understand our motives and our desire to give you as <unclear
