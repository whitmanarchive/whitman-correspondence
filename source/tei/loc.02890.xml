                <salute>My dearest Friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I must write again, out of a full heart. For the reading of this book "The Two
                Rivulets" has filled it very full&#8212;Ever the deep inward assent, rising up
                strong, exultant, my immortal self recognizing, responding to your immortal self.
                Ever the sense of dearness <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02888.002.jpg" type="verso"/> &#8212;the sweet subtle perfume, pervading every page, every line
                to my sense&#8212;O I cannot put into any words what I perceive nor what answering
                emotion pervades me, flows out towards you&#8212;sweetest deepest greatest
                experience of my life&#8212;what I was made for&#8212;surely I was made as the soil
                in which the precious seed of your thoughts &amp; emotions should be
                planted&#8212;try to fulfil themselves in me, that I might <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02890.003.jpg" type="recto"/> by &amp; bye blossom into beauty &amp;
                bring forth rich fruits&#8212;immortal fruits&#8212;So no doubt other women feel,
                and future women will.</p>

            <p>Do not dissuade me from coming this autumn my dearest Friend&#8212;I have waited
                patiently 7 years&#8212;patiently yet often, especially since your illness with such
                painful yearning your heart would yearn towards me if you realized it&#8212;I cannot
                wait any longer. Nor ought I to&#8212;that would indeed be sacrificing the prudence
                that concerns itself with immortal things to the prudence that concerns itself only
                with temporary <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02888.004.jpg" type="verso"/> ones.
                But, indeed, even so far as this latter is concerned, there is no sacrifice
                required<!-- Not in Harned? -JS --> for any. It is by far the best step, for
                instance, I could take on Beatrice's<!-- <ptr target="loc.02890_n1"/> -->
                account She is heartily in earnest in her medical studies&#8212;I am persuaded, too,
                it is a splendid training for her whether or no she ever makes a money earning
                profession of it. And in England women have at present, no means of obtaining a
                complete <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02890.005.jpg" type="recto"/> medical
                education. They cannot get admission to any Hospital for the clinical part of the
                course&#8212;So that she is exceedingly anxious to come where it is possible for her
                to follow out her aims effectually. Then, I am confident she will find America
                congenial to her&#8212;that she is in her essential nature democratic&#8212;&amp;
                that she has the intelligence, the sympathies earnestness affectionateness,
                unconventionality needed to pierce through appearances surface "crudeness" &amp; see
                &amp; love the great reality unfolding <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02888.006.jpg" type="verso"/> below. So I believe has Herby.<!-- <ptr target="loc.02890_n2"/> --> Then an artist is as free as an author to
                work where he pleases&#8212;reaps as much from fresh and widened experiences. He
                does not contemplate cutting himself off from England&#8212;will exhibit
                here&#8212;very likely take a studio in London for a season, a couple of years hence
                to work among old friends &amp; associations, &amp; so have double chance &amp;
                opportunities. Then above all, dearest <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02890.007.jpg" type="recto"/> friend they too see America in &amp;
                through you&#8212;they too would fain be near you. Have no anxiety or misgivings for
                us. Let us come &amp; be near you&#8212;&amp; see if we are made of the right sort
                of stuff for transplanting to American soil. Only advise us <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned">where.</supplied> If it be Philadelphia
                (which as far as offering facilities for Beatrice would, as far as I can learn, suit
                us very well <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02888.008.jpg" type="verso"/> We must
                not come I think till the end of October because of its being so full&#8212;Perhaps
                indeed dearest Friend (but I dare not build on it) we shall talk this over in
                England&#8212;If you are able to take the journey, it might, and would be sure to do
                you good as well as to rejoice the hearts of English friends. But if not, if we are
                not able to talk over our coming, do not feel the least anxious about us. We shall
                light on our feet &amp; do very well; Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02890_n3"/> -->
                seems getting on fairly well considering what a bad time it is in his <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02890.009.jpg" type="recto"/> line of business. I
                think he will be able to marry this autumn or following winter&#8212;I shall go and
                spend a month with him in July. Perhaps indeed if as many are prophecying the iron
                trade does not recover its old pre-eminence here&#8212;he may be glad by &amp; bye
                that I have gone over to America &amp; opened a way for him. But if he does not
                follow me then, if I live, I hope to spend a few months with him every three or four
                    <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02888.010.jpg" type="verso"/> years, instead of
                as now a few weeks once a year. Anyhow we have to live widely apart.&#8212;Thanks
                for the papers just received. Specially welcome the account of some stranger's
                interview with you&#8212; for me too before very long now the joy of hearing the
                "strong musical voice," read the "Wound Dresser" or speak. </p>

            <p>I have happy thoughts for my companions all day long, helping me over every
                difficulty&#8212;strengthening me. </p>
