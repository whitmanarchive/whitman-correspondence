            </opener>

            <p>I must write again, out of a full heart. For the reading of this book "The Two Rivulets"<ptr target="loc.02250_n7"/> has filled it very 
                full—Ever the deep inward assent, rising up strong, exultant, my immortal self recognizing, responding 
                to your immortal self. Ever the sense of dearness 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02890.002_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                —the sweet subtle perfume, pervading every page, every line to my sense—O I cannot put into any 
                words what I perceive nor what answering emotion pervades me, flows out towards you—sweetest deepest 
                greatest experience of my life—what I was made for—surely I was made as the soil in which the 
                precious seed of your thoughts &amp; emotions should be planted—try to fulfil themselves in me, that 
                I might 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02890.003_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                by &amp; bye blossom into beauty &amp; bring forth rich fruits—immortal fruits—So no doubt other 
                women feel, and future women will.</p>
            <p>Do not dissuade me from coming this autumn my dearest Friend<ptr target="med.00665_n1"/>—I have waited patiently 7 years—patiently 
                yet often, especially since your illness with such painful yearning your heart would yearn towards me if you 
                realized it—I cannot wait any longer. Nor ought I to—that would indeed be sacrificing the prudence 
                that concerns itself with immortal things to the prudence that concerns itself only with temporary 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02890.004_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                ones. But, indeed, even so far as this latter is concerned, there is no sacrifice required for any. It is 
                by far the best step, for instance, I could take on Beatrice's<ptr target="loc.02890_n1"/> account She is 
                heartily in earnest in her medical studies—I am persuaded, too, it is a splendid training for her 
                whether or no she ever makes a money earning profession of it. And in England women have at present, no 
                means of obtaining a complete 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02890.005_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                medical education. They cannot get admission to any Hospital for the clinical part of the course—So that 
                she is exceedingly anxious to come where it is possible for her to follow out her aims effectually. Then, I am 
                confident she will find America congenial to her—that she is in her essential nature democratic—&amp; 
                that she has the intelligence, the sympathies earnestness affectionateness, unconventionality needed to pierce 
                through appearances surface "crudeness" &amp; see &amp; love the great reality unfolding 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02890.006_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                below. So I believe has Herby.<ptr target="n0262"/> Then an artist is as free as an author to work where 
                he pleases—reaps as much from fresh and widened experiences. He does not contemplate cutting himself off 
                from England—will exhibit here—very likely take a studio in London for a season, a couple of years 
                hence to work among old friends &amp; associations, &amp; so have double chance &amp; opportunities. Then above 
                all, dearest 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02890.007_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                friend they too see America in &amp; through you—they too would fain be near you. Have no anxiety or 
                misgivings for us. Let us come &amp; be near you—&amp; see if we are made of the right sort of stuff 
                for transplanting to American soil. Only advise us where. If it be Philadelphia (which as far as offering 
                facilities for Beatrice would, as far as I can learn, suit us very well 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02890.008_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                We must not come I think till the end of October because of its being so full—Perhaps indeed dearest Friend 
                (but I dare not build on it) we shall talk this over in England—If you are able to take the journey, it might, 
                and would be sure to do you good as well as to rejoice the hearts of English friends. But if not, if we are not able 
                to talk over our coming, do not feel the least anxious about us. We shall light on our feet &amp; do very well;
                Percy<ptr target="loc.02890_n3"/> seems getting on fairly well considering what a bad time it is in his 
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02890.009_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                line of business. I think he will be able to marry this autumn or following winter—I shall go and spend 
                a month with him in July. Perhaps indeed if as many are prophecying the iron trade does not recover its old 
                pre-eminence here—he may be glad by &amp; bye that I have gone over to America &amp; opened a way 
                for him. But if he does not follow me then, if I live, I hope to spend a few months with him every three or four

                years, instead of as now a few weeks once a year. Anyhow we have to live widely apart.—Thanks for the papers 
                just received. Specially welcome the account of some stranger's interview with you—for me too before very 
                long now the joy of hearing the "strong musical voice," read the "Wound Dresser" or speak.</p>
            <p>I have happy thoughts for my companions all day long, helping me over every difficulty—strengthening me.</p>
