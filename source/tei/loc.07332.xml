            <p>Yours of 7<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.07332_n2"/> to hand last evening. It was (as always)
                heartily welcome. Yes, you <hi rend="underline">are living on your ancestry</hi> at

                been under the sod fifteen months ago&#8212;at least. I was real glad to get Miss
                Alys'<ptr target="uva.00553_n3"/> letter to you, re Mrs Costelloe<ptr
                target="loc.02189_n1"/>, and to see by it that Mrs C. was in better health. I
                was also glad to get the cutting re Browning<ptr target="n0116"/> who seems to have been a mighty fine
                fellow.<ptr target="loc.07332_n4"/> I sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> like to know whether he was really of
                Jewish stock (as they say) I think it more than likely I believe that is the
                greatest stock of all and am never surprised to find that it is an element in a
                great man. Well, we still have La Grippe here though things are mending a little
                with us. The doctors are all</p>

            <p>out of bed again but are a long way from up to par yet. There are still many members
                of the staff (attendants &#38;c) who are sick or half sick. I hope hope however we
                are over the worst of it. Willy Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> is mending, is able to sit
                up now. The children are mostly better but some of them ailing yet. I have opened an
                infirmary for 40 patients&#8212;20 men and 20 women&#8212;within the last few
                days&#8212;this has been making a little extra work lately so that La Grippe struck
                us in a bad time&#8212;but we will worry along and after a little we shall get into
                daylight again.</p>
