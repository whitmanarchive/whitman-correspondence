      <p>Well, mother dear, here I sit again in the rocking chair by the stove&#8212;
        I have just eat some dinner, a little piece of fowl &amp; some toast &amp; tea&#8212;
        my appetite is good enough&#8212;&amp; I have plenty brought to me&#8212;I have been 
        sitting up all day&#8212;have some bad spells, but am decidedly gaining upon the whole&#8212;
        think I have fully recovered where I was a week ago, and even a little better&#8212;
        went down stairs yesterday and out for five minutes into the street&#8212;
        &amp; shall do so again this afternoon&#8212;as I think it did me good yesterday&#8212;
        though I was very tired, on returning&#8212;as I have to go down &amp; up 4 flights of stairs&#8212;
        The doctor comes every day&#8212;(I must tell you again I have a first-rate doctor&#8212;
        I think he understands my case exactly&#8212;I consider myself very lucky in having him)<ptr target="nyp.00310_n2"/>&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>Mother, yesterday was a very serious day with me here&#8212;I was not so very sick, 
        but I kept thinking all the time it was the day of Matty's funeral&#8212;
        Every few minutes all day it would come up in my mind&#8212;I suppose 
        it was the same with you&#8212;Mother, your letter came Friday afternoon&#8212;
        it was a very good letter, &amp; after reading it twice, I enclosed it 
        in one to Han&#8212;she must have got it Saturday night&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>There are great preparations here for 4th of March&#8212;inauguration&#8212;
        if you &amp; I had a house here,<ptr target="nyp.00310_n3"/> we would have George &amp; Lou come on &amp; see the show, 
        for I have no doubt it will be the finest ever seen here&#8212;(but I am 
        in hopes to be able to get away for all that)&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <p>½ past 4.
      </p>
      
      <p>Mother, I have just been down &amp; out doors&#8212;walked half a block&#8212;&amp; have come back&#8212;
        <hi rend="italic">went all alone</hi>&#8212;(got a little assistance at the steps)&#8212;this is the most 
        successful raid yet&#8212;&amp; I really begin to feel something like myself&#8212;
      </p>
      
      <closer>
        <salute>Hope this will find you all right, dearest Mother&#8212;</salute>
