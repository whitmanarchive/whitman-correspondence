                All goes well with us here, we are having at the present moment a splendid rain
                which will do a lot of good. The trees are coming into leaf rapidly and in a few
                more days at the present rate the country will be green. I have the Tribune you sent
                me con'g an acct. of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Walt, if I were in your fix I would
                think seriously of going there for the next six months or a year (or even longer, but
                that would depend) as a private patient. They might do you good (they will have the
                best skill going) and if they did not you would be more comfortable there than
                anywhere else perhaps in the world. If you would<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00578.jpg" type="verso"/> think well of this I would go to Baltimore&#8212;make all the arrangements and then
                take you from Camden to the Hospital. There is no palace in Europe so comfortable
                for a sick or half sick man as this hospital would be. Think this over seriously (it
                is worth it) Show this letter to Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> and talk it over with
                him (but H. does not half realize as I do the boon such a chance would be to you) </p>
