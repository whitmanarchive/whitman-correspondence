            <p>I send you a little remembrancer&#8212;enough to pay your expenses up here when you get ready to come, which I hope will be before long. I have <choice><abbr>rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> reminders from you from time to time in the shape of papers &amp;c, which I have been glad to get. I see about all that is in the <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> as I take the semi-weekly  The sketch of Carlyle in the

            London paper was the best I have seen, your own words upon his death were very noble &amp; touching. It was a proper thing for you to do &amp; it became you well The more one reads &amp; knows of Carlyle the more one loves &amp; reverences him. He was worth all other Britains put together to me. What have we to do with his opinions? He was a towering &amp; god like man &amp; that was enough. He is to be judged as a poet &amp; prophet, &amp; not as a molder of opinion. He was better &amp; greater than any opinion he could have. His style too

            I would not have different True it was not the "Mary-had-a-little-lamb" style of most of his critics, any more than your own prose style is, but grand &amp; manly &amp; full of thunder &amp; lightning.</p>

I am correcting the proof of <hi rend="underline">Pepacton</hi> &amp; writing an article for <hi rend="underline">Scrib</hi> on Thoreau. I first wrote them

            a notice of his Journal just published, which they were pleased to say was too good for a book notice &amp; that I must make a body article out of it &amp;c. <hi rend="underline">Scrib</hi>. has displayed some remarkable journalistic enterprise lately&#8212;they have got from <hi rend="underline">Emerson</hi> his article on Carlyle for their May no. This is <hi rend="underline">sub rosa</hi> &amp; is not for the public yet. I enclose you a slip of the article or lecture which you may have seen. I do not think his trip hammer with the Aeolian attachment figure conceived in the highest spirit. It is so preposterous &amp; impossible that it spoils it for me, but it raps
            soundly upon the attention for a moment, &amp; I suppose that is enough for his purpose.</p>
