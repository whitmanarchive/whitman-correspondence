                <salute>Dear Friend</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>The newspapers have both come to hand &amp; been gladly welcomed. I shall realize you
                on the 26th sending living impulses into those young
                men, with results not to cease&#8212;their kindled hearts sending back response
                through glowing eyes that will be warmer to you than the June sunshine. Perhaps,
                too, you will have pleasant talks with the eminent astronomers there. Prof.
                    Young,<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n1"/> --> who is so skilful <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02862.002.jpg" type="verso"/> a worker with that most subtle fetcher
                of tidings from the Stars, the Spectroscope&#8212;always, it seems hitherto bringing
                word of the "vast similitude that interlocks all " nay of the absolute identity of
                the stuff they are made of with the stuff we are made of."&#8212;The news from
                Dartmouth, that too, is a great pleasure. </p>

            <p>I have been what seems to me a very long while since last writing, because it has
                been a troubled time within &amp; what I wrote I tore up again, believing it was
                best wisest so&#8212;You said in <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02862.003.jpg" type="recto"/> your first letter that if you had leisure you could write one
                that "would do me good &amp; you too"; write that letter dear Friend after you have
                been to Dartmouth<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n2"/> -->&#8212;for I
                sorely need it. Perhaps the letters that I have sent you since that first, have
                given you a feeling of constraint towards me because you cannot respond to them. I
                will not write any more such letters; or, if I write them because my heart is so
                full it cannot bear it, they shall not find their way to the Post. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02862.004.jpg" type="verso"/> But do not, because I
                give you more than friendship, think that it would not be a very dear &amp; happy
                thing to me to have friendship only from you&#8212;I do not want you to write what
                it is any effort to write&#8212;do not ask for deep thoughts, deep
                feelings&#8212;know well those must choose their own time &amp; mode&#8212;but for
                the simplest current details&#8212;for any thing that helps my eyes to pierce the
                distance &amp; see you as you live &amp; move to-day. I dearly like to hear about
                your Mother&#8212;want to know if all <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02862.005.jpg" type="recto"/> your sisters are married, &amp; if you have plenty of little
                nephews &amp; nieces&#8212;I like to hear anything about Mr. O'Connor<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n3"/> --> &amp; Mr.
                    Burroughs,<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n4"/> --> towards both of whom I feel as toward friends. (Has Mr. O'Connor succeeded
                in getting practically adopted his new method of making cast steel? Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n5"/> --> being a worker in the field of Metallurgy
                make me specially glad to hear about this.) Then, I need not tell you how deep an
                interest I feel in American politics &amp; want to know if you are satisfied with
                the result of the Cincinnati Convention &amp; what of Mr. Greely?<!-- <ptr target="loc.02862_n7"/> --> &amp; what you
                augur as to his success&#8212;I am sure dear friend if <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02862.006.jpg" type="verso"/> you realized the joy it is to me to
                receive a few words from you&#8212;about anything that is passing in your thoughts
                &amp; around&#8212;how beaming bright &amp; happy the day a letter comes &amp; many
                days after&#8212;how light hearted &amp; alert I set about my daily tasks, it would
                not seem irksome to you to write. And if you say, "Read my books, &amp; be
                content&#8212;you have me in them"&#8212;I say, it is because I read them so that I
                am not content. It is an effort to me to turn to any other reading; as to highest
                literature what I felt three years ago is more than <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02862.007.jpg" type="recto"/> ever true now, with all their precious
                augmentations&#8212;I want nothing else&#8212;am fully fed &amp; satisfied there. I
                sit alone many hours busy with my needle; this used to be tedious; but it is not so
                now&#8212;for always close at hand lie the books that are so dear so dear I brooding
                over the poems sunning myself in them, pondering the Vistas&#8212;all the experience
                of my past life &amp; all its aspirations corroborating them&#8212;all my future
                &amp; so far as in me lies the future of my children to be shaped modified vitalized
                by &amp; through these&#8212;outwardly &amp; inwardly. How can I be content to live
                wholly isolated from you? I <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02862.008.jpg" type="verso"/> am sure it is not possible for any one,&#8212;man or woman, it
                does not matter which, to receive these books, not merely with the intellect
                critically admiring their power &amp; beauty, but with an understanding responsive
                heart, without feeling it drawn out of their breasts so that they must leave all
                &amp; come to be with you sometimes&#8212;without a resistless yearning for personal
                intercourse that will take no denial. When we come to America, I shall not want you
                to talk to me; shall not be any way importunate. <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">To</supplied> settle down where there are some
                that love you &amp; understand your poems, somewhere <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02862.009.jpg" type="recto"/> that you would be sure to come pretty
                often&#8212;to have you sit with me while I worked, you silent, or reading to your
                self, I don't mind how: to let my children grow fond of you&#8212;to take food with
                us; if my music pleased you, to let me play &amp; sing to you of an evening; Do your
                needlework for <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">you&#8212;talk</supplied> freely of all that occupied my thoughts concerning
                the childrens welfare &amp;c&#8212;I could be very happy so. But silence with the
                living presence <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02862.010.jpg" type="verso"/>
                silence with all the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">Ocean</unclear> in between are two different things. Therefore, these years
                stretch out your hand cordially trustfully that I may feel its warm <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">grasp</unclear>. </p>
