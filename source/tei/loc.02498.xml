            <p>
                Again have I to thank you for your kindness in writing to me. Your p.c of June
                18<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02498_n1"/> reached me on the evening of June 29<hi rend="underline">th</hi>
                while J.W.W<ptr target="n6121"/>—who had dropped &amp; had tea with me—&amp; I
                were sitting here talking about you; thus realizing the old proverb—"Speak of the Angel
                &amp; you hear the flap of his wing!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Its arrival then was doubly welcome &amp; we thank you most cordially for it.
            </p>

                Wallace at once took a rough facsimile of it for himself.

                We are especially pleased with the brightness &amp; cheeriness wh: pervades it—W.
                called it "a reamer!"—&amp; for the good spirits in which you evidently were
                at the time of writing &amp; to which the presence of those "two dear little boys" &amp; "their
                delicious chatter" no doubt contributed.
            </p>
            <p>
                God bless them for cheering you with their childish prattle; &amp; may it be long before their young hearts
                lose their freshness and charming naiveté.
            </p>
            <p>
                And they are fortunate little boys too, though of course they cannot know that; but some day when they are
                grown up
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02498.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                they will perhaps think so &amp; be able to tell <hi rend="underline">their</hi> little boys that
                they were friends of Walt Whitman!
            </p>
            <p>
                We rejoice to hear that you were "emerging as before" from the prostration of those
                "fearful, unprecedented, three days' hot spell" which "pulled you down like a pack of hounds"
                &amp; we hope soon to hear of your getting out &amp; enjoying the fresh air with all its delights.

                Do you know that this is the anniversary (by the day of the week, tho' it is tomorrow by the calendar)
                of my sailing from England to America, last year?<ptr target="loc.02496_n3"/>

                Today I have been pondering over the events of that ever memorable month of July 1890; beginning with
                the long sea voyage, during which you were so often the topic of talk on board &amp; you were my chief
                object of desire for so many days; thinking of the time when I sat for countless hours <gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="chars"/> the
                ship's prow, facing America &amp; watching
                our steel Leviathan wedging her way thro' the green waters of the broad Atlantic, &amp; every moment
                bearing me nearer and nearer to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>; when, anchored in the Delaware I lay
                in my berth and
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02498.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                looked across the water at the gleaming lights of Camden where I knew <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                were; when, next morning I ferried the River, booked at the West Jersey Hotel &amp; with a palpitating
                heart made my way to 328, Mickle St. &amp; was at length shewn up stairs by Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/>
                heard your welcoming words:—"Come in, doctor! Come right in!"
                and was received by you with such open-hearted loving-kindness, not once but many times.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I think of
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02498.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                those two happy, happy days I spent with you &amp; all you have been to me since, my heart
                swells with reverential grateful love to you, my Benefactor, my dearest &amp; best friend.
            </p>
