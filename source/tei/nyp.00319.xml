        <salute>Dear Nelly:</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>About me, my ailments, no great difference. (A queer old doctor here&#8212;did I tell you?&#8212;sticks to it that, 
        although the trouble has taken the form of paralysis, &amp; instigated far back, the basic &amp; origin are of 
        <hi rend="italic">stomachic</hi> nature&#8212;at any rate the derangement &amp; suffering <hi rend="italic">now</hi> 
        are mostly gastric &amp; liver business&#8212;telling in distress of head)&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I went over to <choice><abbr>Phil</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice>Phil: yesterday, &amp; had a nice, good, I may almost say <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> afternoon, with dear Mrs. Lesley, 
        Kate Hillard, &amp; the two Miss Lesleys, daughters<ptr target="nyp.00319_n2"/>&#8212;us four, only, no men-critters but me&#8212;I was there some four hours, 
        filled with animated talk&#8212;we had dinner, very nice, a nice glass of wine&#8212;Mrs. L. a fine gentle, sweet-voiced, 
        handsome black-eyed New England woman, (of the Lyman family, daughter of Judge Lyman.)<ptr target="nyp.00319_n3"/> With Miss H[illard], though the first meeting, I got along capitally&#8212;found her a jolly, hearty girl&#8212;evidently seen life &amp; folks, &amp; read lots&#8212;she talked much about the London literati, 
        &amp; the (I suppose I may say) <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> friends of mine there, both men &amp; women, nearly all of whom she knew well, 
        giving me, among the rest, descriptions of <hi rend="italic">Personnel</hi> that were new &amp; very interesting to me. She goes to Wash[ington] 
        to-morrow, to stay there (1734 I <choice><abbr>st.</abbr><expan>Street</expan></choice>) a month&#8212;reads a series of twelve papers on English poets.
      </p>
      
      <p>I made a short call on Hector Tyndale, 1021 Clinton <choice><abbr>st</abbr><expan>Street</expan></choice>&#8212;he came down to see me, in the parlor&#8212;(I did not see Mrs. T.)&#8212;Hector did not seem much different, physically&#8212;had the tone, I thought, 
        of one who is <hi rend="italic">dreary</hi> of life, to whom it is all an <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, a settled morbidity&#8212;of course that was the worst. 
        I <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> a letter from Marvin to-day&#8212;from Peter Doyle yesterday&#8212;snowing here as I write&#8212;the baby fine, 
        fat, bright today, but raising his voice lustily just this moment&#8212;You got my letter three days since?<ptr target="nyp.00319_n4"/>
