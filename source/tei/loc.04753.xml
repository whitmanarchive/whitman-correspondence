            </opener>
            <p> It is less than a year ago that I made your acquaintance so to speak, quite by
                accident, searching among the shelves of a bookstore. </p>
            <p> I was attracted by the curious title "Leaves of Grass", opened the book at random,
                and my eyes met the lines of "Elemental Drifts" </p>
            <p> You then and there entered my soul, have not departed, and never will depart. </p>
            <p> Be assured that there is at least one (and I hope there are many others) who
                understands you as you wish to be understood; one, moreover, who has weighed you in
                the balance of his intuition and finds you the greatest of poets. </p>

                    <corr>subtle</corr>
                </choice> unison with Nature and Humanity as you have done, who can blend the soul
                harmoniously with materials, who sees good in all and o'erflows in sympathy toward all
                things, enfolding them with his spirit: to such a man I joyfully give the name of
                Poet:&#8212; the most precious of all names. </p>
            <p> At the time I first met your work, I was engaged upon the essay which I herewith
                send you. I had just finished "Decadence". In the "Spring Song" and the "Song of the
                Depths" my orbit responded to the new attracting sun.<ptr target="loc.04753_n3"/></p>
            <p> I send you this essay, because it is your opinion of it above all other opinions
                that I should most <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_gt.00234_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

                What you may say in praise and encouragement will please me, but sympathetic surgery
                will better please. </p>
            <p> I know that I am not presuming, for have you not said:&#8212; "I concentrate toward
                them that are nigh."&#8212;"will you speak before I am gone? will you prove
                already to late?" </p>
            <p> After all,&#8212;words fail me, in writing to you. Imagine that I have expressed to you my
                sincere conviction of what I owe. </p>
            <p> The essay is my "first effort," at the age of 30. I, too, "have sweated through fog
                with linguists and contenders" I, too, "have pried through the strata, analyzed to a
                hair", searching for the basis of a virile and indigenous <pb xml:id="leaf003v"

                in silence to this day, for fear of foolish utterances, I hope at least that my words
                may carry the weight of conviction. </p>
            <p> Trusting that it may not be in vain that I hope to hear from you, believe me, noble
                man, affectionately your distant friend, </p>
