            </opener>
            <p>I am afraid you will think my promise to write to you was not sincere but I have had
                very little time to myself for letter writing but now that I have set about to
                redeem my word I hope it will be welcome and receive a speedy reply from you. To
                begin at the beginning of my visit I spent nearly three weeks in New York with Mr.
                &amp; Mrs. Northen<ptr target="n5001"/> and of course<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="owu.00030.002.jpg" type="verso"/> had a splendid opportunity of going
                about and seeing all I wanted in New York. I was quite fortunate with regard to the
                weather as I believe we only had two real stormy days while I was there. One thing I
                enjoyed about as much as any was the exhibition of pictures out at the Museum in the
                Park. Miss Woolf's<ptr target="n5001"/> collection, the very rich lady who died a
                year or so ago, was there also a large number of others including the one given by
                Vanderbilt called "The Horse Fair."<ptr target="owu.00030_n2"/> I believe<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="owu.00030.003.jpg" type="recto"/> looking at beautiful pictures and
                hearing good music are my chief pleasures with of course reading added the last a
                thing one could hardly exist without.</p>
            <p>I went over to Brooklyn to call on Jo. Barkelor.<ptr target="n5001"/> You of course
                remember her, she was so fond Grandma<ptr target="n0705"/> and is one of your ardent
                admirers. I did enjoy seeing her so much as I was unfortunate to miss her when I
                called last July as she had sailed for Europe the day before.</p>
            <p>She is a very lovely and smart<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="owu.00030.004.jpg" type="verso"/> woman. Well to proceed with my trip I left New York on the
                twentieth of February for Hartford and have enjoyed my visit so far very much. These
                friends were new last fall but I almost feel as if I had known them always,
                particularly one from Ireland who is on a visit to America for
                the first time. Next Saturday I go to another friend's house
                for a couple of weeks which will about end my traveling about and turn my face once
                more towards Burlington. </p>
