                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yesterday on my way up to Olive to see my wife's father, who is near the end of his
                life's journey, I read in the <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> of the death of Wm
                O'Connor.<ptr target="n2002"/>

                was news I had been expecting for some time, yet it was a stunning blow
                for all that I know how keenly you must feel it, &#38; you have
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01167.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
            my deepest sympathy. No words come to my pen adequate to express the sense of the
                loss we have we suffered in the death of that chivalrous &#38; eloquent soul. How strange
                that his life has all passed, that I shall see or hear him no more.</p>
            <p>And it is sad to me to think that he has left behind him no work or book that at all
                expresses the measure of his great powers. What<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01167.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                a gift of speech that man had! If you can tell me anything about his last days I
                shall be very glad to hear it. Also where he is buried.</p>
            <p>I am pretty well, &#38; have been immersed in farm work for the past six weeks. We
                have rented our house to a New York man for 5 months. Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> &#38; I live in the old
                house with a man who works for me, &#38; Ursula<ptr target="n0892"/> boards in Po'Keepsie. I hope this

            <p>The wave of orchard bloom has just passed over us &#38; the world has been very
                lovely. Drop me a line my dear friend if you are able to do so.</p>
