            <p>I was really astonished to hear my quondam college mate&#8212;young Henry Norman<ptr
                    target="n3171"/>&#8212;was the one who engineered the <hi rend="underline">Pall
                    Mall Gazette</hi> subscription. I always knew Norman had a soft spot 'way down
                deep in him somewhere. There was a race-antipathy between us, however. I <hi
                    rend="underline">suspect</hi> I was the one who first introduced you to him. For
                when we were in college together in Cambridge Mass. I was in the first flush of my
                enthusiasm for you; had just read you for the first time, &#38; after a while I came
                out &#38; made a solemn confession of faith before the whole Divinity
                School&#8212;Professors &#38; all&#8212; &#38; told them what I had found in you.
                They were a band of earnest liberal fellows (Norman &#38; I the best read of 'em)
                &#38; I saw that they did not laugh, &#38; that my solemnity impressed them. I
                suspect, my <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal.00296.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> dear
                friend, that you&#8211;being of English &#38; Dutch stock&#8212;do not find in you the
                race-antipathy that I&#8212;a French-Scotch-Irish-Englishman find in me.</p>
