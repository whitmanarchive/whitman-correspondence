                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Since the receipt of your last letter to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston,<ptr
                    target="n4102"/> I cannot help thinking continually about you and
                the&#8212;complicated disorders your letter reported. And so,&#8212;though I have
                nothing else to write about,&#8212;I<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02200.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> want to send you a line or two again to express my loving
                sympathy with you and my best wishes. I hope that you are better than when you
                wrote, + I am anxious to hear a better report.</p>


            <p>After about a fortnight's post, we have had today a heavy fall of snow. The young
                moon shines brightly tonight, +<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02201.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> it is again freezing. It seems likely that we shall have an
                "old-fashioned" (frosty) Christmas.</p>




            <p>The weather is very different to that in which D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston
                visited you, and I try to imagine you&#8212;in these short, dark days&#8212;confined
                to the room which D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J's description + photographs<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02202.jpg" type="verso"/> have made so
                familiar&#8212;solitary and ill&#8212;It reminds me of my mother's condition in her
                last years&#8212;lame, suffering + much alone&#8212;and my heart goes out to you
                like a son's.</p>
            <p>But, as circumstances darkened, she herself only seemed to grow sweeter and more
                    loveable,&#8212;more<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02203.jpg" type="recto"/>
                loving, tender + self-forgetting and her faith deeper and <choice>

                    <corr>higher</corr>
                </choice>. And I, too, learned to love her more + more.</p>
            <p>Day by day your influence is spreading, and new friends are learning to appreciate
                and to love you, with grateful reverence, and a personal affection such as no one<pb
                    xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02204.jpg" type="verso"/> ever aroused
                before.&#8212;I am deeply grateful that I, for one, am&#8212;privileged to write to
                you, and to act as spokesman for an increasing multitude of others who are not so
                privileged, but who, like myself, will think of you at this season with loving
                good-will and tender sympathy. God bless you + all your household</p>
