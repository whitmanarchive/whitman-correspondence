               <salute>Dear Mother</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your letters were very acceptable&#8212;one came just as I was putting my last in the post office&#8212;I guess they all come right&#8212;I have written to Han &amp; George, &amp; sent George papers&#8212;Mother, have you heard any thing whether the 51st went on with Burnside, or did they remain as a reserve in Kentucky<ptr target="loc.00789_n2"/>&#8212;Burnside has managed splendidly so far, his taking Knoxville &amp; all together, it is a first class success&#8212;I have known Tennessee union men here in hospital, &amp; I understand it therefore&#8212;the region where Knoxville is, is mainly union but the southerners could not exist without it, as it is in their midst&#8212;so they determined to pound &amp; kill &amp; crush out the unionists&#8212;all the savage &amp; monstrous things printed in the papers about their treatment are true, at least that kind of thing is&#8212;as bad as the Irish in the mob treated the poor niggers in New York<ptr target="loc.00789_n3"/>&#8212;we north[erners] dont understand some things about southerners, it is very strange&#8212;the contrast&#8212;if I should pick out the most genuine union men &amp; real patriots I have ever met in all my experience, I should pick out two or three Tennesse &amp; Virginia unionists I have met in the hospitals, wounded or sick&#8212;one young man I guess I have mentioned to you in my letters, John Barker,<ptr target="loc.00789_n4"/> 2d Tennessee Vol. (union)&#8212;was a long while a prisoner in secesh prisons in Georgia, &amp; in Richmond&#8212;three times the devils hung him up by the heels to make him promise to give up his unionism, once he was cut down for dead&#8212;he is a young married man with one child&#8212;his little property destroyed, his wife &amp; child turned out&#8212;he hunted &amp; tormented, &amp; any moment he could have had any thing if he would join the confederacy&#8212;but he was firm as a rock&#8212;he would not even take an oath to not fight for either side&#8212;they held him about 8 months&#8212;then he was very sick, scurvy, &amp; they exchanged him &amp; he came up from Richmond here to hospital, here I got acquainted with him&#8212;he is a large, slow, good natured man (somehow made me often think of father), shrewd, very little to say&#8212;wouldn't talk to any body but me&#8212;his whole thought was to get back &amp; fight, he was not fit to go, but he has gone back to Tennessee&#8212;he spent two days with his wife &amp; young one there &amp; then to his regiment&#8212;he writes to me frequently, &amp; I to him&#8212; he is not fit to soldier, for the rebels have destroyed his health &amp; strength (though he is only 23 or 4), but nothing will keep him from his regiment, &amp; fighting&#8212;he is uneducated, but as sensible a young man as I ever met, &amp; understands the whole question&#8212;well, mother, Jack Barker is the most genuine Union man I have ever yet met&#8212;I asked him once very gravely why he didn't take the southern oath &amp; get his liberty&#8212;if he didn't think it was foolish to be so stiff &amp;c&#8212;I never saw such a look as he gave me, he thought I was in earnest&#8212;the old devil himself couldn't have had put a worse look in his eyes&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I have no doubt there are quite a good many just such men&#8212;he is now down there with his regiment, (one of his brothers was killed)&#8212;when he fails in strength, he gets the Colonel to detach him to do teamster's duty for a few days, on a march till he recruits his strength&#8212;but he always carries his gun with him&#8212;in a battle he is always in the ranks&#8212;then he is so sensible, such decent manly ways, nothing shallow or mean, (he must have been a giant in health, but now he is weaker, has a cough too)&#8212;Mother, can you wonder at my getting so attached to such men, with such love, especially when they show it to me&#8212;some of them on their dying beds, &amp; in the very hour of death or just the same when they recover, or partially recover&#8212;I never knew what American young men were till I have been in the hospitals&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, I have got writing on&#8212;there is nothing new with me, just the same old thing&#8212;as I suppose it is with you there&#8212;Mother, how is Andrew, I wish to hear all about him&#8212;I do hope he is better, &amp; that it will not prove any thing so bad&#8212;I will write to him soon myself, but in the mean time you must tell him to not put so much faith in medicine, drugs I mean, as in the true curative things, namely diet &amp; careful habits, breathing good air, &amp;c&#8212;you know I wrote in a former letter<ptr target="loc.00789_n5"/> what is the cause &amp; foundation of the diseases of the throat, &amp; what must be the remedy that goes to the bottom of the thing&#8212;sudden attacks &amp;c are to be treated with applications &amp; medicines, but diseases of a seated character are not to be cured by them, only perhaps a little relieved, (&amp; often aggravated, made firmer)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dearest mother, I hope you yourself are well, &amp; getting along good&#8212;About the letter in the Times,<ptr target="loc.00789_n6"/> I see ever since I sent it they have been very crowded with news that must be printed&#8212;I think they will give it yet. I hear there is a new paper in Brooklyn,<ptr target="loc.00789_n7"/> or to be one&#8212;I wish Jeff would send me some of the first numbers without fail, &amp; a stray Eagle in same parcel to make up the 4 ounces&#8212;I was glad to hear Mat was going to write me a good long letter&#8212;every letter from home is so good, when one is away&#8212;(I often see the men crying in the hospital when they get a letter)&#8212;Jeff too I want him to write whenever he can, &amp; not forget the new paper&#8212;we are having pleasant weather here, it is such a relief from that awful heat&#8212;(I can't think of another such seige without feeling sick at the thought)&#8212;Mother, I believe I told you I had written to Mrs. Price&#8212;do you see Emma? Are the soldiers still on Fort Greene?<ptr target="loc.00789_n8"/>
            </p>
            <p>Well, mother, I have writ quite a letter&#8212;it is between 2 &amp; 3 o'clock&#8212;I am in Major Hapgood's all alone&#8212;from my window I see all the Potomac, &amp; all around Washington&#8212;Major &amp; all gone down in the Army to pay troops &amp; I keep house&#8212;I am invited to dinner to-day at 4 o'clock at a Mr Boyle's<ptr target="loc.00789_n9"/>&#8212;I am going&#8212;(hope we shall have something good)&#8212;dear Mother, I send you my love, &amp; same to Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all, not forgetting Mannahatta (who I hope is a help &amp; comfort to her grandmother)&#8212;well I must scratch off in a hurry, for it is nearly a hour later than I thought&#8212;good bye for present, dear mother&#8212;</p>
