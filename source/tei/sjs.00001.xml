               <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your letter from Dewittville came safe, about nine days ago&#8212;&amp; I have been expecting to hear from you since. Byron, I am still here, and as far as appears at present am likely to remain employed here, through the fall&#8212;but may ask for leave of absence for two or three weeks before long. There is a great stream of Southerners comes in here day after day, to get <hi rend="italic">pardoned</hi>
               <ptr target="sjs.00001_n1"/>&#8212;All the rich, and all high officers of the rebel army cannot do any thing, cannot buy or sell, &amp;c. until they have special pardons&#8212;(that is hitting them where they <hi rend="italic">live</hi>)&#8212;so they all send or come up here in squads, old &amp; young, men &amp; women&#8212;</p>
            <p>They come to this office to get them&#8212;sometimes the rooms are filled with a curious gathering&#8212;I talk with them frequently, listen to their stories, descriptions, opinions &amp;c. &amp;c&#8212;As you know, almost every thing of that sort (&amp; especially all odd characters) are interesting to me&#8212;Some 4 or 5000 pardons have been passed through here&#8212;but the President hasn't signed more than 200&#8212;The rest are all blank yet&#8212;Andy Johnson seems disposed to be in no hurry about it&#8212;What I learn &amp; know about him (the President), I think he is a <hi rend="italic">good man</hi>.<ptr target="sjs.00001_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Byron, there is nothing new or special with me. I have changed my back room to the front room, &amp; have my meals sent up by the landlady&#8212;She gives me very good grub, &amp; I like it, both room &amp; board, ($32.50 a month)&#8212;The last ten or twelve days here have been very pleasant &amp; sufficiently cool&#8212;after the melting hot summer&#8212;I am writing this in the office, by my big window, looking out on a splendid view across &amp; down the Potomac for several miles, &amp; over into Virginia, along Arlington heights&#8212;The trees, grass, river, &amp; sky are splendid.</p>
            <p>Well, my dear comrade, how are you, &amp; how does it go? You must write &amp; let me hear about you&#8212;&amp; I shall want to know also if you get this. I wish it was so we could see each other, &amp; be together once in a while. Well, Byron, I must close. I send you my love, &amp; God bless you, dearest comrade&#8212;Write soon, dear son, &amp; give me all particulars.<ptr target="sjs.00001_n3"/>
