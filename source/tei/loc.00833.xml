               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I cannot write you any thing about the 51st, as I have not heard a word&#8212;I felt much disturbed yesterday afternoon, as Major Hapgood came up from the Paymaster General's office, &amp; said that news had arrived that Burnside was killed, &amp; that the 9th Corps had had a terrible slaughter&#8212;he said it was believed at the Paymaster general's office&#8212;Well I went out to see what reliance there was on it&#8212;the rumor soon spread over town, &amp; was believed by many&#8212;but as near as I can make it out, it proves to be one of those unaccountable stories that get started these times&#8212;Saturday night we heard that Grant was routed completely &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;so that's the way the stories fly&#8212;I suppose you have the same big lies there in Brooklyn&#8212;Well the truth is sad enough, without adding any thing to it&#8212;but Grant is not destroyed yet, but I think is going into Richmond yet, but the cost is terrible&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I have not felt well at all the last week&#8212;I had spells of deathly faintness, and bad trouble in my head too, &amp; sore throat, (quite a little budget, ain't they?)&#8212;My head was the worst, though I don't know, the faint weak spells were not very pleasant&#8212;but I feel so much better this forenoon I believe it has passed over&#8212;There is a very horrible collection in Armory Building, (in Armory Square hosp.) about 200 of the worst cases you ever see, &amp; I had been probably too much with them&#8212;it is enough to melt the heart of a stone&#8212;over one third of them are amputation cases&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, poor Oscar Cunningham is gone at last&#8212;he is the 82d Ohio boy, (wounded May 3d '63)&#8212;I have written so much of him I suppose you feel as if you almost knew him&#8212;I was with him Saturday forenoon &amp; also evening&#8212;he was more composed than usual, could not articulate very well&#8212;he died about 2 o'clock Sunday morning&#8212;very easy they told me, I was not there&#8212;It was a blessed relief, his life has been misery for months&#8212;the cause of death at last was the system absorbing the pus, the bad matter, instead of discharging it from wound&#8212;I believe I told you in last letter I was quite blue from the deaths of several of the poor young men I knew well, especially two I had strong hopes of their getting up&#8212;things are going pretty badly with the wounded&#8212;They are crowded here in Washington in immense numbers, &amp; all those that come up from the Wilderness, &amp; that region, arrived here so neglected, &amp; in such plight, it was awful&#8212;(those that were at Fredericksburgh &amp; also from Belle Plaine)&#8212;The papers are full of puffs, &amp;c. but the truth is, the largest proportion of worst cases got little or no attention&#8212;we receive them here with their wounds full of worms&#8212;some all swelled &amp; inflamed, many of the amputations have to be done over again&#8212;one new feature is that many of the poor afflicted young men are crazy, every ward has some in it that are wandering&#8212;they have suffered too much, &amp; it is perhaps a privilege that they are out of their senses&#8212;Mother, it is most too much for a fellow, &amp; I sometimes wish I was out of it&#8212;but I suppose it is because I have not felt first rate myself&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am going to write to George to-day, as I see there is a daily mail to White House&#8212;O I must tell you that we get the wounded from our present field near Richmond much better than we did from the Wilderness &amp; Fredericksburgh&#8212;We get them now from White House, they are put on boats there, &amp; come all the way here, about 160 or 70 miles&#8212;White House is only twelve or fifteen miles from the field, &amp; is our present depot &amp; base of supplies&#8212;It is very pleasant here to-day, a little cooler than it has been&#8212;a good rain shower last evening&#8212;the western reg'ts continue to pour in here, the 100 days men, may go down to front, to guard posts, trains, &amp;c&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, Mother, how do things go on with you all&#8212;it seems to me if I could only be home two or three days, &amp; have some good teas with you &amp; Mat, &amp; set in the old basement a while, &amp; have a good time &amp; talk with Jeff, &amp; see the little girls, &amp;c&#8212;I should be willing to keep on afterward among these sad scenes for the rest of the summer&#8212;but I shall remain here until this Richmond campaign is settled, any how, unless I get sick, &amp; I don't anticipate that&#8212;Mother dear, I hope you are well &amp; in fair spirits&#8212;you must try to&#8212;have you heard from sister Han?</p>

            <p>You know I am living at 502 Pennsylvania av. (near 3d st)&#8212;it is not a very good place, I don't like it so well as I did cooking my own grub&#8212;&amp; the air is not good&#8212;Jeff, you must write&#8212;</p>
