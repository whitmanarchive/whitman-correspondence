         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00611_n100"/> suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten by me.</p>
            <p>I have entirely recovered from my wounds long since and have been at work part of the time and attending commercial school.  I have been at work about six weeks, consequently my hand is not in very good condition for writing.</p>
            <p>I have been promising myself to write to you ever since I returned home but have failed to keep my promise till now.</p>
            <p>I intend to go south in about two months and if I come that way I will stop and see you.</p>
            <p>I would like to know what chance I would have to go into business with a few hundred dollars capital.  If I can not go into anything there, what do you think of my going further south, say to Savannah.</p>
            <p>I want you when you write to tell me just what you think about it.</p>
            <p>I do not know as you will be much interested by receiving this letter from me but I would like to hear from you very much.  yours with respect.</p>
