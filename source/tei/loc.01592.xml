                <salute>Dear boy &amp; comrade,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I sent off a letter to you yesterday noon, but towards evening Mr. Davis brought me 
                up from the p. o. yours of the 15th,<ptr target="loc.01592_n2"/> which I was so glad to get that you shall 
                have an answer right off. After the flurry of snow I told you of yesterday morning, 
                we had a pleasant clear afternoon. I took a long walk, partly through the woods, 
                and enjoyed it much. The weather was pretty cold &amp; sharp, &amp; remains so yet. 
                As I left my overcoat in Washington, I have been compelled to get something here—so I have bought me a great iron-grey shawl, which I find very acceptable. 
                I always had doubts about a shawl, but have already got used to mine, &amp; like it 
                first rate. In the evening, I went by invitation to a party of ladies &amp; gentlemen—mostly ladies. We had a warm, animated talk, among other things about Spiritualism. 
                I talked too, indeed went in like a house afire. It was good exercise—for the fun of the thing. 
                I also made love to the women, &amp; flatter myself that I created at least one impression—wretch 
                &amp; gay deceiver that I am. Then away late—lost my way—wandered over the city, 
                &amp; got home after one o'clock.<ptr target="loc.01592_n3"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>The truth is, Peter, that I am here at present times mainly in the midst of female women, 
                some of them young &amp; jolly—&amp; meet them most every evening in company—&amp; the way in 
                which this aged party comes up to the scratch &amp; cuts out the youthful parties 
                &amp; fills their hearts with envy is absolutely a caution. You would be astonished, 
                my son, to see the brass &amp; coolness, &amp; the capacity of flirtation &amp; carrying on 
                with the girls—I would never have believed it of myself. Brought here by destiny, 
                surrounded in this way—&amp; as I in self defence would modestly state—sought for, 
                seized upon &amp; ravingly devoured by these creatures—&amp; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> nice &amp; smart some of them are, 
                &amp; handsome too—there is nothing left for me—is there—but to go in. Of course, 
                young man, you understand, it is all on the square. My going in amounts to just talking 
                &amp; joking &amp; having a devil of a jolly time, carrying on—that's all. They are all 
                as good girls as ever lived. I have already had three or four such parties here—which, you will certainly admit, considering my age &amp; heft, to say nothing of 
                my reputation, is doing pretty well.
            </p>
            
            <p>I go about quite a good deal—this is as handsome a city, as I ever saw. 
                Some of the streets run up steep hills. Except in a few of the business streets, 
                where the buildings are compact—in nine-tenths of the city, every house stands separate, 
                &amp; has a little or quite a deal of ground about it, for flowers, &amp; for shade or fruit trees, 
                or a garden. I never saw such a prosperous looking city—but of course no grand 
                public buildings like Washington.
            </p>
            
            <p>This forenoon I have been out away down along the banks of the river &amp; cove, 
                &amp; making explorations generally. All is new to me, &amp; I returned quite tired. 
                I have eat a hearty dinner. Then I thought I would come up &amp; sit a while in my room. 
                But as I did not feel like reading, I concluded to write this precious screed. 
                Fortunate young man, to keep getting such instructive letters—aint you? 
                It is now four o'clock &amp; bright &amp; cool, &amp; I have staid in long enough. 
                I will sally forth, on a walk, &amp; drop this in the P. O. before supper. 
                So long, dear Pete—&amp; my love to you as always, always.
