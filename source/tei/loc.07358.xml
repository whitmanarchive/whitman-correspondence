            <p>Your letter of 26th<ptr target="loc.07358_n2"/> just to hand.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for the enclosures&#8212;Kennedy's<ptr target="n3039"/> letter and the
                slips from "Times" &#38; "Inquirer".<ptr target="loc.07358_n3"/></p>

            <p>Scovel's<ptr target="n1049"/> long "Talk with Whitman"<ptr target="loc.07358_n4"/> is about as little like W. as
                could well be&#8212;Guess we must stand it. There mis-representations will all be
                set right by and by. The real W.W. will undoubtedly emerge at last and be known of
                all men. Scovel's cussedness is damnable because he evidently means so well and does
                so badly. With (apparently) the best intention in the world, and thinking all the
                time that he is doing a big thing, he paints you as a 3d or 4th rate man all from
                pure inability to appreciate either W.W. or the quality of his (Scovel's) writing.
                But these little skits are <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi>. The <hi
                    rend="underline">real Whitman</hi> will duly appear to the next and all
                following generations&#8212;do not be the least uneasy</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_es.00780.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>about that. Sorry to hear of even partial return of grip&#8212;hope it will not stay
                long with you.</p>

            <p>All well and going well here. Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> working away at meter,
                expects to have same on the market with a few weeks. We have had some aggravating
                delays. A machine of ours stuck fast somewhere down the Hudson&#8212;been stuck the
                last 3 weeks &#38; still no word of it.&#8212;on account of strike I guess. So
                    Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> is back in England&#8212;I am real sorry he did
                not come along this way</p>
