         <p>Did you arrive home safely, dear Walt? and did you vote?
            did you vote seven time "as the Count did when he first become a citizen of these United
               States?<ptr target="loc.00940_n2"/> If not in your own person, I hope that you caused
            as many as seven raving Democrats to vote right this time, however as the result was all
            right we argue that you did your part.</p>
         <p>Now, now, Walt, are you aware that your "ten days" expire to-morrow? Not that I at all
            expect to see you then for ten days would be a short time to stay at home after nearly a
            year's absence,&#8212;but we have <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00600_large.jpg"
               type="verso"/>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00601_large.jpg" type="recto"/>been counting the days
            in the <hi rend="underline">very faintest</hi> hope that you might come then.</p>
         <p>Mr. Eldridge comes as usual every evening, and we always ask each other&#8212;"have you heard
            from Walt?"<ptr target="loc.00940_n3"/> He has sent you two letters, one the next day
            after you left, and one since. We have drank your health on several occasions, and in a
            variety of liquids, <hi rend="underline">tea</hi> on one occasion.</p>
         <p>By the way, all of the Piatts including the sweet Patsy &amp; the baby have dined with
            us since you left.<ptr target="loc.00940_n4"/> I shall save all details to tell you when
            you come. But you were asked for, and we all wished you present.<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
               facs="loc_jc.00602_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf003r"
               facs="loc_jc.00603_large.jpg" type="recto"/>Of course Mr. Eldridge &amp; Mrs. Cooper
            formed two of the dinner party.<ptr target="nyp.00185_n2"/> Mrs. C. is still with me,
            being detained much longer than she expected to be, for which I am very glad. I shall
            not know how to get along without her, especially while you are gone. She is very bright
            and keeps us alive, she knows how to cook nice things too, and has exercised her genius
            for me several times, and if you will come back before she is gone, we will have a nice
            dinner for you.</p>
         <p>I fully intended to be able to tell you something about your boys in hospital, but I
            have had so bad a cold since you left <pb xml:id="leaf003v"
               facs="loc_jc.00604_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf004r"
               facs="loc_jc.00605_large.jpg" type="recto"/>and such an annoying troublesome cough
            with it, that I have not been able to go to see them. They must miss you sadly, poor
            boys, I pity them.</p>
         <p>How did you find all at home? Did your good mother look as when you left her? &amp; did
            you remember to give her my love? how did little Hattie look? had she grown much? &amp;
            what do you think of the <hi rend="underline">new</hi> baby? did you kiss them both for me?
            If not you must.</p>
         <p>How about all the other members of the family? I hope you found all better than you
            expected. You know I feel personally acquainted with each <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
               facs="loc_jc.00606_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf005r"
               facs="loc_jc.00607_large.jpg" type="recto"/>member of your family.</p>
         <p>And what about your New York boys? Of course you have seen all, and have had that great
               <hi rend="underline">time</hi> which we are to hear all about when you come back.
            Indeed, won't you have "lots" to tell us! You know you must come back prepared to give
            us a full account.</p>
         <p>Have you seen Mrs. Price.<ptr target="loc.00940_n6"/> I wrote her the very day you left.
            Do you find her much worse than when you left last year?</p>
         <p>And Walt, have you seen Mr. Howells?<ptr target="loc.00940_n7"/> If not I beg that you
            will, and with all the skill and talent of which you <pb xml:id="leaf005v"
               facs="loc_jc.00608_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf006r"
               facs="loc_jc.00609_large.jpg" type="recto"/>are master do what you can to disenchant
            him with those people. I know more about it than when you were here, and I assure you
            that you will be rendering a service not only to Mrs. H. &amp; the family, but to all
            who care for him if you can only get him out of this. If he could but know the real
            truth in regard to "the great head" and leader of the reform it would surely open his
            eyes. He evidently thinks Mr. A. a "great light" &amp; a saint of a man, sincere and
            true. Oh! can't he be enlightened? It is awful, and unless his eyes are soon opened I
            don't see what will be the end. I depend on you<pb xml:id="leaf006v"
               facs="loc_jc.00610_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf007r"
               facs="loc_jc.00611_large.jpg" type="recto"/>Walt, to see him, at any rate, &amp; your
            own intuition will tell you whether you can do more, but I feel that you can. He has
            great regard for your opinions of people and things.</p>
         <p>William is well as usual, he is at the office or would send lots of love.<ptr
               target="loc.00940_n8"/> Mrs. Cooper has gone in to the other house to dress for
            dinner, or she too, would send love. Do you know that in the innocence of her heart she
            fully believes that you are going to stop and see her on your return through
            Philadelphia, and <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have not the heart to undeceive her, and tell
            her what a <hi rend="underline">promising</hi> youth you are <pb xml:id="leaf007v"
               facs="loc_jc.00612_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf008r"
               facs="loc_jc.00613_large.jpg" type="recto"/>so I don't see but that you really must
            make the promised visit,&#8212;&amp; you would have a very good time, I assure you of that
            beforehand. She wants me to go home with her, but I doubt if I shall. Can't afford
            it.</p>
         <p>By the way, one bit of intelligence in regard to our dear friend and neighbor Gwynne I
            must tell you.<ptr target="loc.00940_n9"/> They think of moving &amp; renting the house
            up here, &amp; a lady whom I know came to look at it. G. was much pleased at the idea of
            having such a nice family as hers for tenants, &amp; offered to rent it for <pb
               xml:id="leaf008v" facs="loc_jc.00614_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf009r"
               facs="loc_jc.00615_large.jpg" type="recto"/>one hundred dollars a month unfurnished.
            The lady politely declined &amp; told him that she rents her present house <hi
               rend="underline">furnished</hi> for that sum. Mrs. G. &amp; the new baby are well. I
            can't think of any more news to tell you.</p>
         <p>To tell you that we miss you <hi rend="underline">awfully</hi> would not be news would it?
            You expected that, but I do have a most uncomfortable sense of "goneness" all the time,
            &amp; I shall welcome you home here <hi rend="underline">very heartily</hi>.
         </p>
         <p>Can I do any thing for you in your absence?</p>
         <p>Don't forget the three things you were to bring for <hi rend="underline">my</hi> especial <pb xml:id="leaf009v"
               facs="loc_jc.00616_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf010r"
               facs="loc_jc.00617_large.jpg" type="recto"/>benefit. The picture, letter, &amp; "Drum
            Taps"&#8212;</p>
         <p>Now good bye&#8212;and very much love from us all. I have said nothing of Jeannie, she is
            not as well as I want to see her looking, she is out playing, or I would ask her what
            message to you. She asks for you often, and hopes you will soon be back.</p>
