            <p>Here I sit in my favourite seat on a bank overlooking Rivington Lake—(where 
                we sat Sunday afternoon, May 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi>.)
                I must write to you tonight (my last chance this week) but as it is a beautiful evening 
                I decided to ramble out here first—to enjoy the
                lovely scene &amp; the fresh air. And now while resting here I may as well draft my letter.</p>                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01220_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                
            <p>The sun is setting behind me—the lake below flecked with ripples reflects the 
                gray blue sky—the gently undulating country just beyond
                green &amp; wooded here &amp; there—with purple moorland hills behind. 
                To the right, across the lake, is the charming little hamlet of
                Rivington, with the Pike beyond.—The birds are singing their evening concert—a thrush 
                especially calling loudly close by.</p>            
            <p>A most peaceful &amp; sweet ending to a glorious day. No gorgeous display of sunset hues, 
                but sober, calm, vital &amp; beautiful.               
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01221_large.jpg" type="recto"/>                
                L. of G. is with me &amp; my thoughts are of <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. 
                Especially so as we have received today your account of your birthday
                "spree" in Camden<ptr target="loc.04326_n4"/>—(celebrated by us <hi rend="underline">here</hi>)</p>            
            <p>Dr. J.<ptr target="n4102"/> came to see me this morning, in great delight,—to 
                <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> me your kind good letter just received,<ptr target="loc.04718_n2"/> &amp; to consult me as to the best way of
                copying it. He also <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> me a good letter he had received from Warry.<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/>
                We have wondered many a time how you got through that day, &amp; looked forward
                to some account of it. It was a great pleasure to us to learn that you triumphed so 
                grandly over your infirmities                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01222_large.jpg" type="verso"/>                
                &amp; that the dinner was such a great success. We rejoice too that you were apparently 
                no worse for it next day, &amp; hope that you have kept better since.
                Dr. J. came to see me again at noon, &amp; in the afternoon brought me one of two copies of 
                the "Camden Post" received from Warry.</p>           
            <p>It pleased us very much to learn from Warry's letter that you had expressed a wish that we, 
                too, were all present That could not be, but our thoughts 
                were with you, &amp; our heart's best love &amp; good will.</p>                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01223_large.jpg" type="recto"/>               
            <p>I hope that your 73<hi rend="underline">rd</hi> year, so auspiciously begun, 
                may be marked by greater immunity from pain, by some recovery of strength, &amp;
                by further accession of lovers &amp; friends.</p>           
            <p>I do wish to hear that you are able to get out more &amp; that you are reaping benefit 
                from the summer weather.</p>           
            <p>Sure am I always—as I ramble here—that nature has found no voice to express 
                her like yours—as also that she transcends <hi rend="underline">all</hi>
                expression, &amp; promises new &amp; diviner meanings evermore, as we advance 
                on our endless course.</p>

            <p>May this letter, written in her presence, convey some slight aroma of her cheer 
                &amp; beauty to your room.—If only you sat here with me now.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>God bless you, &amp; my heart's best love to you always.</salute>
