               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Jeff must have got a letter<ptr target="loc.00762_n1"/> from me yesterday, containing George's last letter.<ptr target="loc.00762_n2"/> The news of your sickness, and the strange silence of Han made me feel somewhat gloomy. I wrote to George yesterday, conveying the news&#8212;and to-day I have sent him another letter, with much more comfortable news, for I was so glad to hear from Han, (her letter, enclosed in Jeff's, received this morning) that I wrote him right away, and sent Han's letter.<ptr target="loc.00762_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mother, I am quite in hopes George will get a furlough&#8212;may-be my expectations are unfounded, but I almost count on it.<ptr target="loc.00762_n4"/> I am so glad this morning to hear you are no worse, but changed for the better&#8212;and dear sister Mat too, and sissy, I am so glad to think they are recovering.<ptr target="loc.00762_n5"/> Jeff's enclosure of $10 through Mr. Lane,<ptr target="loc.00762_n6"/> from the young engineers, for the soldiers in hospitals, the most needy cases, came safe of course&#8212;I shall acknowledge it to Mr. Lane to-morrow. Mother, I have written so much about hospitals, that I will not write any in this letter.</p>
            <p>We have had bad weather enough here lately to most make up for the delightful weather we had for five weeks after I came from home.</p>
            <p>Mother, I do hope you will be careful, and not get any relapse&#8212;and hope you will go on improving. Do you then think of getting new apartments, after the 1st of May? I suppose Jeff has settled about the lot<ptr target="loc.00762_n7"/>&#8212;it seems to me first rate as an investment&#8212;the kind of house to build is quite a consideration, (if any house,) I should build <hi rend="italic">a regular Irish shanty</hi> myself, two rooms, and an end shed&#8212;I think that's luxury enough, since I have been down in the army.</p>
            <p>Well, mother, I believe I will not fill out the sheet this time, as I want to go down without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter, and this one.</p>
            <p>Good bye, dear mother,</p>
