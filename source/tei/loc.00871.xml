         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00871_n100"/> send to you by the same mail which takes this note, a copy of my last poem The Picture of St. John.  I do not know whether the subject of the poem (the growth and development of the artist-nature, and its relation to life) will much interest you, but I hope you will here and there find something drawn immediately from nature.  I am, at least, not aware that anything in the book is simulated or forced:  whether successful or not, it is an honest conscientious effort.</p>
            <p>I value, above all things, sincerity  in literature; hence I am

               not one of those who overlook your remarkable powers of expression, your broad, vital reverence for humanity, because some things you have said repel them.  The age is over-squeamish, and, for my part, I prefer the honest nude to the suggestive half-draped.  I think the proper question to be asked is:  does a certain thing need to be said?  If so, let it be said!  The worst form of immorality, I have found, veils itself in decent words.</p>
            <p>There is one quality I recognize in you, which warmly and constantly attracts me.  That is, your deep and tender reverence for Man&#8212;your <choice><orig>un-

               wearied</orig><reg>unwearied</reg></choice>, affectionate, practical fraternity.  There is too little of this quality in the world, and the race will be better and happier in proportion as it is manifested.</p>
            <p>I shall be in Washington on the 27th of December, to lecture, and hope that I shall then be able to meet you personally.  If you can spare me an hour or two after the lecture, you will greatly oblige</p>
