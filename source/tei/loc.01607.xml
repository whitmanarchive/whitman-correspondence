                <salute>My dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>      
            <p>I can hardly understand how I have left your most welcome letter so long unanswered.
                In Paris two months ago I saw one morning in a newspaper that "The American Poet,
                Walt Whitman would shortly visit England", &amp; there &amp; then I sat down &amp;
                wrote part of a letter to you, but the weariness of illness (I was ailing a good
                deal) caused it to remain unended &amp; unsent. Now I have just heard from Mr.
                Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> that there is, or may be, a fair chance of your coming 
                to us, &amp; of your giving readings from your poems. As far as my own opinion goes, 
                I would say that there is a certainty of success, a sufficient success at the least, 
                &amp; perhaps a complete one, in Dublin. Do come. You do not know how welcome you 
                would be to many of us. I need not say 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01492.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                that if you would come to our house in Dublin my wife &amp; I would be made abundantly 
                happy, &amp; would remember 1872 as a year good to think of.</p>
            <p>There are several things for which I owe you thanks&#8212;two copies of "Democratic
                Vistas"<ptr target="n4122"/> &amp; newspapers from time to time. Each I assure you has been valued,
                (though my thanks are tardy); &amp; your letter has been read or heard of by those
                who would care for its contents.</p>
            <p>Mr Burroughs tells me that you have been not as well as heretofore since the great
                summer heat. I trust it is only a slight &amp; temporary yielding of your health.
                You will be best able to feel yourself whether a run across the Atlantic, &amp; the
                absorbing of new life &amp; scenery in England &amp; Ireland, would not be 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01492.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                just the tonic you require. We at all events are interested in believing this, &amp; 
                think that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> are just the communicator of vitality &amp; 
                joy that <hi rend="underline">we</hi> require. I mean by this, besides its more direct 
                personal meaning, that such influences as yours are precisely what our poetry in its
                latent developments needs to make it sane &amp; masculine. And I have not a doubt that 
                your personal presence in England would do much towards bringing the time when the 
                recognition of your power &amp; soundness in art &amp; literature must become general.</p>
            <p>I have written to Mr Burroughs anything about myself that I thought would interest him, 
                &amp; I will not write the same again to you. also I have sent him two or three things 
                I have written, &amp; if he thinks you would care to see them he will give them to you.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01492.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I will write to you again before long. I hope you will continue to let me see or hear of 
                such things of yours as otherwise I might miss. "The Mystic Trumpeter"<ptr target="n0429"/> 
                I was very glad to have seen.</p>
            <p>But chiefly I hope to hear that you are coming, &amp; coming to us.</p>
            <p>My address is as before <address>
                <addrLine>50, Wellington Road,</addrLine> 
                <addrLine>Dublin.</addrLine></address></p>
            <p>This has been a year of comparative loss to me as regards physical health, but I am well 
                again now; &amp; in other respects it has been a year of gain &amp; progress. But I don't 
                find in the least find that, with progress, I slip aside or away from your poems.</p>
