                <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>After the experiences of the last three days I "feel to" address you thus&#8212;</p>
            <p>
                I have so much to tell you in this letter that I scarcely know where &#38; how to begin.
                Suppose we begin at the beginning!</p>
            <p>
                Our dear friend J. W. Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> arrived at Liverpool 
                by the <hi rend="underline">City of Berlin</hi><ptr target="loc.08291_n4"/>
                on Friday last (Nov<hi rend="underline">r</hi> 13<hi rend="underline">th</hi>)<ptr target="loc.02530_n7"/> &#38; intimated
                his arrival by sending me a telegram&#8212;</p>
            <p>"How's your health?"
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02530.002_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                to which I replied&#8212;"Brawly, thank'ee for speirin,' hoo's a' yersel'?"</p>
            <p>He stayed with Will Law<ptr target="loc.02497_n3"/> (who lives at Liverpool) all night &#38; next morning
                he went direct home to Anderton as he had got a little cold during the severe storm 
                of Queenstown wh. prevented them calling there as usual &#38; he wanted to rest awhile.</p>
            <p>On Sunday Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> went over to see him 
                (I being too busy to get away) &#38; on Monday
                he came by arrangement to Bolton.</p>
            <p>I met him at the Station
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02530.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                &#38; oh wasn't it a gladsome reunion after our twelve weeks' separation? 
                Arm in arm the dear good fellow &#38; I walked down the street; &#38; then 
                were opened the flood gates of our long 
                pent up talk,<ptr target="loc.02530_n11"/> the rim of whose vast ocean we seem even now to have merely edged.  
                It will take weeks to explore it &#38; to put me upon equal terms with him.</p>
            <p>I brought him here to tea &#38; to stay the night with us &#38; just 
                as we sat down to tea I received
                your kind p.c. of Nov<hi rend="underline">r</hi> 5<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02530_n9"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02530.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                in wh. you say "We all miss him" (J.W.W.) "&#38; hate to have him go." 
                Pointing to that sentence I said&#8212;"Do you see that,
                Will?" "Yes" he replied "and I'm proud of that I tell you."</p>
            <p>Coming so opportunely your p.c. seemed like a personal greeting from you to us both &#38; I now
                thank you very heartily for your kindness in sending it.</p>
            <p>We were both pleased to receive it &#38; to note that you were then "about the same" wh,
                under your circumstances is good news tho' not the best we desire to hear.

                After tea Will Law came in from Liverpool &#38; at 7 p.m. 
                we all made our way to the house of W.A.
                Ferguson<ptr target="loc.02526_n3"/> who had kindly invited all the boys<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/> there 
                to give Wallace our Reception upon his return from America. 
                There was a good muster, those present being:&#8212;J.W. Wallace,
                Fred Wild, R.K. Greenhalgh,<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> Sam Hodgkinson,<ptr target="loc.04829_n1"/> 
                W.A. Ferguson, Thos Shorrock<ptr target="loc.02448_n8"/> 
                George Humphreys,<ptr target="loc.02495_n2"/> W.M. Law, 
                J.B. Johnstone<ptr target="loc.02530_n3"/> Wentworth Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>
                &#38; self&#8212;FRC Hutton<ptr target="loc.02454_n3"/> was absent thro' slight illness.
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02530.006_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                 After the bustle &#38; excitement of mutual greetings &#38;c were over 
                 J.W. Wallace opened his bag &#38; distributed the various presents
                 he had brought with him for the boys&#8212;something for each &#38; 
                 every one&#8212;copies of the pocketbook edition of
                <hi rend="underline">L of G</hi>,<ptr target="med.00869_n3"/> 
                "Good Bye"<ptr target="loc.02485_n5"/> 
                Dr Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> "Man's Moral Nature"<ptr target="loc.02443_n2"/> 
                (the D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> sent one to each 
                of the boys that he met while here) &#38; his "Walt Whitman"<ptr target="loc.02530_n6"/> as 
                well as copies of your autograph portraits &#38; of one that 
                J.W.W. got at London, Ont.</p>  
                    
              <p>Each book had an
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02530.007_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                appropriate inscription&#8212;most of them being in your own dear 
                handwriting&#8212;&#38; great was the joy of the boys at receiving
                these tokens of your love &#38; I think some of them will be writing to thank you.
                But the pick of the good things fell to my lot&#8212;a copy of 
                the Centennial (1876) Edition of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi><ptr target="loc.02527_n6"/>
                  &#38; <hi rend="underline">Two Rivulets</hi><ptr target="loc.08229_n3"/> (2 vols) from you; 
                a copy of the first edition of <hi rend="underline">L of G</hi>
                from J.W.W. wh he
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02530.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                  got from Johnston of New York<ptr target="n0336"/> (who I am glad to know
                hails originally from my dear old Annandale) 
                a piece of granite rock from the tomb<ptr target="loc.07329_n5b"/> 
                sent by M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &#38; the two
                portraits similar to those the others got,&#8212;a perfect 
                <hi rend="underline">embarras de richesse</hi><ptr target="loc.02530_n3"/> indeed!</p>
            <p>I cannot hope to be able to express my feeling to you, my good dear old friend, 
                for your munificent gifts. That I am
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02530.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                indeed profoundly grateful I would have you believe &#38; that I feel
                <hi rend="underline">your</hi> unexampled kindness to me in a way 
                that I cannot tell you of I can but assure you
                "Poor in wealth I am ever poor in thanks."
                But I know you will take the will for the deed &#38; add as much to the words "I thank you"
                as you deem fitting.&#8212;You have enriched my library as you had previously
                <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.02530.010_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                enriched my life  &#38; you have again filled my heart 
                to overflowing&#8212;God bless you now &#38; always!</p>
            <p>The "prise distribution" over we had supper after which settled down 
                to enjoy a regular, old fashioned "College meeting."</p>
            <p>Will Law (whom Dr Bucke described as "a whole circus") sang a song 
                I had written about "The Masther in Ameriky" (Will said he had received it 
                from Lord Tennyson!<ptr target="n0625"/>) after which
                <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02530.011_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                W.A. Ferguson called upon J.W. Wallace &#38; made a little speech. 
                The master thereupon rose &#38; entertained us for an hour &#38; a half 
                by reading extracts from his diary, referring mainly to his visits
                to Camden &#38; to you which were listened to with great 
                interest &#38; much enjoyed by us all To me the notes were an entrancing
                delight &#38; I followed every line with an interest wh. no other 
                there could possibly feel&#8212;for didn't I know almost every place
                <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc.02530.012_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                he mentioned &#38; couldnt I hear <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                speaking &#38; couldn't I feel your dear presence all the time? 
                Yes I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> relish that hour &#38; half
                I tell you &#38; it tasted <hi rend="underline">good</hi>.</p>
            <p>Since then JWW has kindly lent me his notes &#38; I have 
                read a great part of them &#38; I can honestly say that I have not read any thing
                for a very long time wh has so fascinated me &#38; held me spell bound</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf007r" facs="loc.02530.013_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>But <hi rend="underline">revenons a&#768; nos moutons</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02530_n10"/> After the reading of the notes 
            we had speeches, very short &#38; pithy from several of the boys, &#38; songs&#8212;two
            of these original ones by W. Dixon &#38; self of welcome home to the Master into the singing of 
            which we put the full complement of college enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Then more talk till 11.30 p.m. when we all left &#38; came home by train. Before leaving
            W.A. Ferguson opened a bottle of sparkling moselle &#38; we all
            <pb xml:id="leaf008r" facs="loc.02530.014_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                drank the healths of Walt Whitman, JW Wallace &#38; Mr &#38;
                M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Ferguson; &#38; thus 
                ended another of our pleasant social evenings &#38; a very memorable one too.</p>
            <p>JWW is looking well and seems to be much better than when we last saw him. 
                He is also in pretty buoyant spirits &#38; is very
                enthusiastic about you &#38; all the good folks who treated him so kindly at Camden</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf007v" facs="loc.02530.015_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Last Sunday night I went to St George's Church of wh F.R.C. Hutton is the vicar 
                when&#8212;it being Mayor's Sunday&#8212;he preached to the Mayor<ptr target="loc.02530_n5"/> 
                &#38; corporation. At the conclusion of his sermon he gave a long 
                quotation from the "Song of the Universal"<ptr target="loc.04701_n4"/> mentioning you by name.
                Several of the boys were there &#38; it was a pleasant experience 
                for us to hear you quoted from the pulpit of one of the principal churches
                in the town of Bolton&#8212;the first fruits of your great harvest.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf008v" facs="loc.02530.016_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I am sending Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> a short letter, but as I have not 
                time to give him the details of our proceedings I would like you to show this letter
                to him at your convenience.</p>
            <p>Also such parts of it to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> D. &#38; Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> 
                as you think may be of interest to them. It is a wretched scrawl I know
                but I have had to hurry over it to get it off by this mail. 
                So please pardon it &#38; its imperfections.</p>
            <p>With best love to you always
