                last
                week and have got three to day with
                the letter the letter man is most too
                clever the 50 cts and i have given him
                25 since) i find giving such people a small
                sum once in a while does much good
                and i always say thank you when he 
                gives me a letter i <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> know what

                than she thought she should but when
                they get keeping house she will get
