               <salute>Dear George,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I mailed you yesterday draft on Jay Cooke &amp; Co. for $510<ptr target="loc.00451_n1"/>&#8212;which I presume has come to hand</p>
            <p>How soon will your house be done&#8212;Do you intend Mother shall move there and live for awhile?<ptr target="loc.00451_n2"/>&#8212;[these] are the two questions that are in my mind just now&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mattie has a bad cough and I have had several first class physicians to see her and they all unite in saying that a trip east for a few months would cure her<ptr target="loc.00451_n3"/>&#8212;I have been very unfortunate in the selection of a house&#8212;and unfortunately have a lease of two years on it under very stringent papers too&#8212;It occurred to me that if Mother was not going to move I would try and get a furnished room in your neighborhood and send Mat and Jess on and if your new house was in the neighborhood of completion and you proposed to move in it I thought perhaps you could hire Mat a room in that.</p>
            <p>The house is damp and I cannot seem to bettr it. I have spent abt $125 on it trying to fix it. I'm in a pretty tight place and will have to "wiggle" out of it&#8212;I am looking just now for some sort of a boarding school to send Hat for a few months till I can see how the matter is going to turn out&#8212;. The doctors all unite in declaring that Mat has no disease of the lungs<ptr target="loc.00451_n4"/>&#8212;it is all in the bronchial tubes of the throat&#8212;of course it is going to be hard for us to break up just now&#8212;but I do not think it worth while to risk everything in trying to "stick" it out in a bad bargain&#8212;</p>
            <p>Give my love to Mother&#8212;tell her Mat has a letter written to her<ptr target="loc.00451_n5"/> that I will mail in the morning&#8212;and write me in regard to questions asked</p>
