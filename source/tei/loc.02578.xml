            <p>I have tried to snatch time to drop you a line for week's post, but
                from morning till night I am driven with work. Some days I really do not have five minutes spare time and go
                home so tired that I go to bed often before 9 o'clock, but I sleep well, and feel well, and everybody says I am
                growing fat. Scarcely that tho' however I weigh 30 lbs more than I did
                18 yrs ago. Alma<ptr target="n7016"/> went up to Pelham Bay Park today with a batch of her "Little Mothers" She 
                goes every Tuesday &amp; Friday
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02578.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Since she started her home made charity 
                she has taken over 2000. children out for a day on the Sound.</p>
               <p>Pelham Bay Park is between Westchester and New Rochelle and the Park Commissioner give 
                 Alma the use of a big mansion where
                the children meet and then romp in a great meadow and bathe in the Sound.
                She takes 30 to 60 at a time—the little waifs who take care of their younger brothers and sisters 
                all the year round while
                the mother is away earning the bread and butter.</p>
                <p>The name Alma called then "The Little Mothers" has been a talisman, 
                and scarcely a mail that she does not receive 
                from one to even as high as fifty dollars. Yesterday $5, came from Walla Walla, and Saturday $25 from
                Canandiaigua
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02578.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                from "The Misses Granger"<ptr target="loc.02578_n3"/>
                You remember their father and grandfather—celebrated Politicians—Francis Granger<ptr target="loc.02578_n2"/> 
                even in my day I remember as a boy.</p>
                <p>Strange to say never a dollar comes from the very rich. The big millionaires never send a 
                 dollar but it comes in small sums
                from all over, and she is able to foot all the expenses
                week after week and month after month.
                Hoping this will find you comfortable, and after many interruptions I will say good by.
