            <p>I was glad to hear by your postal that you are getting along without an increase of
                suffering. I wish that we all were near you, if so be that we might make an
                occasional hour brighter for you &#38; contribute to your exterior comforts. I see no
                time to be fixed for our return. Alys<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> proposes to go to
                Bryn Mawr College in September &#38; then will visit you. She will return to us if all
                is well in June 1890 with her diploma in her pocket.</p>
            <p>She, with her mother,<ptr target="n6170"/> a niece &#38; myself have been
                wandering <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00204_large.jpg" type="verso"/>this
                winter through Paris, Marseilles, the paradise of Nice and the Riviera, Rome,
                Florence, Venice, Milan, Switzerland &#38; home escaping thus
                the melancholy skies of London with its "pea soup" smoky
                atmosphere.</p> 
            <p>Logan<ptr target="loc.03841_n1"/> is doing well at his college at Oxford &#38; is
                studying faithfully in his vacation at home.</p>

                joys&#8212;but through much suffering. Her husband<ptr target="n6114"/> is in the
                new London City Council and is becoming prominent in abilities &#38; in his profession
                as a barrister.</p>

            <p>My old enemy "melancholia" spreads its vampire wings still over my life and will I
                presume go with me to the end. I take it quietly, as a physical disease simply &#38;
                live on remembering the phrase&#8212;"Its dogged that does it."</p>
            <p>So I have not much to tell. Yet it is fun to be in the midst of this great fermenting
                intense life of London as an on looker.</p>
            <p>I see with interest that you have issued a complete edition<ptr target="n4195"/> of your writings. You
                have many, many devoted friends in England among <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00206_large.jpg" type="verso"/>thoughtful people who would delight
                to see you here.</p>
            <p>Good bye, dear old friend,&#8212;Write me when your spirit moves you &#38; tell me how
                you are.</p>
            <p>With love from our children I am always</p>
