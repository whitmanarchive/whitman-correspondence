            <p>The best letter I have had for a long time was one this moment received written by
                Dr. Mitchell jr.<ptr target="loc.07644_n2"/> to Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> and
                forwarded me by the latter. This letter gives an acct of the analysis of your water
                and according to it your kidneys are <hi rend="underline">absolutely sound</hi>.
                There is nothing at all wrong with your water works except the enlarged prostate and
                the irritation consequent upon it. Your main difficulty is that on account of the
                enlargement of the prostate the bladder is not entirely emptied at any
                time&#8212;the urine retained undergoes decomposition and causes
                irritation&#8212;now what is wanted is that a catheter should be passed morning and
                evening and <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the water drawn</p>

                doctor after being instructed and provided with a proper catheter. I shall hope to
                hear that this matter is put upon a proper footing <hi rend="underline">at once</hi>
                and after this is done I have every confidence that I shall hear of your being more
                comfortable than for a long time back.</p>

            <p>All well here&#8212;glorious weather&#8212;but alas! our snow is gone and we have to
                use wheels again.</p>

            <p>All quiet with the meter<ptr target="loc.07230_n2"/>&#8212;too quiet! We do not get
                on nearly as fast as I should like but if we go slow I have <choice>

                </choice> that we are going <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> and now that I am
                relieved about your kidneys I have good hopes you will be with us to have the "good
                time coming"</p>
