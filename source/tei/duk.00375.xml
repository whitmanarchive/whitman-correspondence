               <salute>Dear Uncle</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>I<ptr target="duk.00375_n100"/> received you letter of Oct 7th &amp; here I am about to write you a reply.</p>
            <p>Times here have been rather busy Together with the Mass meetings &amp; a Bridial Tour that lasted a week. This was not any of my own luck but to accompany the newly married set was all  I was on the Company. I have received only this letter Oct 7th &amp; one writen to My Father of which both reached me the same mail. One came to me from the Regiment that one I answered &amp; a reply came to me. I intend to Answer all of your Kind letters. But this one I have neglected on account of my being a way from home so long. My letter to you at the time I was Poisoned has has not affected me any that time I looked the whole City of Washington over to find you&#8212;but I looked in vain</p>
            <p>My foot is quite well so much so that one can not tell of my being hit there. Shortly after I came to the city again to be Mounted on a Horse &amp; we layed in the Defences of Washington the time the Rebels came to attack the City. Then I went up the Shanandoah Valley untill the 24 day of August where I was Discharged. There was some very heavy fighting up there under Phil Sheridan<ptr target="duk.00375_n2"/> &amp; perhaps he has warmed the Johnnys since then. This Charles Davis I have not heard from since he left for home on a Furlough<ptr target="duk.00375_n3"/>. Wether he came back or not I can not tell</p>
            <p>Dear Uncle you gave me one of your Photographs &amp; I shall always carry it with me in Remembrance of a Kind Friend &amp; one who I have thought a good deal off.</p>
            <p>I hope that you will over look this neglect of mine in not writing you before this. This is rather bad writing any how &amp; I am a fraid you will bother yourself in reading what I have scribbled. My health is very good at present  Also the same I wish to you My best wishes gose with this to you</p>

               <salute>Yours very Respectfully</salute>
