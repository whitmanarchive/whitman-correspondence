            <p>Your letter came the other day, &amp; with the enclosure was very welcome.<ptr target="n0129"/> The papers came also. I am glad you keep well. I wish for you here daily, it is so cool &amp; salubrious. I imagined you off to some of the watering places. I was sorry I could not bring about the arrangement to have you come up to our place, but Emma has not been very well, &amp; though

            she said yes, I thought she was a little reluctant, and our own household economy was deranged by the cuttings up &amp; running off of the girl. But I shall not rest till I have you up there.</p>
            
            <p>I was much interested in the letters you enclosed. I must write to the Gilchrists.</p>
            
            <p>I made the trip down the Delaware the last of June, all alone; went only to Hancock on the Erie Road, about 50 miles. Had a pretty good time, tho' lonely. I was not quite a week on the river. I slept in my boat or under it all the time. The next week after I returned home I wrote up my trip
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01134.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            for the magazine, using the health &amp; strength I gained on the voyage. Since I have been here I have written an article on Nature &amp; the Poets, showing when our poets trip on their wood lore &amp; natural history, &amp; where they hit the mark. I catch them all napping. Emerson, Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, &amp;c. I shall have something to say about you, with extracts, but I cannot catch you in any mistake, as I wish I could, for that is my game. I wish I could also find a slip in <choice><orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>, or Tennyson, but I cannot according to my knowledge except where <choice><orig>Shakspear</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice> follows the unscientific thought of his times, as in his treatment of the honey bee.</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday I wrote a sort
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01134.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            of Pastoral Letter to The Tribune, but I doubt if they find it <choice><orig>worth while</orig><reg>worthwhile</reg></choice>, &amp; it is no matter.</p>
            
            <p>I will send you the proof of the article on the poets, before it goes into the magazine.</p>
            
            <p>There are two articles in the August Appleton's Journal that are worth glancing over, Arnold on Wordsworth &amp; Earl D. on Moose Hunting.<ptr target="loc.01134_n1"/> What simple good hearty fellows those English earls must be; not a false or conventional note in this one.</p>
            
            <p>The baby is doing well &amp; completely fills my heart. Wife is about as usual.</p>
            
            <p>I find I cannot read Whittier<ptr target="n1029"/> &amp; Longfellow<ptr target="n0367"/> &amp; Lowell<ptr target="n1026"/> with any satisfaction. Your poems spoil me for any but the greatest. Coming from them to you is like coming from a hothouse to the shore or the mountain. I know this is so &amp; is no pre-determined partiality of mine.</p>
