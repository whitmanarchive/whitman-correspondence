                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Instead of coming by boat, I came by the midnight train on Friday, &#38; got here
                about 7 on Saturday morning. Since then I have been to Concord &#38; discussed the
                New Poetry. The meeting took place after all in Dr. Emerson's house, <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03320.002.jpg" type="verso"/> instead of his
                father's. Old Mrs. Emerson (who is 85 years old, they tell me,) &#38; Ellen
                    Emerson,<ptr target="loc.03320_n1"/> formed part of the audience which though
                small was perhaps as remarkable as any I am ever likely to have. The discussion
                after my paper, in which Sanborn<ptr target="n0915"/> took a main part, was full of interest, &#38; there
                was a general agreement with my position, &#38; that part based on Leaves of Grass
                in especial. Mrs. Talcott Williams<ptr target="loc.05142_n5"/> gave me on Thursday
                evening two pictures of your house, inside &#38; out, one <choice>
                    <orig>shewing</orig>
                    <reg>showing</reg>    
                </choice> you seated by the window; &#38; on Sanborn's suggestion I took these to <choice>
                    <orig>shew</orig>
                    <reg>show</reg>
                </choice> to the people at the lecture, who were quite delighted with the glimpse of
                you thus given.</p>
            <p>I stayed until this morning with the Sanborns, &#38; found them endlessly kind. They
                were anxious to hear all about you. Sanborn himself may come to see you soon, when
                passing through Philadelphia. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03320.003.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> Yesterday morning he drove me round by Lincoln &#38; other
                pleasant rustic places. It was so fine that I wish you could have been with us. In
                the afternoon Dr. Emerson drove me to Walden Pond again; &#38; in the evening I met
                Channing<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> (who as you know is morbidly shy.) &#38; had a quiet talk at Sanborn's snug
                fireside, with its blazing logs to make good cheer.</p>
