                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>A postal card from Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> yesterday tells me that you will
                write the preface for me to the volume of William's<ptr target="n2002"/> stories. I
                can't tell you how glad I am! It is of all things just what I would wish.</p>

            <p>The stories were all but "The Carpenter" written before you knew him, when <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03001.004.jpg" type="verso"/>he was very young, but
                some of them show great maturity in spiritual insight. "The Ghost" is my favorite,
                &amp; I have read it dozens of times,&#8212;&amp; some parts of it even yet I never
                can read without tears,&#8212;it is a noble &amp; sweet lesson. They are mostly<pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03001.005.jpg" type="recto"/> Christmas stories.
                "The Brazen Android" has never been in type, save a part of it which the publishers
                had put into the printer's hands when William recalled it, &amp; sent back the money
                they had sent him, on it.<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03001.006.jpg" type="verso"
                /> I tell you all this, as you may not remember. His friends have been urging me to
                collect &amp; have the stories made into a volume, with a sketch, or a little
                biography, or something,&#8212;but I have been unable to see how or what to do,<pb
                    xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03001.007.jpg" type="recto"/> till the idea to have
                you write this for me came like an inspiration! I saw at once that it was just the
                thing, &amp; would give the book just what it needs. Your name &amp; William's will
                be <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="9"/> in many ways, &amp; this
                loving word from you will be a comfort to me for all time. Any facts<pb
                    xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.03001.008.jpg" type="verso"/> or any thing that you
                may want, ask for, I shall only be too happy to give.</p>



            <p>The book will have a sale, I know, if you write the preface.</p>
            <p>You will think &amp; <hi rend="underline">brood</hi> over<pb xml:id="leaf005r"
                    facs="loc.03001.009.jpg" type="recto"/> it, &amp; the right thought will come I
                am sure. The stories with the new one, will be seven in number.</p>
            <p>I hope you are feeling well this perfect June 1<hi rend="underline">st</hi> day.</p>
