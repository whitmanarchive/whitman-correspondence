                    To Walt Whitman.

            <p>
                I read of your age and sickness and your belief that you are not much accepted by your generation; but also of the
               comfort which personal letters of appreciation and thanks have been to you. So I will put by every reason that has hitherto
               hindered me from sending a frank message of love and thanks to you, in the though that my message can do no harm, and if 
               it is a small drop of comfort, it may add to others, and so amount to something.

                I blush to read that the tenderest and gratefulest breath of thy heart has gone over the sea-gales to England.
                I mean I am glad for them to have had ever so tender a breath of thy heart, but I am very sad to think we compatriots should

                I know a day will come soon when the "big American magazines" will vie to reprint and make head pieces of Walt Whitman's verse. 
                And this is why I know. I was nourished and formed by everything most American, for I am (so to speak) one of the children 
                of the war. That overwhelming outburst of spirit was the first thing to stamp my nature. My first coherent memory is of the Brooklyn
                14th Regiment recruiting on Fort Green in 1861. (I then very proud of a dear Uncle&#8212;Commissary of the Regt., who afterward, 
                down at the "front," had once the honor to entertain Walt Whitman in his tent.) And as sure as it was the very spirit of democracy 
                that was mother's milk to me, so sure am I that <hi rend="underline">therefore</hi> I love Walt Whitman&#8212;and as whatever is 
                most American and democratic must in time lead the rest here&#8212;and be served by the big magazines as well as the little, 
                <hi rend="underline">therefore</hi> I know Walt Whitman's great heart will still wake the
