                <salute>Dear Walt;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Last night was my first real attempt at the kind of splurge we have talked about.
                Bust &#38; photo exhibition; clay modeling and talk. I came off at the Presbyterian
                Ch. before the <hi rend="underline">Tuesday</hi> Club&#8212;I have met nowhere a
                more intelligent company. There were some 200 present. I began by a ten minute
                reading as a sort of <hi rend="underline">"prayer"</hi> or <hi rend="underline"
                    >prelude,</hi> &#38; then turned to my clay &#38; modeled &#38; talked for a
                half or three quarters of an hour, producing a tolerably good head of old John
                    Brown.<ptr target="n3169"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03181.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I was able to
                keep up a continuous interest. Then I explained casting in plaster, &#38; the
                reproduction in marble. Then I drew some chalk pictures on blackboard, &#38; gave
                some reminiscinces of Emerson,<ptr target="n1044"/> yourself &#38; Dr. Holmes.<ptr
                    target="n3024"/> I had your photos there&#8212;&#38; many others, with my busts
                of Hicks,<ptr target="n0301"/> Sumner,<ptr target="n0606"/> Emerson, &#38; my little
                head of mother&#8212;We kept up the business till near ten o'clock. I guess it was a
                    <hi rend="underline">success.</hi> At all events, the <hi rend="underline"
                    >thanks</hi> were profuse and hearty. Several ministers were there &#38; in
                perfectly <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03181.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> good
                humor. I now feel sure I can make this sort of thing <hi rend="underline">all</hi>
                over the country. But I want to reduce the bust exhibition business to a magic
                lantern performance. It will not be so picturesque, but more convenient, &#38; much
                less expensive. It would cost like sin to tote several large busts about the
                country. I wish I had photos of my big busts of you &#38; of the statuette,
                negatives small size fit for stereopticon. I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> have
                them some way. Next Sunday's Register will print my opening remarks &#38; give a
                account of the evening <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03181.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> I shall send you a copy.</p>
            <p>I am worried about Harned.<ptr target="loc.03745_n1"/> Horace<ptr target="n3041"/>
                just wrote me a word &#38; sent the <hi rend="underline">Posts</hi> two weeks ago,
                &#38; that's all I've heard. I hope the affair has not been serious.</p>
            <p>And I hope you are comfortable. I should like to stop in &#38; see you all. I'm
                trying to get the Hicks bust plastered before sending. Will send it by 1st of next
                week. I rather wanted to make the most of it here, &#38; so have delayed. What about
                the lecture for the <hi rend="underline">Fidelity</hi>?</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Kind regards to Mrs. D.<ptr target="n6113"/> Let her read this
                    &#38;</salute>
