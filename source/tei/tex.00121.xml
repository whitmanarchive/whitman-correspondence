         <p>I<ptr target="tex.00121_n100"/> am seated in an easy chair pen in hand trying to scribble a few lines to you. I expect it will take me all day to write this for I cant sit up but a few moments at a time. I was taken down with chills &amp; fever when I got to Pittsburg. I stayed there from Saturday night until Monday morning before any train left I dont think I ever was so sick in my life as I was in Pittsburg I about gave up there that I never should get home alive, but there was a Dr there he gave me some medison he said that would take me home &amp; it did.</p>
            <p>We was behind time at most every place we changed cars so we had to wait I expected to have got home in three days at the outside but instead of three I was six.</p>
            <p>It dont look much like winter here there is not a parrticle of snow on the ground &amp; its about such weather as it was in Washington although its not quite so muddy There hasnt been any sleighing here this winter &amp; there wont be now its to late in the season</p>
            <p>They are making maple sugar in this part of the world now when I get well I will eat some for you but I suppose you think that wont do you much good.</p>
            <p>I tell you I am glad I am out of that Hospital &amp; when I get into another to stay I will let you know it.</p>
            <p>Oh how are you getting along with your office I am in hopes you have recd it before this time I begun to think that your office &amp; my discharge had gone to the same place now I have got my papers I think you had ought to receive yours</p>
            <p>I cant write any more this time my hand trembles so I can hardly write but I will try &amp; do better next time give my best respects to Mr &amp; Mrs O Connor.<ptr target="tex.00121_n2"/> Yours &amp;c.</p>
