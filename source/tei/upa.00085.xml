            <p><hi rend="underline">The book</hi> came two days ago, &amp; I have been looking over
                all of it, &amp; reading a great part minutely—Surely it has been done well,
                &amp; is a beautiful &amp; (in one sense) sufficient memorial of the noblest mother
                &amp; woman. It appeals to my printer-sense too—is a handsome &amp; generous
                piece of typography &amp; mechanical book making, with its excellent paper &amp;
                press work—Thank you indeed dear H. for sending me an early copy<ptr target="upa.00085_n1"/>—George and Susan Stafford<ptr target="n0852d"/> are
                still at Glendale—Debby and Jo<ptr target="upa.00085_n4"/> have gone to
                Kansas—I was there last Sunday afternoon—they are well as
                usual—Harry has had a surgical operation on his throat. He now comes up from
                Marlton, (or Glendale) every day, to have the doctor watch &amp; dress it—is a
                little reduced in flesh &amp; blood, but is getting along well—Ed and Van and George are
                    well—Mont<ptr target="upa.00085_n5"/> is married<ptr target="upa.00085_n2"/>—(I went down Sunday to G to take him Harry home, at his request)—I am
                still here in my shanty in Mickle street—probably <hi rend="underline">let
                    down a peg or two</hi> from when I saw you last, but not much
                different—mentally the same—physically a sad wreck—I am reciting my
                "Death of Abraham Lincoln" lecture<ptr target="med.00796_n2"/> when I get a call—(as this is the
                season)—go on to New York for that purpose April 14, if I can get
                there—had a good visit from Chas Rowley<ptr target="upa.00085_n3"/> of
                Manchester yesterday—I am well as usual—Love to you—Spring is
                tardy here—My canary is singing blithely as I write—</p>
