            <p>Mr. Cyril Flower wrote to me some time ago to inform me that he had brought your
                books with him from America, a gift from you, and that they were lying in my London
                chambers; Whereupon I wrote back to him, begging him to bring them himself to me at
                my country house, and I have been accordingly, always expecting to see him, but he
                never came, being detained by law business in town. I have now just called at my
                London lodgings, and found them on the table. I had previously met with several of
                your works and read them with interest and had made up my mind that you had a large
                and lovable nature. I discovered great "go" in your writings and am not surprised at
                the hold they have taken on your fellow country men.<ptr target="med.00410_n2"/></p>

            <p>Wishing you all success and prosperity, and with all thanks for your kind gift which I should have acknowledged earlier, had I received it sooner, I remain</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Ever yours, very truly,</salute>

            <postscript>
                <p>I trust that if you visit England, you will grant me the pleasure of receiving
                    and entertaining you under my own roof.</p>
