My Dear Sir:</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I stood beneath the broad dome of the crystal palace.&#8212;within a nave viewing a piece of marble statuary: my soul seemed to breathe, did breathe into that form the breath of life: the broad chest heaved with passionate creation! those limbs were no longer pulseless and the eye returned my admiring gaze.&#8212;I reached out my hand to feel the life-blood thrill beneath my fingers&#8212;I was faint with transport. How divine! how wonderful!</p>  
            <p>But I was wakened from my trance by a hiss of dirision:&#8212;a jostle from the crowd, and a whispered caution&#8212;"Come away darling"!&#8212;My eyes were opened:&#8212;before me stood a nude figure! I should not have seen it but for the vulgar crowd</p>
            <p>I had heard of your poem and a remembrance from the stationer made me desirous of having in my possession&#8212;all alone!</p>
            <p>It lay upon my lap. I opened it with dainty fingers.&#8212;Starting at the faintest sound fearing intrusion!&#8212;But as I drank nectar from the fount of inspiration, a myriad spectre forms might jostle, hiss and frown&#8212;I understood the Poet!&#8212;I too had felt my heart beat against the broad bosom of the earth, and kissed the dewy tears from her face.&#8212;talked with the stars, and dallied with the ocean;&#8212;embraced the rough old scragly oak, and in return hear an anthem wail from his hoar branches:&#8212;had lain upon a mossy bed within the quiet, dusky dingle;&#8212;through my arms above my head to catch the stray sunbeams;&#8212;hugged it to my bosom transported with extatic emotion;&#8212;yet never came before my vision sensual forms or thought found place in my imagination;&#8212;Was I passionless?&#8212;Did I not love the sun and stars, the birds and flowers, rocks and trees and man, the laborer, broad chested, sun burnt, vigorous man! and woman&#8212;my sister&#8212;gentle, lovely woman.</p>
            <p>Have I not blessed the tears.&#8212;the warm, sympathetic tears that crept from beneath my eyelids and rolled lovingly down my bosom, soothing my beating heart?</p>
            <p>Have I not sought the vaulted chamber, canopying the earth, and gazed upon the myriad worlds listening to their murmuring voices&#8212;felt the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#tg" cert="low">caution</unclear> of the night, felt in <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#kk">draperied</unclear> fold about me&#8212;Oh, every thing was holy!</p>
            <p>Why did you not drape your poems with a fig leaf brother Walt?&#8212;Not for me&#8212;it would have roused me from my dream of bliss. I had heard again the <gap reason="illegible"/> cantiere <gap reason="illegible"/> every darling; the crowd sneer at you;......</p>
            <p>I have read your poem and pronounce it "good" as you merge from behind the screen and stand boldly forward&#8212;I give you my hand, and return your kindly greeting.&#8212;God bless you for the "Leaves of Grass" which you have gleaned from the meadow; on the highway;&#8212;by the seashore on the camp ground, wet with the dews of heaven and "tears of angels"&#8212;</p>
