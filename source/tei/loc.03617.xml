                </choice> not have the least objection. It must be remembered however that the
                Criticism relates to a Swinburne of the past, rather considerably different from the

                dare say it is not worse than my other writings. </p>
            <p>Swinburne lives now a rather isolated life, away from my part of London. I very

                am sure he is no longer <hi rend="underline">enthusiastic</hi> about Whitman, &#38;
                I doubt whether he even <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03617.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> likes his writings at all. My own feelings on the subject remain
                unchanged, &#38; I was much pleased at the reissue of my selection&#8212;a much
                handsomer volume than the original one. </p>
            <p>That Birth-song by Swinburne relates to my eldest daughter: I forget whether there is
                any allusion in it directly connecting it with my dedication to Blake; but at any
                rate the young lady came into the world in due course after the <unclear

                myself had become wife &#38; husband. I am happy to say that both my wife &#38; my
                daughter are alive. My wife however has for 1&#190; year been an invalid from
                bronchial attacks, &#38; it is only <pb xml:id="leaf002v"

                along with that daughter, &#38; my son, off by train to the Riviera San Reno, or
                perhaps Mentone&#8212; where they will remain I dare say till at any rate the end of
                March.</p>
