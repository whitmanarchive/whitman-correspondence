                <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter reached me this afternoon. I am very glad indeed you are coming home<ptr target="nyp.00279_n2"/>—I already make
                calculations not only of resuming our old talks &amp; good times, but of the much
                news you will have to tell—also of seeing little Jenny again—dear
                child, be sure she is not left out of account—Is Mrs. Channing<ptr target="nyp.00279_n3"/> with you then? I send my friendliest remembrances
                &amp; good wishes. And to my ever dear friends, Mrs. Price &amp; family—you
                know how much I think of them, &amp; estimate them always, with love &amp;
                thanks—</p>

            <p>It is between two &amp; three o'clock p. m.—We have had a snowy day—as I
                look out of my window the ground is white in every direction—William<ptr target="nyp.00279_n4"/> has a bad cold, has not been down to work to-day, but has
                just come down town, &amp; is this moment sitting by my desk, reading the extra
                Evening <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>—the fight between Congress &amp; the
                President, about Secretary of War,<ptr target="nyp.00279_n5"/> rages furiously—The House will doubtless order <hi rend="italic">impeachment</hi>—&amp; we are going to have exciting times
                generally—but I guess no appeal to arms—</p>

            <p>I have heard lately from my dear mother—she is well as usual—Emma Price
                can tell you more directly about her, as I hear, (to my great pleasure) that she has
                called on mother once or twice lately.<ptr target="nyp.00279_n6"/> I am well as usual—have not yet
                rec'd a copy of my English re-print<ptr target="nyp.00279_n7"/>—but hear that
                one is on the way—Mr. Swinburne, the poet, has sent me a handsome copy of his
                    <hi rend="italic">William Blake</hi><ptr target="nyp.00279_n8"/> containing certain mention of me, which I will show you when you come.
                    Hotten,<ptr target="nyp.00279_n9"/> the London publisher, has written
                me, very handsomely, offering a fee, on every copy—Rossetti, the editor, has
                also written me several letters, very satisfactory—I think you will like your
                apartments, after you get used to them—it is a fresh, sweet, new house<ptr target="nyp.00279_n10"/>—that's a good deal—</p>

            <p>And now, dear friend, God bless you &amp; little one, &amp; a safe &amp; speedy
                return to friends &amp; home. </p>
