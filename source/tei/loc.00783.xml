               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was mighty glad to get George's letter, I can tell you&#8212;you have not heard since, I suppose&#8212;they must be now back again in Kentucky, or that way, as I see a letter from Cairo, (up the Mississippi river,) that boats had stopt there with the 9th Corps on, from Vicksburgh, going up toward Cincinnati&#8212;I think the letter was dated Aug 10. I have no doubt they are back again up that way somewhere.<ptr target="loc.00783_n1"/> I wrote to George, four or five days ago, I directed it Ohio, Mississippi or elsewhere&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I was very glad indeed to get your letter&#8212;I am so sorry Andrew does not get any better, it is very distressing&#8212;about losing the voice, he must not be so much alarmed, as that continues sometimes years, &amp; the health otherwise good<ptr target="loc.00783_n2"/>&#8212;Mother, you must have had a very unhappy day Heyde's first letter came, writing all such stuff as I guess no man living but he can tack together&#8212;I know how you must have felt, with your other annoyances, &amp; every thing, mother. I do hope you will try not to let things cast you down, for they pass over somehow, &amp; it hurts one so in old age to be taken down even for a day&#8212;Heyde is bound to make as much unhappiness as he can&#8212;(he is worse than bed bugs.)</p>
            <p>Mother, I wrote to Han about five days ago, told her we had heard from George, &amp; all the news&#8212;I must write to Mary too, without fail&#8212;I should like to hear from them all, &amp; from Fanny&#8212;There has been a young man here in hospital, from Farmingdale, he was wounded, his name is Hendrickson, he has gone home on a furlough, he knows the Van Nostrands very well, I told him to go &amp; see Aunt Fanny.<ptr target="loc.00783_n3"/> I was glad you gave Emma Price my direction here, I should like to hear from Mrs Price<ptr target="loc.00783_n4"/> &amp; her girls first rate, I think a great deal about them, &amp;, mother, I wish you to tell any of them so, they always used me first rate, &amp; always stuck up for me&#8212;if I knew their street &amp; number I should write&#8212;</p>
            <p>It has been awful hot here, now for twenty one days&#8212;ain't that a spell of weather?&#8212;the first two weeks I got along better than I would have thought, but the last week I have felt it more, have felt it in my head a little&#8212;I no more stir without my umbrella, in the day time, than I would without my boots. I am afraid of the sun affecting my head, &amp; move pretty cautious&#8212;Mother, I think every day, I wonder if this hot weather is affecting mother much, I suppose it must a good deal, but I hope it cannot last much longer&#8212;mother, I had a letter in the N Y Times of last Sunday<ptr target="loc.00783_n5"/>&#8212;did you see it?</p>
            <p>I wonder if George can't get a furlough &amp; come home for a while, that furlough he had was only a flea bite&#8212;if he could it would be no more than right, for no man in the country has done his duty more faithful, &amp; without complaining of any thing or asking for any thing, than George&#8212;I suppose they will fill up the 51st with conscripts, as that seems the order of the day&#8212;a good many are arriving here, from the north, &amp; passing through to join Meade's army&#8212;we are expecting to hear of more rows in New York, about the draft&#8212;it commences there right away I see&#8212;this time it will be no such doings as a month or five weeks ago, the gov't here is forwarding a large force of regulars to New York to be ready for any thing that may happen&#8212;there will be no blank cartridges this time&#8212;Well, I thought when I first heard of the riot in N Y<ptr target="loc.00783_n6"/> I had some feeling for them, but soon as I found what it really was, I felt it was the devil's own work all through&#8212;I guess the strong arm will be exhibited this time, up to the shoulder.</p>
            <p>Mother, I want to see you &amp; all very much&#8212;As I wish to be here at the opening of Congress, &amp; during the winter, I have an idea I will try to come home for a month, but I don't know when&#8212;I want to see the young ones &amp; Mat &amp; Jeff &amp; every body&#8212;Well, mother, I should like to know all the domestic affairs home, don't you have the usual things, eating &amp;c. Why, Mother, I should think you would eat nearly all your meals with Mat&#8212;I know you must when they have any thing good, (&amp; I know Mat will have good things if she has got a cent left)&#8212;Mother, don't you miss <hi rend="italic">Walt</hi>&#8212;loafing around, &amp; carting himself off to New York, toward the latter part of every afternoon?&#8212;how do you &amp; the Browns get along?&#8212;that hell-hole over the way, what a nuisance it must be nights&#8212;here it is very quiet nights, &amp; I generally have a very good sleep&#8212;mother, I suppose you sleep in the back room yet&#8212;I suppose the new houses next door are occupied&#8212;how I should like to take a walk on old Fort Greene, tell Mannahatta her uncle Walt will be home yet, from the sick soldiers, &amp; have a good walk all around, if she behaves good to her grandmother &amp; don't cut up&#8212;Mother, I am scribbling this hastily in Major Hapgood's office, it is not so hot today, quite endurable. I send you my love, dear mother, &amp; to all, &amp; wish Jeff &amp; you to write as often as you can&#8212;</p>
