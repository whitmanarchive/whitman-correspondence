                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have yours of the 13th, and am rejoiced. Today is the 15th&#8212;the day the book
                is to appear.</p>

            <p>I am getting better, and hope soon to be myself again&#8212;A bandaged hand prevents
                my writing, and everything is in arrears with me.</p>

            <p>W.S.K's notice is <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr_kc.00093.jpg" type="verso"/> very
                gratifying. As soon as I get the free use of my hand, I will write to him, as you
                suggest. I read some time ago his article on you in the San Francisco magazine.</p>

            <p>Nothing will ever please me like knowing that my Bucke letter stands as it does with
                you. This is the king's signet. Your compare of it to '93 is magnificent <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr_kc.00094.jpg" type="recto"/> and happy. Yet
                the retribution is only partial. As Willie Winter says, there is "a Himalayan stack"
                left&#8212;little he knows how Himalayan. Little beast!</p>

            <p>The more I think of the recent Tribune review, the more I am amused. It betrays the
                writer's sense of having been spanked, so thoroughly. There is a kind of surprised
                meekness in the tone of it. His plea that I ought to hear <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="syr_kc.00095.jpg" type="verso"/> with patience his "frankness" is
                particularly good. It reminds me of a story Henry Peterson told me. At school a boy
                came up, and said, "Say, Peterson, do you like frankness?" "Yes," replied Henry,
                "I do." "Well, then," rejoined the other, "I think your sister is the ugliest girl I
                ever saw in my life." This seems to be the Tribune idea of "frankness" also!</p>
