            <p>Well I am still home &amp; no event of importance to write you about. My illness has passed over, &amp; I go around the same as formerly, only a lingering suspicion of weakness now &amp; then&#8212;I go out fishing &amp; have been out riding frequently&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is a hospital<ptr target="nyp.00192_n3"/> here, containing a couple of hundred soldiers, it is only a quarter of a mile from our house, &amp; I go there a good deal&#8212;am going this afternoon to spend the afternoon &amp; evening&#8212;Strange as it may seem days &amp; days elapse without their having any visitors&#8212;So you see I am still in business&#8212;Some of the cases are very interesting&#8212;</p>
            <p>My mother is very well, &amp; the rest the same&#8212;We have heard from my brother up to the beginning of this month, he is well<ptr target="nyp.00192_n4"/>&#8212;We felt pretty gloomy some little time since, as two young men of the 51st N Y, friends of my brother George &amp; of our family (officers of 51st), were killed in battle within ten days of each other &amp; their bodies brought on for burial here<ptr target="nyp.00192_n5"/>&#8212;Mother was at the funeral of each of them, &amp; I also&#8212;the regiment is on the Weldon road &amp; in a position of danger&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have seen Mrs Price, she speaks of you &amp; hopes to know you, she is only tolerably well&#8212;I have not seen Charles Howells<ptr target="nyp.00192_n6"/> for some time&#8212;I shall write to William to-day&#8212;I rec'd a letter from Charles Eldridge yesterday, he was to pass through New York yesterday on his way to Boston for two or three weeks&#8212;"Drum Taps" is not yet begun to be printed&#8212;Nelly, I was much obliged for the photograph&#8212;it reminds me of you &amp; is good&#8212;how is dear little Jennie?&#8212;&amp; you, my dear dear friend, how are you in health &amp; spirits, &amp; have you had a good time&#8212;O how I should like to see you all again&#8212;</p>
