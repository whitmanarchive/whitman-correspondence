            </opener>
            <p>For so you seem to me just like a grandfather whom I once knew years ago, but who
                lives in my memory as a childish recollection. No, I have never seen you with my
                physical eyes, but I feel as though I had, and it is my love for your work, and
                through that for yourself that prompts me to write you and declare it. I long thought
                of stretching out my hands across the water in greeting to you, but that diffidence
                I had lest I might be intruding unwarrantably upon your quiet has hitherto prevented
                me. This has now passed away through the kindness of a new-found friend&#8212;D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> of Bolton&#8212;who tells me he has sent you a
                copy of "Great Thoughts"<ptr target="loc.03263_n2"/> containing my small addition to the literature appreciative of your
                prophetic messages and high-souled<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03263.002.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> songs. May this be my excuse for thrusting my small
                personality into the path of your Kingly one.</p>
            <p>It is now about five years ago, (when I was 21, and looked something like the
                photograph I enclose) since I first remember reading any of your poems, and that
                was in a small anthology. From that time I wished to read more of them, and, making
                discoveries for myself, I at last found "Leaves of Grass"&#8212;one of the late
                editions&#8212;and rejoiced as over a discovery of hid treasure. Needless to tell
                you, I read it through, and lost no time in buying "Specimen Days."<ptr target="n4121"/></p>
            <p>It does not need an Indian to find my trail through the "Leaves of Grass." It is
                broad and thick. Thumb marks, ink scratches, pencil notes, and dear old
                stains&#8212;each one has its history, and is looked upon as an old friend. Even my
                Bible is not so bemarked.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03263.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Your volume holds a princely place in my ranks of 600; for to it I owe so much of
                what is now mine, and a never-ceasing interest in all that appertains to life. My
                eyes have been opened to a truer view of the Bible, of Shakespeare&#8212;yea, of all
                the great minds that have enriched mankind. And for all this&#8212;this that makes
                life so truly happy I thank <hi rend="underline">you</hi>.</p>
            <p>I need hardly say how gratified I should be if it pleased you to write to me, if only
                a line.</p>
            <p>We may never meet on this earth, and I would like to be as near to you as possible in
                the next way&#8212;by a personal letter&#8212;In the after-days we shall surely
                meet&#8212;somehow, somewhere; and then we shall see, and know, and understand.</p>
            <p>To you&#8212;of all of the best that ever God has divined here and
                hereafter&#8212;love, honour, glory and<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03263.004.jpg" type="verso"/> power.</p>
            <p>Good bye my master and my friend!</p>
            <p>Think that I grasp your hand as long as all may or even so little longer.</p>
            <p>Goodbye, and again my thanks&#8212;as yours, "a soldier's traveller's thanks."<ptr target="loc.03263_n3"/></p>
