            <p>Your post card of 28 April<ptr target="loc.05960_n1"/> was sent down to me here<ptr
                    target="loc.05960_n2"/> yesterday. I have had O'Connor's little book<ptr
                    target="loc.05960_n3"/> and read it. Have been in England now nearly two weeks
                and am having a pleasant time seeing all my old friends &#38;c. I saw Mrs Costelloe
                a couple of times and took her last friday to the Grand Theatre, Islington, in
                London to see Shelley's Cenci acted. The play was put on the boards by the Shelley
                Society and acted "privately" not advertised, but the theatre (a very large one) was
                crowded. Vezin acted old cenci &#38; Alma Murray Beatrice and these two part were
                about the best acting I have ever seen. When I return to London (early next week I
                think) I am to stay a few days with Mrs Costelloe and shall write you again from
                there. We had a long passage (16 days) I enjoyed the sea very much &#38; was almost
                sorry to get to England, the voyage did me good too. I was over a week in London
                before I came down here and was pretty busy while there. After my visit to Mrs
                Costelloe I go to Scotland. The weather was good all across the ocean and very fine
                the week I was in London but since I have never been here it has been cloudy cold
                and wet&#8212;but it does not much matter</p>
            <p>I am enjoying myself and getting a good rest which I needed after the bustle of
                London. Goodly, remember me to Mrs Davis, I expect you will be living in great style
                when I get back you are so rich now!<ptr target="loc.05960_n4"/></p>
