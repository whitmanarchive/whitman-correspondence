            <p>A bright sky, but a very cold day&#8212;ice remains firm on the shade side of the
                street. I have been striving to raise enough to buy &#189; tin of coal&#8212;quite
                exhausted&#8212;more so than at any time this season.</p>

            <p>Han<ptr target="n0285"/> is despondent, weak, very nervous; you must expect her to reply, even by postal
                to your kind notes&#8212;</p>

            <p>The paper you <choice><sic>maild</sic><corr>mailed</corr></choice> to her was very encouraging, and she craves for a couple of rooms
                near you&#8212;that she might furnish, and enjoy with you the bright Camden
                sunshine&#8212;</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="duk.00446.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I am quite broken down at times; irritable from this epidemic&#8212;I make two coal
                fires and have the sitting room and <choice>
                    <sic>kichen</sic>
                    <corr>kitchen</corr>
                </choice> well warmed, when she comes down, but a man is not precisely the kind of
                servant a woman needs. Mrs. Church<ptr target="n5000"/> is very clever but she has a house full of
                boarders. She is very thorough and competent.</p>

            <p>I am puzzled at times how to continue&#8212;I sleep well&#8212;yet I need rest other
                ways. I feel at times that I shall be compelled to give up&#8212;I have something
                like the <choice>
