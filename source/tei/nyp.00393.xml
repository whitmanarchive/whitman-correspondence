            </opener> 

            <p>Early in the year 1863&#8212;I think in the final month&#8212;I lay on a cot in Mother Whippy's Ward 
                at Judiciary <choice><abbr>Sqre</abbr><expan>Square</expan></choice> <choice><abbr>Hospt.</abbr><expan>Hospital</expan></choice> 
                in Washington D.C. sick "Nigh unto death" when there came in one day, with charitable intent, a stalwart 
                man of genial appearance &amp; seemingly past the middle age since his hair &amp; face beard were 
                plentifully sprinkled with white. This man (whose frame, as I afterward found, was no mean type of 
                the generous heart within) came to my bed, sat down, &amp; after some talk with me wrote a letter 
                to my parents in Michigan. This act secured my gratitude &amp; we became intimately acquainted &amp; 
                close friends&#8212;Being furloughed in July '63 &amp; discharged while in 
                <choice><abbr>Mich.</abbr><expan>Michigan</expan></choice> I lost sight of my friend &amp; I am not 
                sure that I even heard of him until I returned in '64 with an ugly bullet hole through my left lung 
                that time finding a lodgment at Armory <choice><abbr>Sqr.</abbr><expan>Square</expan></choice> 
                <choice><abbr>Hospt</abbr><expan>Hospital</expan></choice>.<ptr target="n0043"/></p>
            <p>My friend was still in Washington, we met, &amp; our intimacy was renewed and again abruptly broken 
                off in the summer of '65 when I was transferred to New Haven &amp; soon afterward discharged from the 
                service. Although I have never since heard a word from my quondam friend, still the name Walt Whitman 
                is a household one in our family &amp; the picture (by Schaff)<ptr target="nyp.00393_n2"/> with the 
                autograph, Walt Whitman 1863 written in pencil in the margin to the right is lying here on the table 
                having been brought down stairs a little while ago to be compared with one which appears in Leslie's<ptr target="n0246"/> 
                for April 8th<ptr target="nyp.00393_n4"/> &amp; which I brought up Friday with the Sunday N.Y. papers.</p>
            <p>The question that naturally comes to us now is this, Is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Walt Whitman,&#8212;"the 
                Poet of health &amp; strength," <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Walt Whitman of old? Everybody who has seen 
                the two pictures says they are of the same man&#8212;If it indeed be true, I am very glad for I shall, 
                I know, hear from my old friend&#8212;I am married, live here, (my mother living with us) &amp; have 
                charge of one of the public schools (No. 13) of the city.</p>
            <p>I shall take a lively interest in the arrival of the postman for some time hereafter in the hope that I 
                am what the rest so confidently assert:</p>
