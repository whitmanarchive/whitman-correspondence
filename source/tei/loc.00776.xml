            <p>I suppose you rec'd a letter from me last Wednesday as I sent you one Tuesday, (7th)&#8212;dear mother, I was glad enough to hear from George, by that letter from Snyder's Bluffs, June 28th&#8212;I had felt a little fear on acc't of some of those storming parties Grant sent against Vicksburgh the middle of June &amp; up to the 20th&#8212;but this letter dispels all anxiety&#8212;I have written to George many times, but it seems he has not got them&#8212;Mother, I shall write immediately to him again&#8212;I think he will get the letter I sent last Sunday, as I directed it to Vicksburgh&#8212;I told him all the news from home. Mother, I shall write to Han &amp; inclose George's letter&#8212;I am real glad to hear from Mat &amp; the little one, all so favorable&#8212;We are having pleasant weather here still&#8212;I go to Campbell Hospital this afternoon&#8212;I still keep going, mother&#8212;the wounded are doing rather badly I am sorry to say, there are frequent deaths. The weather, I suppose, which has been peculiarly bad for wounds, so wet &amp; warm, (though not disagreeable outdoors)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, you must write as often as you can, &amp; Jeff too&#8212;you must not get worried about the ups &amp; downs of the war&#8212;I don't know any course but to resign onesself to events&#8212;if one can only bring one's mind to it&#8212;Good bye once more for the present, dearest mother, Mat &amp; the dear little ones.</p>
