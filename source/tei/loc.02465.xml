                <salute>My Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your kind p.c. of Feb 26<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02465_n2"/> to
                hand &#38; my best thanks to you for it!</p>
            <p>I note that you were then "about the same," &#38; though we cannot but feel
                disappointed at the news &#38; wish it were better still we are thankful that under
                the circumstances it is no worse</p>
            <p>This prolonged "bad spell" must have told upon your strength &#38; <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02465.002.jpg" type="verso"/> exhausted you very considerably; &#38;
                yet, despite the physical exhaustion &#38; the severe bodily pain which we know you
                are almost constantly suffering, and which in an ordinary person would be regaded as
                a sufficient reason for not replying to any letters, <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                write to us by nearly every mail!</p>
            <p>For this continued thoughtfulness &#38; marvellous loving-kindness we thank you from
                the bottom of our hearts, beloved Master generous Benefactor and kind hearted
                Friend.</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02465.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>God bless you &#38; grant that you may ere long have relief from the wearying pain
                &#38; distress that have been yours for so long!</p>
            <p>As the attendance at the last meeting of "the College"<ptr target="loc.02440_n6"/> was limited to
                three&#8212;R.K. Greenhalgh,<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> Wentworth Dixon,<ptr
                    target="loc.02465_n4"/> &#38; myself&#8212;we had a select little "Whitman
                Evening" all to ourselves. After reading over our Whitman correspondence of the past
                week R.K.G. read a long &#38; most interesting letter from "dear J.W.W."<ptr
                    target="n6121"/> as you call him&#8212;he <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a dear
                fellow&#8212;to a friend of his, Mr Goldstraw.<ptr target="n5001"/> It was in reply
                to some of <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02465.004.jpg" type="verso"/> G's
                objections on his first attempt to read L. of G. &#38; proved to be a really
                splendid letter entirely worthy of J.W.W. We have kept a copy of it. Then R.K.G.
                read "The Song of the Universal," W.D. read "The Song of Prudence," &#38; I read "To
                Think of Time"&#8212;&#38; a very good time we had.</p>
            <p>In this month's <hi rend="underline">National Review</hi><ptr target="loc.07905_n5"/> I came across a quotation
                from Stedman<ptr target="n1043"/> and Kay'<ptr target="loc.04589_n2"/> "Library
                of American Literature" to the effect that "American Literature began with Walt
                Whitman and has yet got no further."</p> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02465.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>This morning I had the pleasure of reading another beautiful letter from J.A.
                    Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> to J.W.W. In it he gives many interesting details
                of personal history &#38; we purpose sending you a copy of it. He also pays J.W.W a
                high compliment upon his caligraphic skill by asking "if Dr. Johnston keeps a
                forger!" because the facsimiles of some of your post cards&#8212;the work of
                J.W.W.&#8212;which we sent to him were almost as like the originals as if they had
                been photographed.</p>
            <p>During the past few days the Midlands &#38; South West of England have been visited
                by a very severe storm <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02465.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with an exceptionally heavy snow fall &#38; we read of railway trains being buried
                in snowdrifts, a lifeboat capsized, shipwrecks, people being frozen to death but
                with the exception of frequent snowshowers we in the North have seen nothing of the
                "blizzard"</p>
            <p>This is a truly glorious day here&#8212;an easterly wind with bright sunshine, a
                beautiful blue sky with great snow-white masses of cumulus clouds like sunlit
                mountains of the purest cotton wool, sailing majestically across it&#8212;a day to
                make the heaviest <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02465.007.jpg" type="recto"/>
                heart buoyant, the saddest rejoice, &#38; all the sons of men unite in one grand
                paean of thanksgiving to the All Good. If I only knew <hi rend="underline">for
                    certain</hi> that you were better I should be ever so much more at ease. However
                I must hope for the best, &#38; we know that <hi rend="underline">whatever</hi>
                happens <hi rend="underline">is</hi> for the best.</p>
            <p>When next you see H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> please convey to him my cordial regards;
                &#38; with a heartful of love &#38; good wishes <pb xml:id="leaf005v"
