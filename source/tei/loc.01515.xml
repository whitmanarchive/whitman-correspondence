                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>According to announcement in my last,<ptr target="loc.01515_n2"/> I have made a
                movement &#38; change of base from tumultuous close=packed world-like N.Y. to the
                <hi rend="underline">handsome</hi>, half=rural, brisk, handsome New England,
                third class town. I came on here last Thursday. I came as guest of Thomas Davis,<ptr
                    target="n0187"/> formerly M.C. from this city&#8212;arrived between 8 and 9
                o'clock at night&#8212;found his carriage at the depot wait'g for me&#8212;at the
                house&#8212;a sort of castle built of stone, on fine grounds a mile &#38; a half
                from the town&#8212;a hearty welcome from his hospitable wife, &#38; a family of
                young ladies &#38; children&#8212;a hot supper, a tip-top room &#38;c. &#38;c. &#42;
                So you see Pete, your old man is in clover. I have since been round the city &#38;
                suburbs <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aa" cert="high">considerably</unclear>. I
                am going down to Newport before I <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.01515.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>return. &#42; Invitations &#38;c.
                are numerous. I am in fact already dividing myself between two hospitalities, part
                of the time with Mr &#38; Mrs. Davis,<ptr target="duk.00617_n15"/> and part with Dr.
                &#38; Mrs. Channing,<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> old acquaintances of mine in
                another part of the city. I stopt last night at the house of the latter. It is on a
                high &#38; pleasant hill at the side of the city, which it entirely overlooks. From
                the window of my room, I can look down across the city, the river, and over off miles 
                upon miles in the distance. The woods are a real spectacle, colored with all the
                rich colors of autumn. Yesterday it was beautiful &#38; balmy beyond description,
                like the finest Indian summer. I wandered around, partly walking partly in a
                carriage a good part of the day. To-day there is an entire change of
                scenery&#8212;As I sit writ'g this, what do you think Pete?&#8212;great
                flakes&#8212;of <hi rend="underline">snow</hi> are fall'g, <hi rend="underline"
                    >sometimes</hi>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01515.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>&#8212;the wind
                blows gusts&#8212;quite a thick flurry&#8212;in fact a real snow=storm has been go'g
                on all the forenoon though without the look &#38; or feeling of winter, as the grass
                &#38; foliage are autumnal, &#38; the cold is not severe yet. Still it disagreeable,
                &#38; wet &#38; dark, &#38; prevents me from going out. So I will make it up by
                writing a couple of letters&#8212;one to mother, &#38; one to you <unclear
                    reason="illegible" resp="#aa" cert="medium">tell'g</unclear> you about things.
                Providence is a handsome city of about 70000 inhabitants&#8212;has numerous
                manufactories in full operation&#8212;every thing looks lively. From the house up
                here, I can hear almost any time, night or day, the sound of factory bells &#38; the
                steam whistles of locomotives half a mile distant. Then the lights at night seen
                from here make a curious exhibition. At both the places I stop, we have plenty of
                ripe, fresh fruit and lots of flowers. Pete I could now send you a bouquet every
                morn'g, far better than I used to, for much choicer flowers.<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01515.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/></p>
            <p>And how are you gett'g along, dearest comrade? I hope you are well, &#38; that every
                th'g is going on right with you. I have not heard from you for a good while it
                seems. I suppose you got my last letter, 14th from N.Y. I expect to return to N.Y.
                there about the 22d. Should you feel to write after receiving this, you might direct
                to 331 East 55th st. as before. I am well as usual. I am luxuriating on excellent
                grapes. I wish I could send you a basket. At both places I stop they have
                vineyeards, &#38; the grapes are very good &#38; plenty this year. Last night, when
                I went up at 11 o'clock to my room, I took up three great bunches, each as big as my
                fist, &#38; sat down and eat them before I turned in. I like to eat them this way,
                &#38; it agrees with me.</p>
            <p>It is quite a change here from my associations &#38; surroundings either in
                Washington or New York. Evenings, &#38; meal time I find myself thrown amidst a
                mild pleasant society, really intellectual composed largely of educated women, some
                young, some not so young, every thing refined &#38; polite, <hi rend="underline"
                    >not</hi> disposed to small talk, to convers'g in earnest, on profound subjects,
                but with a<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01515.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                moderate rather slow tone, &#38; in a kind &#38; conciliatory
                manner&#8212;delighting in this sort of conversation &#38; spending their evenings
                in it till late. I take a hand in, for a change. I find it entertaining, as I say ,
                for novelty's sake for a week or two&#8212;but I know very well that would be enough
                for me. It is all first rate good &#38; smart, but too constrained &#38; bookish for
                a free old hawk like me.</p>
            <p>I send you my love dear Pete. <hi rend="underline">So</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">long</hi>. Will write from N.Y. soon as I return there.</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>P.S. just after 12 oclock&#8212;noon&#8212;as I am just finish'g,&#8212;the storm
                    lightens up&#8212;I am sure I see a bit of blue sky in the clouds&#8212;yes the
                    sun is certainly break'g out.</p>
