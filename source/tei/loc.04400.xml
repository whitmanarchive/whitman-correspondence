                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Here I am at your old friend Andrew Rome's,<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> where I have
                received a very kind &amp; <hi rend="underline">homely</hi> welcome, exceedingly
                pleasant &amp; grateful to me. He sits alongside the table as I write reading a
                newspaper, &amp; asks me to give you his warmest regards &amp; to say that he hopes
                to have an opportunity of seeing you shortly. (Have asked him to come to Camden with
                me<ptr target="loc.04400_n2"/>&#8212;if only for the day.&#8212;Will see about it.)</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00998_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Have had a splendid day for my sail down the Hudson, &amp; have enjoyed it from
                beginning to end.&#8212;The beautiful &amp; luxuriously fitted steamboat was itself
                extremely interesting to begin with&#8212;Then the noble river with its beautiful
                banks on each side, of continually varying interest &amp; beauty during the whole
                sail. The clear blue sky, the light clouds on the horizon shadowing the hills, the
                cool delicious air, were all stimulating &amp; enjoyable. I struck up quite a
                friendship too with a young Massachusetts Doctor,<ptr target="n5001"/> &amp; we "chummed" together as far
                as Yonkers where he landed.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00999_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Finally the arrival at New York. (Desbrosses St.) I doubt if anyone ever entered New
                York under more favourable &amp; beautiful circumstances&#8212;The long, beautiful
                sail approaching it, culminating at the moment of arrival at our first stopping
                place&#8212;22nd Street&#8212;with a sunset of the most delicate loveliness, &amp;
                wide-arching amplitude&#8212;the sky flecked with cirrus clouds glowing warm golden
                on the underside, delicate pearl above&#8212;the reflections in the river,&#8212;the
                rapidly moving &amp; multitudinous boat ferries &#38;c,&#8212;the cities on each
                bank&#8212;the wharves &amp; steamers&#8212;all made up a living picture I shall
                never <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01000_large.jpg" type="verso"/> forget. The
                new moon hung in the sky, &amp; the Statue of Liberty uplifed her electric light in
                the distance.</p>
            <p>Then in the Annex boat to Brooklyn in the dusk, the Bridge lit along its whole course
                with lamps&#8212;Landing,&#8212;the Vanderbilt Avenue car, stopping about a block
                from here,&#8212;&amp; arrival here, Mr Rome looking out for me at the gate.</p>
            <p>A good letter from Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> awaiting me tells me that
                    Ingersoll<ptr target="n0839"/> will perhaps not speak on Monday night. In that
                case I will not come to Camden on Monday but will visit Long Island first. Will
                write again however.</p>
            <closer>
