            <p>I was to tell you about my acquaintanceship with Tennyson,<ptr target="n0625"/> 
                which was a pleasant episode in my life at Haslemere Hearing of the extreme
                beauty of the scenery thereabouts &amp; specially of its comparative wildness &amp;
                seclusion, he thought he would like to find or build a house, to escape from the
                obtrusive curiosity of the multitudes who flock to the Isle of 
                Wight<ptr target="loc.02861_n5"/> at certain

                old friend of mine, he called on me for particulars as to the resources of the
                neighbourhood&#8212;And I, good walker &amp; familiar with every least frequented spot of
                hill &amp; dale for some miles round, took him long rambles in quest of a site. Very
                pleasant rambles they were; Tennsyon, under the influence of the fresh, outdoor
                quite unconstrained life in new

                scenery &amp; with a cheerful aim, shaking off the languid ennuy&#233;e
                air, as of a man to whom nothing has longer a relish&#8212;bodily or mental that
                too often hangs about him. And we found something quite to his mind&#8212;a coppice

                near at hand the hill curving round in a fir-covered promontory, standing out very

                to hand&#8212;a sore disappointment
                to me, dear Friend. I can ill afford to lose the long &amp; eagerly watched for
                pleasure of a letter. If it seems to you there must needs be something unreal,
                illusive in a love that has grown up entirely without the basis of personal
                intercourse, dear Friend, then you do not yourself realize your own power, nor
                understand the full meaning of your own words&#8212;"whoso touches this, touches
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_cb.00095.jpg" type="recto"/>

                Real effects imply real causes. Do you suppose that an ideal figure conjured up by
                her own fancy could, in a perfectly sound healthy woman of my age; so happy in her
                children, so busy &amp; content, practical earnest, produce such real &amp;
                tremendous, effect&#8212;saturating her whole life, <choice>

                moment&#8212;filling her with such joys such such pains that the strain of them has
                been well nigh 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_cb.00094.jpg" type="verso"/>
                too much even for a strong frame, coming as it does, after twenty years of hard
                work? </p>
            <p>Therefore please dear Friend, do not "warn" me any more&#8212;it hurts so, as seeming
                to distrust my love&#8212;Time only can show how needlessly. My love, flowing ever
                fresh &amp; fresh out of my heart, will go with you in all your wanderings, dear
                Friend, enfolding you day and night soul &amp; body with tenderness that tries so
                vainly to utter itself in these poor helpless words, that clings closer than any
                man's love can cling. O, I could not live if I did not believe that sooner or later
                you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me &amp; saying "Come,
                my Darling."&#8212;When you get this will you post me an American News
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_cb.00040.jpg" type="recto"/>
                paper (any one you have done with) as a token it has reached you&#8212;&amp; so on at intervals during
                your wanderings; it will serve as a token that you are well, &amp; the post marks
                will tell me where you are&#8212;And thus you will feel free only to write when you have
                leisure &amp; inclination&#8212;&amp; I shall be spared that feeling <pb
                    xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc_cb.00041.jpg" type="verso"/> I have when I
                fancy my letters have not reached you&#8212;as if I were so hopelessly helplessly
                cut off from you which is more than I can stand. We all read American news eagerly
                too.&#8212;The children are so well &amp; working with all their might. The
                school turns but<!-- Harned has "out" --> more what I desired for them than I had
