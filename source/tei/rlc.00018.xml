                might be paralysis&#8212;I still keep around&#8212;am much more comfortable than
                four years ago, but am very lame &#38; clumsy, (yet red and stout)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Bjornson<ptr target="rlc.00018_n1"/> did not come to see me&#8212;America you know is
                a big country, &#38; he had many places to go to&#8212;I think Clemens Petersen<ptr
                    target="rlc.00018_n2"/> is still some where in this country&#8212;very likely
                doing well&#8212;the last time I saw him he came up to me (personally looked well)
                in New York, between two &#38; three years ago, in a crowd, &#38; only a few
                words&#8212;he is a quite well known literary person &#38; if he had died or any
                thing happened, I should have heard of it&#8212;</p>
            <p>I too mourn the death of Elster<ptr target="rlc.00018_n3"/>&#8212;though unknown I
                had formed a liking for him&#8212;I shall forward one of my books to

            <p>As I write it is Sunday, just before sunset&#8212;&#38; we have had a fine
                day&#8212;indeed a fine mild winter so far&#8212;have been in my room all day,
                writing &#38;c, very comfortable&#8212;shall now walk to the post office, &#38;
                probably sail once or twice across the river, the Delaware here, a mile
                wide&#8212;</p>
