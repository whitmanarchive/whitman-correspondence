                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of 22 Novr.<ptr target="loc.01877_n2"/> reached me the other day thro'
                Mr. Conway<ptr target="n0170"/>. You no doubt will by this time have received the
                one I addressed to you 2 or 3 weeks ago; but perhaps it may occur to me to repeat
                here some things said in that letter. I think the most convenient course may be for
                me first to state the facts about my Selection.</p>
            <p>Some while back&#8212;I suppose <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01877.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> before the middle of Septr.&#8212;Mr. Hotten<ptr target="n0311"/>
                the publisher told me that he projected bringing out a selection from your poems,
                &#38; (in consequence of my review<ptr target="duk.00503_n15"/> in the Chronicle) he
                asked whether I wd. undertake to make the selection, &#38; write any such prefatory
                    matter<ptr target="n0526"/> as I mt. think desirable. Proud to associate myself
                in any way with your writings, or to subserve their diffusion &#38; appreciation
                here, I gladly consented.</p>
            <p>I at once re-read thro' your last complete edition, &#38; made the selection. In
                doing this I was guided by two rules&#8212;1, to omit <hi rend="underline"
                    >entirely</hi> every poem wh. contains <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.01877.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> passages or words wh. modern
                squeamishness can raise an objection to&#8212;&#38; 2, to include, from among the
                remaining poems, those wh. I most entirely &#38; intensely admire. The bulk of poems
                thus selected is rather less than half the bulk of your complete edition; &#38;,
                before my selection went to the printer's hands, I had the advantage of revising it
                by the corrected copy you sent some while ago to Mr. Conway. I also added the prose
                Preface to Leaves of Grass&#8212;obtaining thro' Mr. Conway your permission to alter
                (or rather, as I have done, simply to <hi rend="underline">omit</hi>) 2 or 3 phrases
                in <hi rend="underline">that Preface</hi> (only). Thus my selection is a verbatim
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01877.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> reproduction
                of a good number of your poems, unaccompanied by the remainder. There is no
                curtailment or alteration whatever&#8212;&#38; no modification at all except in
                these 3 particulars&#8212;</p>
            <p>1. I have given a note here &#38; there:</p>
            <p>2. I have thought it better, considering the difference of a selection from the
                sum-total, to re-distribute the poems into 5 classes, which I have
                termed&#8212;Chants Democratic&#8212;Drum Taps<ptr target="n0819"/>&#8212;Walt
                Whitman&#8212;Leaves of Grass&#8212;Songs of Parting:<ptr target="n0580"/></p>
            <p>3. I have given <hi rend="underline">titles</hi> to many poems wh. in your editions
                are merely headed with the words of the opening line.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01877.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>The selection being thus made, I wrote a Prefatory Notice &#38; Dedicatory Letter;
                &#38; then consigned the whole affair to the publisher &#38; printer, somewhere in
                the earlier days of October. My prefatory matter, &#38; something like a third (I
                suppose) of the poems, were in print before your letter of 1 Novr.,<ptr
                    target="loc.01877_n3"/> addressed to Mr. Conway, reached me; &#38; now the
                Preface to Leaves of Grass is also in print, &#38; I fancy the whole thing ought to
                be completed &#38; out by Xmas, or very soon after.</p>
            <p>The letter wh. I wrote you<ptr target="loc.01877_n4"/> on receipt of yours of 1 Novr.
                said that I was about to consult the <pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc.01877.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> publisher as to dropping the mere
                selection, &#38; substituting a complete edition, only with slight verbal
                modifications. This however the publisher proved unwilling to do, the selection
                being so far advanced, advertised, &#38;c. Therefore the selection will come out
                exactly as first put together; &#38; on reflection this pleased me decidedly
                better.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to reply to the details of your letter of 22 Novr.</p>
            <p>If any blockhead chooses to call my selection "an expurgated edition," that lie shall
                be on his own head, not mine. My Prefatory Notice explains my principle of selection
                to exactly the same effect as given in this present letter; &#38;
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01877.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            contains moreover a longish passage affirming that, if such freedom of speech as you
                adopt were denied to others, all the great literature of the whole world wd. be
                castrated or condemned.</p>
            <p>The form of title–page wh. you propose wd. of course be adopted by me with thanks
                &#38; without a moment's debate, were it not that my own title–page was previously
                in print: I enclose a copy.<ptr target="n5002f"/> I trust you may see nothing in it
                to disapprove&#8212;as indeed in essentials it comes to much the same as your own
                model. However, I have already written to the publisher, suggesting that he shd.
                decide, according to the conveniences <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                    facs="loc.01877.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of the printing arrangements,
                which of the two shall eventually appear.</p>
            <p>In making my selection, I preserved all (I believe <hi rend="underline">all</hi>)
                "the larger figures dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections," but did
                not preserve the numbers of the stanzas,&#8212;the <hi rend="underline"
                    >separation</hi> of stanzas, however, continuing as in your edition. I am sorry
                now that I did not meet your preference in this respect, &#38; that the printing has
                already proceeded too far for me to revert to the small numbers now. My wish was to
                get rid of anything of a merely external kind wh. ordinary readers wd. call peculiar
                or eccentric. Parrot–like repetitions <pb xml:id="leaf005r"
                    facs="loc.01877.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/> of that charge have been too
                numerous already.</p>
            <p>I need scarcely assure you that that most glorious poem on Lincoln <hi
                    rend="underline">is</hi> included in my Selection. It shall appear with your
                title "President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn."<ptr target="n0694"/> I had previously
                given it a title of my own, "Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln"; &#38; in my
                Prefatory Notice it is alluded to under that title. A note of explanation shall be
                given.</p>
            <p>I await with impatience the receipt of your paper on Democracy.<ptr
                    target="duk.00508_n12"/> It will find in me no reluctant hearer, as I have
                always been a democratic republican, &#38; hope to live &#38; die faithful to the
                    <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.01877.010_large.jpg" type="verso"/> meanings of
                that glorious creed. The other printed matter you have so kindly sent me<ptr
                    target="n5002f"/> I received two evenings back from Mr. Conway. The newspaper
                articles are new to me: with the publications of Mr. O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/>
                &#38; Mr. Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> I was already familiar, &#38; I entertain a
                real respect for those publications &#38; their writers.</p>
            <p>Believe me, I am grateful to you for your kindness in these matters, &#38; for the
                indulgent eye with which you look upon a project which perhaps, after all, you wd.
                rather had never been entered upon. I am in some hopes that your indulgence will not
                    <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.01877.011_large.jpg" type="recto"/> be
                diminished when you see what the selection itself actually looks like. In
                consequence of the correspondence wh. has passed since the selection was made, I may
                possibly find occasion to add a brief P.S.: it shall contain nothing you cd. object
                to. If the selection aids the general body of English poetical readers to understand
                that there really is a great poet across the Atlantic, &#38; to demand a complete
                &#38; unmutilated edition, my desires connected with the selection will be
                accomplished.</p>
