                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of 22 Nov.<!--we will want to add a link to this letter--> reached me the
                other day <choice>
                    <orig>thro'</orig>
                    <reg>through</reg>
                </choice> Mr. Conway. You no doubt will by this time have received<!--re-ceived-->
                the one I addressed to you 2 or 3 weeks ago; but perhaps it may occur to me to
                repeat here some thing said in that letter. I think the most convenient course may
                be for me first to state the facts about my Selection.</p>

            <p>Some while back&#8212;I suppose <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01877.002.jpg" type="verso"/>before the middle of Sept.&#8212;Mr. Hotten<!-- <ptr target="n0311"/> -->
                the publisher told me that he projected bringing out a
                selection<!--Traubel uses uppercase S for Selection--> from your poems, &amp; (in
                consequence of my review in the Chronicle) he asked whether I <choice>
                    <abbr>wd.</abbr>
                    <expan>would</expan>
                </choice> undertake to make the selection, &amp; write any such prefatory matter<!-- <ptr target="n0526"/> --> as I <choice>
                    <abbr>mt.</abbr>
                    <expan>might</expan>
                </choice> think desirable. Proud to associate myself in any way with your writings,
                or to subserve their diffusion &amp; appreciation <!--appre-ciation--> here, I
                gladly consented.</p>

            <p>I at once re-read <choice>
                    <abbr>thro'</abbr>
                    <expan>through</expan>
                </choice> your last complete edition, &amp; made the selection. In doing this I was
                guided by two rules&#8212;1, to omit <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi> every poem <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> contains <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01877.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                passages or words <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> modern squeamishness can raise an objection<!--objec-tion-->
                to&#8212;&amp; 2, to include, from among the remaining poems, those <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> I most entirely &amp; intensely admire. The bulk of poems thus selected is
                rather<!--ra-ther--> less than half the bulk of your complete edition; &amp;, before
                my selection went to the printer's hands, I had the advantage of revising it by the
                corrected copy you sent some while ago to Mr. Conway<!-- <ptr target="n0170"/> -->. I also
                added the prose Preface to Leaves of Grass&#8212;obtaining <choice>
                    <orig>thro'</orig>
                    <reg>through</reg>
                </choice> Mr. Conway<!--Con-way--> your permission to alter (or rather, as I have
                done, simply to <hi rend="underline">omit</hi>) 2 or 3 phrases in <hi rend="underline">that Preface</hi> (only). Thus my selection is a verbatim <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01877.004.jpg" type="verso"/> reproduction of a good
                number of your poems, unaccompanied by the remainder. There is no
                curtailment<!--curtail-ment--> or alteration whatever&#8212;&amp; no modification at
                all except in these 3 particulars&#8212;</p>

            <!--Check formatting: do we want to create a list, or are the paragraph tags enough?-->
            <p>1. I have given a note here &amp; there:</p>
            <p>2. I have thought it better, considering<!--consi-dering--> the difference of a
                selection from the sum total, to re-distribute<!--re-dis-tribute--> the poems into 5
                classes which I have termed&#8212;Chants Democratic&#8212;Drum Taps&#8212;Walt
                Whitman&#8212;Leaves of Grass&#8212;Songs of Parting<!-- <ptr target="n0580"/> -->:</p>
            <p>3. I have given <hi rend="underline">titles</hi> to many poems<!--po-ems-->
                <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> in your editions are merely headed with the words of the opening line.</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01877.005.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>The selection being thus made, I wrote a Prefatory Notice &amp; Dedication Letter;
                &amp; then consigned<!--con-signed--> the whole affair to the publisher &amp;
                printer, somewhere in the earlier days of October. My prefatory matter, &amp;
                something like a third (I suppose) of the poems, were in print before your letter of
                1 Nov.<!--add link to this letter--> addressed to Mr. Conway, reached me; &amp; now
                the Preface to <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> is also in print, &amp; I
                fancy the whole thing ought to be completed &amp; out by Xmas, or very soon
                after.</p>

            <p>The letter <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> I wrote you<!--add link to this letter--> on receipt of yours of Nov. said
                that I was about to consult the <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01877.006.jpg" type="verso"/> publisher as to dropping the mere selection, &amp; substituting a
                complete edition, only with slight verbal modifications. This however the publisher
                proved unwilling to do, the selection being so far advanced, advertised, &amp;c.
                therefore the selection<!--Traubel uses UC 'S' as in Selection--> will come out
                exactly as first put together; &amp; on reflection this pleased me decidedly
                better.</p>

            <p>I now proceed to reply to the details of your letter of 22
                Nov.<!--add link to this letter--></p>

            <p>If any blockhead chooses to call my selection<!--Traubel capitalizes Selection--> "an
                expurgated edition," that lie shall be on his own head, not mine. My Prefatory
                Notice explains my principle of selection to exactly the same effect as given in
                this present letter; &amp;</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.01877.007.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>contains moreover a longish passage<!--pas-sage--> affirming that, if such freedom of
                speech as you adopt were denied to others, all the great literature of the whole
                world <choice>
                    <abbr>wd.</abbr>
                    <expan>would</expan>
                </choice> be castrated or condemned.</p>

            <p>The form of title–page<!-- <ptr target="n0527"/> -->
                <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> you propose<!--In which letter to WMR does WW propose a title page? Perhaps a link to that letter here-->
                <choice>
                    <abbr>wd.</abbr>
                    <expan>would</expan>
                </choice> of course be adopted by me with thanks &amp; without a moment's debate,
                were it not that my own title–page was previously in print: I enclose a
                copy.<!--The Feinberg microfilm does not include an image of WMR's title-page.-->I
                trust you may see nothing in it to disapprove&#8212;as indeed in essentials it comes
                to much the same as your own model. However, I have already written to the
                publisher, suggesting that he <choice>
                    <abbr>shd</abbr>
                    <expan>should</expan>
                </choice> decide, according to the conveniences<!--convenien-ces, the hyphen at page break-->
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.01877.008.jpg" type="verso"/> of the printing
                arrangements, which of the two shall eventually appear.</p>

            <p>In making my selection, I preserved all (I believe <hi rend="underline">all</hi>)
                "the larger figures dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections," but did
                not preserve the numbers of the stanzas,&#8212;the <hi rend="underline">separation</hi> of stanzas, however, continuing as in your edition. I am sorry
                now that I did not meet your preference in this respect, &amp; that the printing has
                already proceeded too far for me to revert to the small numbers now. My wish was to
                get rid of anything of a merely external kind <choice>
                    <abbr>wh.</abbr>
                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> ordinary readers <choice>
                    <abbr>wd.</abbr>
                    <expan>would</expan>
                </choice> call peculiar or eccentric. Parrot–like repetitions <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.01877.009.jpg" type="recto"/> of that change have
                been too numerous<!--nu-merous--> already.</p>
            <p>I need scarcely assure you that that most glorious poem on Lincoln <hi rend="underline">is</hi> included in my
                Selection.<!--Selec-tion; Ought this be capitalized? I go back and forth on Rossetti's S/s-->
                It shall appear with your title "President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn."<!-- <ptr target="n0694"/> --> I had previously
                given it a title of my own, "Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln"; &amp; in my
                Prefatory Notice it is alluded to under that title. A note of
                explanation<!--ex-planation--> shall be given.</p>

            <p>I await with impatience the receipt of your paper on Democracy.<!--Demo-cracy--> It
                will find in me no reluctant<!--reluc-tant--> hearer, as I have always been a
                democratic republican, &amp; hope to live &amp; die faithful to the <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.01877.010.jpg" type="verso"/>meanings of that
                glorious creed. The other printed
                matter<!--do we know exactly what printed matter WW sent to WMR? At least newspaper articles by O'Connor and Burroughs; which ones?-->
                you have so kindly sent me I received two evenings back from Mr.
                Conway<!--Con-way-->. The newspaper articles are new to me: with the publications of
                Mr. O'Connor<!-- <ptr target="n0452"/> --> &amp; Mr. Burroughs<!--annotation--> I was already
                familiar, &amp; I entertain<!--enter-tain--> a real respect for those publications
                &amp; their writers.</p>

            <p>Believe me, I am grateful to you for your kindness in these matters, &amp; for the
                indulgent eye with which you look upon a project which perhaps, after
                all,<!--almost looks like a semi-colon here, although the flow of the sentence does not indicate a semi-colon-->
                you <choice>

                indulgence will not <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.01877.011.jpg" type="recto"/> be
                diminished when you see what the Selection<!--Rossetti's "S/s"?--> itself actually
                looks like. In consequence of the correspondence <choice>

                    <expan>which</expan>

                add a brief P.S.: it shall contain nothing you <choice>
                    <abbr>cd.</abbr>
                    <expan>could</expan>
                </choice> object to. If the selection aids the general body of English poetical
                readers to understand<!--under-stand--> that there really is a great poet across the
                Atlantic, &amp; to demand<!--de-mand--> a complete &amp; unmutilated edition, my
