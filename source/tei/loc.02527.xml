            <p>I send you my best thanks for your kind p.c. of Oct 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02527_n2"/> 
                telling me about J.W.W.'s<ptr target="n6121"/> return "from a pleasant visit to the 
                Staffords,"<ptr target="n1009"/> &#38; that "O'Connor's<ptr target="n2002"/> book, 'Three Tales'
                is out."<ptr target="loc.02527_n3"/> I will order copies of it thru H. L. T.<ptr target="n4267"/></p>
            <p>I much regret to hear of your "bad spell" &#38; send you my warmest sympathy &#38; my
                best wishes for its speedy abatement.</p>
            <p>I have also to thank <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02527.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> you for the <hi rend="underline">Philadephia Record</hi> with the

            <p>The paragraph was somewhat alarming &#38; Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> came
                down here last night to see me about it. He was surprised to know that I had
                received a p.c. from you (he thought you might be too ill to write) &#38; upon my
                shewing it to him he exclaimed&#8212;</p>
            <p>"Oh, th'owd chap's not dead yet! A chap as can write like <hi rend="underline">that</hi>'s a long way off

                the "beautiful caligraphy" of Wallace).</p> 
            <p>Your special references of late to Fred have made him a proud man; &#38; in the
                course of our talk last night he said that he felt it a "tremendous honour" &#38;
                one wh. he appreciated very sincerely&#8212; We are, indeed, <hi rend="underline">all</hi> proud 
                of your special recognition of the worth of our leal-hearted Comrade.</p>
            <p>In a letter I received yesterday from your friend Prof. Brinton,<ptr target="n3134"/>
                in acknowledging the receipt of a copy of my "Notes,"<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/> he says:&#8212;"Your
                appreciation of his (Whitman's) broad &#38; sympathetic <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
