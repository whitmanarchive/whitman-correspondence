            </opener>
            <p>Swinburne<!--<ptr target="n0610"/>--> has just written to me to say as follows.</p>
            <p>"I am sincerely interested and gratified by your account of Walt Whitman and the
                assurance of his kindly and friendly feeling towards me: and I thank you, no less
                sincerely, for your kindness in sending me word of it. As sincerely can I say, what
                I shall be freshly obliged to you if you will assure him 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01313_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                of in my name, that I have
                by no manner of means relaxed my admiration of his noblest works&#8212;such parts,
                above all, of his writings, as treat of the noblest subjects, material and
                spiritual, with which poetry can deal&#8212;I have always thought it, and I believe
                it will be hereafter generally thought his highest and surely 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01314_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                most enviable
                distinction that he never speaks so well as when he speaks of great
                matters&#8212;Liberty, for instance, and Death.</p>
            <p>This of course does not imply that I do, or rather it implies that I do not agree
                with all his theories, or admire all his work in anything like equal measure&#8212;a
                form of admiration which I should by no means desire for myself and am as little
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01315_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                prepared to bestow on another&#8212;considering it a form of scarcely indirect
                insult"</p>
            <p>There! You see how you remain in our hearts&#8212;and how simply and grandly
                Swinburne speaks of you knowing you to be simple and grand yourself.</p>
            <p>Will you in return send me for Swinburne a copy of your

                Essay on Poetry&#8212;the
                pamphlet&#8212;with your name and his on it&#8212;it would please him so much.
                Before I leave America I must see you again&#8212;there is no one in this wide great
                world of America whom I love and honor so much.</p>
