            <p>As I am visiting your son Alfred<ptr target="loc.00842_n1"/> occasionally, to cheer him up in his sickness in hospital, I thought you might like a few words, though from a stranger, yet a friend to your boy. I was there last night, and sat a while by the bed, as usual, &amp; he showed me the letter he had just received from home. He wrote to you yesterday. He has had diarrhea pretty bad, but is now improved &amp; goes about the hospital&#8212;but as the weather is pretty hot &amp; powerful in the midst of the day, I advised him not to go outdoors much at present. What he wants most is rest, and a chance to get his strength again. I expect he will improve by degrees, &amp; I hope it will not be very long before he will be sent home&#8212;though I don't know, as I am only a friend, occasionally visiting the hospitals. Alfred has good accommodations where he is, &amp; a good doctor, &amp; nursing&#8212;so you must not worry about him. I shall stop &amp; see him a little every day, as he likes to have me, &amp; I like him too. Poor young men, there are hundreds &amp; thousands of them here, wounded or sick, in the great army hospitals&#8212;many of them suffering with amputations &amp; wounds&#8212;others with sickness, &amp; so faint &amp; weak, this weather&#8212;it is enough to make one's heart bleed&#8212;</p>
            <p>As to Alfred, he is comparatively well off, there are so many with bad wounds &amp;c.&#8212;the deaths are quite frequent. He will soon be restored, according to present appearances.</p>
            <p>We are having very hot weather here, &amp; it is dry &amp; dusty&#8212;The City is alive with soldiers from both the Army of the Potomac &amp; the Western Armies, brought here by Sherman. There have been some great Reviews here, as you have seen in the papers&#8212;&amp; thousands of soldiers are going home every day.</p>
            <p>You must write to Alfred often, as it cheers up a boy sick &amp; away from home. Write all about domestic &amp; farm incidents, and as cheerful as may be. Direct to him, in Ward C, Armory Square Hospital, Washington, D. C. Should any thing occur, I will write you again, but I feel confident he will continue doing well. For the present farewell.</p>
