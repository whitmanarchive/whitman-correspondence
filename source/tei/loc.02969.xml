                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>If things go on as they have for the past week, you will have to think yourself lucky
                if you get even a postal in ten days. You must remember that I am housekeeper,
                nurse, marketer, &#38; have to see that the house is decent, if 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02969.002.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                possible, besides being interrupted at every ten minutes to answer some one who calls from a good
                motive to ask how W<hi rend="underline">m</hi>.<ptr target="n2002"/> is, but would
                do better not to come often.</p>

            <p>So far I am the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> nurse, &#38; if you have been as badly
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02969.003.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                off as he is, you may have some idea of what it means. In this case it means that I wash &#38; dress
                him so far as he can be dressed,&#8212;wash his urinals, for he has to be protected
                night &#38; day, from the constant dripping,&#8212;&#38; to keep <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02969.004.jpg" type="verso"/> him at all clean is
                nearly impossible. Some nights I get not more than four hours sleep &#38; that very
                broken, &#38; some days not one moment to rest at all. To-day I am nearly blind from
                loss of sleep. We have some very bad nights since the <pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc_as.00155_large.jpg" type="recto"/> attack four weeks ago, &#38; one of
                the very bad and troublesome developments is the nausea and throwing up, so you see
                that I am not very idle, &#38; I some days could not write a postal card to save
                you. You will ask <hi rend="underline">why</hi> we don't have a nurse? the <pb
                    xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_as.00156_large.jpg" type="verso"/> answer is William
                does not want one, &#38; is not ready yet, he sends love to you &#38; says tell you
                he would write if he could.</p>
