            <p>I was highly pleased with the article of Col Stinton and think he even drew mildly
                upon facts as to your Hospital career. none perhaps can appreciate the kindness
                extended by you, more than I, while a hospital <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#kk">truant</unclear>, stranger like them, yet the
                positiveness of your nature drew upon those lives of friendship and fellow love,
                that in many natures <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01980.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> are not reached by years of culture. Slow as I have always been
                to form friends, I found myself anxious to call you such in a few short
                days&#8212;and how many more have you met like me in the past eight years. But more
                of this anon, how no doubt "Leaves of Grass"<!-- annotation --> will progress to a

                welfare of our common country at heart refuse to lend that helping hand they now so
