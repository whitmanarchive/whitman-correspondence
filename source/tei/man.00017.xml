                <salute>Dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitman</salute></opener>

            <p>Last year, in June '78. I was the means of introducing your book to a M<hi
                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alexander, in the North of Ireland. She wrote at that
                time to you, enclosing a money order for &#163;1-6-0 for one of your books, I think
                the Two Rivulets. A couple of months afterwards I heard that she
                had never received any answer, &amp; after some time I wrote to my friend Professor
                Dowden<ptr target="n0199"/> whom I knew to be in correspondence with you, asking him
                to mention the circumstance to you when he next wrote. I think he must have
                forgotten to do this, as I have heard again <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="man_ej.00175_large.jpg" type="verso"/>today that M<hi rend="superscript"
                    >rs</hi> Alexander has not received the book. Therefore I thought better to
                write to you myself, as having given her your address, &amp;c. I feel myself in a certain degree
                responsible. I heard that at the time you should have received her letter you were away
                from home. I concluded that the letter failed somehow to reach you. And it has also
                occurred to me that perhaps your last edition is out &amp; you have no more copies
                to send&#8212;or that you may have mislaid the letter &amp; address.</p>

            <p>So I should be much obliged if you would let me have a line today whether <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="man_ej.00176_large.jpg" type="recto"/>you ever received
                it, or not, &amp; if your books are obtainable from you still in the usual way.</p>
            <p>You have forgotten no doubt a letter I wrote you some years ago while an
                undergraduate in College, thanking you as deeply as I could find words to do for the
                spiritual health and thought I had found <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">or gained</unclear> in the Leaves of
                Grass. I cannot let this occasion pass without renewing my
                thanks, sending you again my greeting and love. Your book has travelled with me
                wherever I have gone. I have joined hands with you in it, tried to realize its
                ideals in my life; and to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">lead</unclear> others to do so, often I am glad to say with success. homage like this you
                must have often received, nevertheless I think you will <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="man_ej.00015_large.jpg" type="verso"/>hardly think very lightly of any one&#8212;and
                this makes me feel encouraged to tell you freely what you have done
                for me.</p>

                    &amp; let me know, I will enclose you the money if not received. Her address is
