            <p>Thanks for the paper "A Ship over Niagara" &amp; "Parodies."<ptr target="syr.00037_n2"/> I recollect the story of the ship very well, it was
                often told and referred to when I was a little boy. Your letter of 23<hi rend="underline">d</hi> and 24<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="syr.00037_n3"/> also came this morning. I am glad the binding is settled
                and I think from your description it will do very well tho' nothing to become
                especially enthusiastic about. I shall be glad to see it. Will not the price of
                binding cut into the price of the book a good deal? [—] $1.24 is a big
                slice off $6. [—] The price of the book should have been more than
                $6. I would not have put it a cent below $10. if I had had my way.<ptr target="syr.00037_n4"/> I predict that a copy of that book will be worth
                $50 in ten years and $100. in 25 years. But I suppose you will say "we are
                living in '89 not '99 or '14." [—] So Rice <ptr target="n6004"/> wants you to
                write for his review?<ptr target="syr.00037_n5"/> I wouldn't mind if he would print
                some pieces written by your friends and leave out such miserable trash as that
                written by Kennedy<ptr target="syr.00037_n6"/> a few years ago—Do you
                recollect when Pearsall Smith<ptr target="n6122"/> brought it home and reads
                extracts from it at the teatable? The Inspector came while I was writing the above
                and I had to break off [.] (It is now <hi rend="underline">noon, Sunday)</hi> [.] at
                11.30 last night a fire broke out in the north cottage I was at work there untill
                5o'c. this morning. The centre building was gutted but no life lost. The damage
                [mutilation] will be $4000 or $5000. [—] A lively snow storm has set
                in, we may have sleighing at last (the last snow storm /I/ told you about was a
                failure, did not amount to any thing after all /no sleighing at all this winter
                yet./). Every body at the asylum is hard at work making provision for accommodation
                of the sixty patients who occupied the north cottage. Goodly, dear Walt</p>
