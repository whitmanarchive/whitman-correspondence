            <p>I havn't heard any news from home now in more than a week, I hope you are well, dear Mother, &amp; all the rest too&#8212;there is nothing new or different with me&#8212;I can only write you the same old story about going to the hospitals &amp;c &amp;c.&#8212;I have not heard any thing since from George&#8212;have you heard any thing further?<ptr target="loc.00818_n1"/> I have writ to him, to Annapolis&#8212;We are having it pretty warm here to-day, after a long spell of rain storms, but the last two or three days very fine&#8212;Mother, I suppose you got my letter of last Tuesday, 12th&#8212;</p>
            <p>I went down to the Capitol the nights of the debate on the expulsion of Mr Long<ptr target="loc.00818_n2"/> last week&#8212;they had night sessions, very late&#8212;I like to go to the House of Representatives at night, it is the most magnificent hall, so rich &amp; large, &amp; lighter at night than it is days, &amp; still not a light visible, it comes through the glass roof&#8212;but the speaking &amp; ability of the members is nearly always on a low scale, it is very curious &amp; melancholy to see such a rate of talent there, such tremendous times as these&#8212;I should say about the same range of genius as our old friend Dr Swalm,<ptr target="loc.00818_n3"/> just about&#8212;you may think I am joking, but I am not, Mother&#8212;I am speaking in perfect earnest&#8212;the Capitol grows upon one in time, especially as they have got the great figure on top of it now, &amp; you can see it very well, it is a great bronze figure, the Genius of Liberty<ptr target="loc.00818_n4"/> I suppose&#8212;it looks wonderful toward sundown, I love to go down &amp; look at it, the sun when it is nearly down shines on the headpiece &amp; it dazzles &amp; glistens like a big star, it looks quite curious&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, Mother, we have commenced on another summer, &amp; what it will bring forth who can tell?&#8212;the campaign of this summer is expected here to be more active &amp; severe than any yet&#8212;As I told you in a former letter Grant is determined to bend every thing to take Richmond &amp; break up the banditti of scoundrels that have stuck themselves up there as a "government"&#8212;he is in earnest about it, his whole soul &amp; all his thoughts night &amp; day are upon it&#8212;he is probably the most in earnest of any man in command or in the government either&#8212;that's something, ain't it, Mother&#8212;&amp; they are bending every thing to fight for their last chance&#8212;calling in their forces from southwest &amp;c&#8212;Dear Mother, give my love to dear brother Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all&#8212;I write this in my room, 6th st&#8212;</p>
