            <p>Your letter came all right&#8212;&amp; I was glad to hear from you, boy, &amp; to know that you had got home to your own folks at last&#8212;&amp; now I hope you will get well &amp; strong again, dear son&#8212;&amp; I hope it may be God's will that you will not only get so, but keep so.<ptr target="loc.00843_n2"/> Armory Square hospital is broken up, &amp; all the sick &amp; wounded have been taken away, or forwarded home. I have not seen No. 6. in Ward C. that you speak of, but shall no doubt meet him soon, &amp; that little matter is all right any how.<ptr target="loc.00843_n3"/> Al, you was quite low, one time there in the Hospital&#8212;&amp; the worst of it was you was down-hearted &amp; homesick, &amp; said nothing to any body&#8212;only when I came around, &amp; we soon had quite a love toward each other, &amp; no doubt that did you good&#8212;only I now regret that I did not do more for you, &amp; come to see you oftener.</p>
            <p>I am working now in the Attorney General's office. This is the place where the big southerners now come up to get pardoned&#8212;all the rich men &amp; big officers of the reb army have to get special pardons, before they can buy or sell, or do any thing that will stand law&#8212;Sometimes there is a steady stream of them coming in here&#8212;old &amp; young, men &amp; women&#8212;some of the men are odd looking characters&#8212;I talk with them often, &amp; find it very interesting to listen to their descriptions of things that have happened down south, &amp; to how things are there now, &amp;c. There are between 4 &amp; 5000 pardons issued from this Office, but only about 200 have been signed by the President&#8212;The rest he is letting wait, till he gets good &amp; ready&#8212;What I hear &amp; see about Andrew Johnson, I think he is a <hi rend="italic">good man</hi>&#8212;sometimes some of the letters he gets are sent over to this office to be answered&#8212;&amp; occasionally that job falls to me&#8212;One of them was a letter a few days ago from a widow woman in Westfield, N Y. Her husband was in Texas when the war broke out, joined our army&#8212;&amp; was killed by the rebels&#8212;they also confiscated his property in Texas, leaving his family helpless&#8212;this lady wrote to the President for aid, &amp;c&#8212;I wrote the President's answer&#8212;telling her that she should have her husband's pension, which would be pretty good, as he was a captain&#8212;&amp; that the rebs in Texas could not hold any such property, but that she could bring a suit &amp; get it back, &amp;c.&#8212;then put in a few words to cheer her up, &amp;c.&#8212;</p>

            <p>Dear son, I did not finish my letter because I have not been able to get the little picture of Lincoln &amp; Washington<ptr target="loc.00843_n4"/>&#8212;but I succeeded in getting one this morning&#8212;I send it as a little present to my dear boy, &amp; I hope it will please him, for there is something about it that is both pleasing &amp; solemn to me, though but a small picture&#8212;We are having a cloudy drizzly day here &amp; heavy mist&#8212;There is nothing very new or special&#8212;There was a big match played here yesterday between two base ball clubs, one from Philadelphia &amp; the other a Washington club&#8212;&amp; to-day another is to come off between a New York &amp; the Philadelphia club I believe&#8212;thousands go to see them play<ptr target="loc.00843_n5"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>I keep well, &amp; every body says I am getting fat &amp; hearty&#8212;I live at the same place in M street, 468&#8212;only I have moved into the front room&#8212;it is pleasanter&#8212;I have my meals brought up to me&#8212;my landlady gives me very good grub, $32.50 a month&#8212;Well I must draw to a close, as the sheet is most full&#8212;When you write, to let me know how you are, &amp; if you have rec'd this, direct to me, <hi rend="italic">Attorney General's office</hi>, Washington D. C.</p>
            <p>Now, Ally, I must bid you good by, &amp; I send you my love, my darling boy, &amp; also to your parents, for your sake&#8212;you must try to be a good young man &amp; behave right &amp; manly, for that is far more than worldly prosperity&#8212;Farewell, dear son,</p>
