            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of Sept. 29, enclosing two more slips of the Preface came duly, but now
                that I am in office, &amp; have to leave at 8 A. M. &amp; don't get home till near
                or quite 5 P. M. I am so tired that I can't even touch a pen at night. I am in for
                two months, as the Census work is<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03003.004.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> closing up in part. It has been a hard &amp; busy summer, &amp;
                that is why you did not hear from me. I had to work just as hard for the examination
                for this office, as for any, &amp; had to pass an examination, &amp; then work to
                get in.</p>

            <p>So now with my moving, &amp;house-keeping, &amp; getting through with a day in the
                office, you can say that I am <hi rend="underline">busy</hi>.<pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.03003.005.jpg" type="recto"/> Thank you again for the Preface. I am
                pleased with it, for I know you wrote <hi rend="underline">what you felt to
                    write</hi>. I know that you &amp; I feel more &amp; more a most tender &amp;
                growing love for dear William,<ptr target="n2002"/> &amp; all his noble &amp;
                generous qualities show out to me by contrast, all the time. I don't find others
                like him, tho' I have nothing to<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03003.006.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> complain of; &amp; have warm &amp; loyal friends.</p>



            <p>I have a vivid picture of you, as you sit in your room. I Hope we shall have fine
                weather, &amp; that you will enjoy it.</p>
            <p>My sister Jeanine, Mrs. Channing, will be here before the month ends, I hope.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>With thanks again&#8212;</salute>
