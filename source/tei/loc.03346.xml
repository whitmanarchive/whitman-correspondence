                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute> 
            </opener> 
            <p>I enclose for your information a letter I got yesterday from Dr. Channing<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> about the calendar,<ptr target="n4181"/> which reads well.</p>
            <p>Today I have a letter from Stedman,<ptr target="n1043"/> in which he cordially
                undertakes the task of getting a publisher. I think this very good of him, as he is
                quite driven with all sorts of commissions.</p>
            <p>I feel sorry that the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03346.002.jpg" type="verso"/> delay of last year, prevented our getting Mr. Stetson<ptr target="n6144"/> to draw the
                picture I wrote you of for the card, because he is a man of singular genius, and
                appreciates deeply <hi rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi>, the central sum of
                which, and permeating all its parts without exception, is, he thinks, spirituality.
                I think he would have given us something rarely good — something artistically
                bold, anyway, though maybe not. But he cannot do it this year, and I understand is
                getting ready to go for study to Italy.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03346.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I did not know that the <hi rend="underline">M.S.</hi> of the calendar was to be
                placed in Stedman's hands, but it could not be better nor friendlier.</p>
            <p>Send me back the letter when you have done with it, that I may write to Dr. Channing,
                who has been very laborious and earnest in the matter. Grace,<ptr target="loc.03346_n1"/> the cherub deviser of
                the scheme, is now up at Bristol, Rhode Island.</p>
            <p>I have been much comforted by the newspaper reports about you, as by your card of the
                27th ultimo, though I realize how badly ill you still must be. But I have strong hopes. If you <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03346.004.jpg" type="verso"/> can but weather
                the summer!</p>
            <p>I myself am pretty bad— very back-achy and weak-leggy. But, like Webster, we
                still live, and who can get us under!</p>
            <p>I am glad you can sit up and work a little on your book,<ptr target="loc.03346_n2"/> which must be a comfort.</p>
            <p>I have another letter from Dr. Bucke,<ptr target="n0119"/> whom I treat
                disgracefully, not answering promptly. But it is pretty hard to write and keep the
                office stone rolled up the hill daily.</p>
            <p>All consolation! All cheer!</p>
