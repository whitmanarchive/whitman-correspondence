                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>    
            </opener>
            <p>I wrote to you last evening,<ptr target="loc.02516_n3"/> &#38; after a short letter to Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> spent the rest of the evening in chatting with Mr<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/>
                &#38; M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi><ptr target="loc.07826_n6"/> Rome&#8212;about old memories of you, the changes in Brooklyn, persons &#38; places in 
                Annan, Scotland<ptr target="loc.04401_n3"/> &#38;c.</p>
            <p>This morning we had breakfast a little after 7, &#38; M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Rome &#38; son<ptr target="n5001"/> went to business. I followed them
                shortly after to see if there was
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                any letter there for me. I was glad at heart when Andrew Rome gave me a letter from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. Tom Rome<ptr target="duk.00466_n4"/> came up
                at the same time &#38; Andrew introduced us. After a very brief talk I opened your letter &#38; read it aloud to them both. How
                wonderfully it fitted in! How could it have been better? Through me you addressed a message of grateful &#38; affectionate memories
                &#38; love to them both&#8212;&#38; there I received it in their actual presence, &#38; without knowing its contents read it aloud to them
                both! You should have seen the look that came into
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                their faces&#8212;as of a tender veil of mist over silent granite rocks. And before I came away Andrew Rome said he would try to come
                with me to Camden when I come&#8212;coming in the morning, returning at evening.</p> 
            <p>He came out with me &#38; took me to Cranberry St&#8212;to the old office where you printed the Leaves. (Room now occupied by a bookbinder.)
                I stood a little in front of the window where you set the type&#8212;&#38; in the corner where you used to sit to read the "Tribune" when
                you called in each morning.</p>
            <p>Then he went back to business &#38; I went down to the Fulton Ferry. I crossed &#38; came back again&#8212;reading your poem again, &#38;
                observing &#38; absorbing all I could.<ptr target="loc.04401_n2"/> I find that your friend, John Baulson<ptr target="n5001"/>
                has given up work as 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                pilot&#8212;"gave it up a month ago of his own accord," the man said.</p>
            <p>I walked across the Bridge &#38; spent a little time in New York &#38; then came back to dinner as promised. Am now writing letters, &#38; by
                the time I have done Rome will come back here for a walk in Brooklyn with me.</p>
            <p>Then I propose to go to Huntington, Long Island, for the week end&#8212;to visit West Hills &#38;c. Will perhaps come back Sunday night or
                Monday morning&#8212;but should like to stay till Monday night, &#38; may perhaps do so. Then another day or so in N.Y. before coming
                on&#8212;but will write to you again.</p>
            <p>A. H. R told me at dinner that he met Ex-mayor Stryker<ptr target="loc.04401_n4"/> this morning. They spoke about you, &#38; R. said he hoped to see you 
                soon, &#38; S. commissioned him to convey his regards.
