            <p>First thank you again for the handsome money present of some months ago, wh' did me
                more good than you perhaps think for—it has helped me in meals, clothing,
                debts, &amp;c., ever since. My best help however has come in my old age &amp;
                paralysis from the Br: Islands. The piece in yr paper (was it early in May last?)
                from "a distinguished American man of letters" abt me was a very large inflation
                into fiction of a very little amt of fact—in spirit it is altogether, &amp; in
                letter mainly untrue (abt my affairs &amp;c.).<ptr target="med.00750_n1"/> My income
                from my books, (royalties &amp;c.) does not reach $100 a year.<ptr target="med.00750_n3"/> I am now in my 69th year—living plainly but very
                comfortably in a little wooden cottage of my own, good spirits invariably, but
                physically a sad wreck, failing more and more each successive season, unable even to
                get abt the house without help—most of the time though without serious pain or
                suffering, except extreme weakness wh' I have a good deal—the paralysis that
                prostrated me after the Secession war (several shocks) never lifting entirely
                since—but leaving mentality unimpaired absolutely (thank God!) I have a few,
                very few, staunch &amp; loving friends &amp; upholders here in America. I am
                gathering a lot of pieces—uttered within the last six years &amp; shall send
                them out under the name of <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi> before
                long—a little book (200 pages or less) some new pieces—a sort of
                continuation or supplement. Then I think of printing a revised ed'n of complete
                writings (<hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Specimen Days
                    &amp; Collect</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi> all in one
                volume) soon. Please accept <hi rend="italic">personal thanks</hi> from me (never mind the literary) &amp;
                I know you will accept the impromptu Note in the same spirit in wh' it is written.
                Best thanks and love to all my British helpers, readers &amp; defenders.</p>
