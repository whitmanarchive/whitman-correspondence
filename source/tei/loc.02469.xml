            </opener>
            <p>Two post cards from you<ptr target="loc.02469_n1"/> and a letter from 
                Warry,<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> by one mail made me a proudly happy man yesterday!</p>
            <p>My heart's best thanks to you for them as for all the manifold kindnesses you are
                continually heaping upon J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> and myself!</p>
            <p>Surely never were two more fortunate <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02469.002.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> friends than we! We daily congratulate ourselves upon our good
                fortune in being honoured with <hi rend="underline">your</hi> personal friendship &#38; upon receiving such
                frequent proofs of your great &#38; enduring love&#8212;"the measureless ocean of
                love within" you which you have so "freely poured forth" upon <hi rend="underline"
                    >us</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02469_n4"/></p>
            <p>Heaven's best blessing upon you, great-hearted Lover &#38; Benefactor!</p>
            <p>We had hoped for better reports concerning you than those contained in your kind <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02469.003.jpg" type="recto"/> p.c., as well as in
                Warry's letter to me &#38; H.L.T.'s<ptr target="n4267"/> to J.W.W., but we are
                grateful for the small mercy of "a suspicion of a shade of betterment" of which you
                speak &#38; we devoutly trust that by this time the dark cloud has <choice>

                </choice> its silver lining.</p>
            <p>Warry's letter was a "real nice" one&#8212;full of domestic details which I value
                very highly. It also reveals your "sailor-boy's" tenderly sympathetic heart &#38;
                the genuine affection he has for you.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02469.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I have just read Mrs M.L. Rayne's<ptr target="loc.02469_n2"/> article upon you in the

                your work; while the accompanying portrait is a downright libel upon you. It is
                evidently a copy&#8212;&#38; a very poor one&#8212;of one of "those smart,
                professional, foxy prints" which you do not like.<ptr target="loc.02469_n5"/></p>
            <p>As soon as your <hi rend="underline">2nd Annex</hi><ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> is published <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02469.005.jpg" type="recto"/> we must get the 1890
                picture out; but seeing that it will be one of the attractions of the book we deem
                it best to withhold it till after its publication there &#38; I thank you cordially
                for your kind permission to "give it out as I like."</p>

            <p>It is remarkable how much <hi rend="underline">en evidence</hi> you have been of
                late. You are no longer "rejected of the great magazines" as you were &#38; we now
                see the beginnings of that universal recognition which will surely be yours one
                day.</p>

            <p>The first day of Spring! Morning magnificent&#8212;Easterly wind, bright sunshine,
                &#38; blue sky with white clouds.</p>
            <p>Afternoon sun clouded over. Have just returned (7 pm) from short visit to J.W.W. at
                Anderton. He shewed me his highly-prized copy of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi>
                &#38; read me the last poem in it&#8212;"Great Are the Myths"<ptr
                    target="loc.02469_n7"/>&#8212;which you have omitted from your later

            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02469.008.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>We then went for a delightful walk in Rivington, round by the lake, &#38; much did I
                enjoy the air&#8212;so fresh &#38; invigorating after the town&#8212;the peaceful
                serenity that broods over the landscape, the beautiful scenery and my dear friends'
                sympathetic companionship. As we walked we talked much &#38; lovingly of you dear
                Master.</p> 
            <p>I picked up a few harbingers of spring&#8212;a bit of yellow gorse, a twig of
                "palms"&#8212;tomorrow is "palm sunday"&#8212;&#38; a coltsfoot flower&#8212;wh I
                enclose w the <hi rend="underline">Detroit Free Press</hi>.</p>
