                <salute>Dear Mr. Rossetti,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of last summer to William O'Connor<ptr target="upa.00097_n1"/> with the passages transcribed from a lady's correspondence have been shown
                me by him, and a copy lately furnished me, which I have just been re-reading. I am
                deeply touched by these sympathies &amp; convictions coming from a woman, &amp; from
                England, &amp; am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to
                get them, she would not only pardon you for transmitting them to Mr. O'Connor, but
                approve that action.<ptr target="upa.00097_n2"/> I realize indeed of such an
                emphatic &amp; smiling <hi rend="italic">Well done</hi> from the heart &amp;
                conscience of a true wife &amp; mother, &amp; one too whose sense of the poetic, as
                I glean from your letter, after flowing through the heart &amp; conscience, also
                comes through &amp; must satisfy Science, as much as the esthetic, that I had
                hitherto received no eulogium so magnificent.<ptr target="upa.00097_n3"/>
            </p>

            <p>I send by same mail with this, same address as this letter, two photographs, taken
                within a few months. One is intended for the lady (if I may be permitted to send it
                her)—and will you please accept the other with my respects &amp; love? The
                picture is by some criticized very severely indeed, but I hope you will not dislike
                it, for I confess myself to a (perhaps capricious) fondness for it as my own
                portrait over some scores that have been made or taken at one time or another.</p>

            <p>I am still at work in the Attorney General's office. My p. o. address remains the
                same, here. I am, &amp; have been, quite well &amp; hearty. My new editions,
                considerably expanded, with what suggestions &amp;c. I have to offer, presented, I
                hope, in more definite, graphic form, will probably get printed, the coming spring.
                I shall forward you early copies.</p>

            <p>I send my love to Moncure Conway,<ptr target="upa.00097_n4"/> if you see him. I wish he would
                write to me, soon &amp; fully. If the pictures don't reach you, or if they get
                injured on the way, I will try again by express. I wish you to read or loan this
                letter to the lady—or, if she wishes it, give it to her to keep.</p>
