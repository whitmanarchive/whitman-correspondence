                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I got the Camden paper this morning containing the notice of your mothers death. I
                had heard through Eldridge a few days ago that all was over with her. I suppose it
                was not unexpected to you yet for all that the blow must have been a heavy one to
                all her children and doubly so to yourself. I should like to hear from you the
                particulars of her last days. I wish I might have seen her again. If you are able to
                write <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01122.002.jpg" type="verso"/> do drop me a
                line &amp; tell me about yourself &amp; what your plans are for the summer. I hope
                you do not think of returning to W. before fall. I go to N. Y. to-morrow for a few
                days. While there a letter addressed to me care of George Bliss Jr. W. S. Atty,
                41 Chambers St. will reach me. If you can come North &amp; spend some time with me I
                should be delighted. I am going out on L. I. to look at a place for sale, Yaphank
                on <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#el" cert="low">Carmand</unclear> Ruin. Do you know the country out there?</p>
            <p>My nephew, Chancy B. is with me for a few days but leaves to-morrow; so does Sulic
                for Kingston. They both<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01122.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                speak affectionately of you &amp; are much concerned on your account.</p>
            <p>The lilacs are in their prime here, but the season is getting dry.</p>
