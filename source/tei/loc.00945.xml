               <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>I was at the Boat at 2 Wednesday afternoon and we sailed at 5.<ptr target="loc.00945_n100"/> I
<hi rend="italic">hoped</hi>
to see you, but feared you would not be able to go over. I was all the more sorry
<hi rend="italic">not</hi>
to see you, and I inferred from it that you were too unwell to come over. Mr. Conway, Martin, F.<ptr target="loc.00945_n2"/> went to the boat with me &amp; remained an hour or so. Mr. Howells<ptr target="loc.00945_n3"/> having business here, made his arrangements <pb facs="loc.00945.002.jpg" type="verso"/>to come that evening, so I had company, but I had
<hi rend="italic">hoped</hi>
for a good long talk with
<hi rend="italic">you,</hi>
&amp; hoped that you would be able to go over to the boat.</p>
            <p>How are you now, dear Walt?</p>
            <p>I long to hear from you. William &amp; Charlie<ptr target="loc.00945_n4"/> had each had two letters from you, &amp;
<hi rend="italic">I not a word,</hi>
don't you know that I shall be jealous? and now this is my
<hi rend="italic">third</hi>
epistle to you, so I shall claim a word from you
<hi rend="italic">when</hi>
you are able to write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="loc.00945.003.jpg" type="recto"/>My sister &amp; Dr. Channing<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> both ask for you with the greatest interest, &amp; Jeannie<ptr target="loc.00945_n6"/>, Mrs. C. says she should have written you
<hi rend="italic">at once</hi>
and asked you there when I first wrote her that you were ill, if she had not been sick herself.</p>
            <p>Should you write me, direct to me
<hi rend="italic">Care of Dr. Wm. F. Channing. Providence. R.I.</hi>
