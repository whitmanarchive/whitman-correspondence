                <salute>My dear Mr Whitman</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your kind package of photos just received they were quite a long time on road
             I was delighted I assure you to get them and they occupy the foremost place in my picture
                gallery—</p>
            <p>I send you by this same mail a few photographs that I had obtained. They are not very good but I
                thought that they might give you an idea of the country—</p>
            <p>I have been hoping to go East the end of the year so that I could see once more—some of the old
                familiar faces—but I seem to be hoping against fate—as the manager here will not accept
                my resignation, but wants me to agree to stay another year instead—&amp; am afraid that I will have to do
                so. While I appreciate his valuation of my services I would prefer to go East—but have been
                treated too kindly here to go against the wishes of the Company—</p>
            <p>Everything here is still green—&amp; oranges, lemons &amp; bananas—are very 
               plentiful I wish that I could only send you some—as I know that you would 
               enjoy them so much—&amp; we have
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01570_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                so many—I have just come from a trip to one of the mining properties belonging to this Company—situated
                some forty miles off through a most picturesquely wild country that I ever saw—the mine is
                situated at the bottom of a cañon running from fifty to two hundred feet deep by forty-five
                to fifty feet wide, &amp; the only access to it is down a notched stick for fifty feet till you
                strike a narrow ledge of rock hung over an immense waterfall &amp; along that slender ledge
                you have to lower yourself by aid of ropes. I have been through it once but not for all the 
                mines in Mexico would I go down it again—Life is too short &amp; sweet to attempt it a second time. Mexico is improving greatly foreign
                capital is coming in daily—mines are being opened—the value of Mexican dollars is higher
                than it has been for a long time &amp; a general feeling of better times prevails—as the mail is going out &amp; as our 
                mails here here are so uncertain. I will have to send this off hoping
                you will pardon the short letter, but I did not want anytime to pass before I acknowledge
                yr photographs so kindly sent—so acknowledge them by this same mail that they came in on</p>
            <p>Hoping that every day will bring you
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01571_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                improved health &amp; strength—is the sincere wish of
            </p>
