                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>    
            </opener>
            <p>Your letter was very welcome to me.<ptr target="yal.00291_n2"/> Your hand-write looks
                as clear &amp; strong as ever. I hope it really denotes that you are much better.
                The other night I read a long time in your "Specimen Days"<ptr target="n4121"/> &amp; got myself into a
                very melancholy state of mind thinking of the old times, of all that Washington life
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal.00291.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of
                    O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> &amp; of that which never can come back. My life
                now seems very pale &amp; poor compared with those days. There are but two things
                now from which I derive any satisfaction, Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> &amp;
                that bit of land up there on the river bank where I indulge my inherited love for
                the soil. I have no comrades here. I probably never shall find any more. Julian is
                developing into a very happy, intelligent boy, full of enthusiasms, full of
                curiosity, &amp; is about my only companion. He goes to school <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="yal.00291.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> here &amp; carries himself
                well.</p>
            <p>I am greatly distressed at what you tell me about O'Connor, and one must stand by
                powerless to render any aid! I hope I can see my way to go to W<ptr target="yal.00291_n3"/> again to see
                him.</p>
            <p>I shall not stay here in P. much longer. I am getting enough of boarding house life.
                I shall go back home by March, but Mrs B<ptr target="n0892"/> &amp; Julian will stay
                here. I had a letter from Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> this morning. The book may be
                sent to me at West Park, &amp; let me thank you in advance for it. Tell Horace the
                essays I am thinking of putting in a vol. <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="yal.00291.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> are old ones that have appeared in
                the magazines from time to time. What of Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/>? When you
                write again tell me what you know of his doings. Bright days here &amp; sharp, with
                ice boating in the river.</p>
