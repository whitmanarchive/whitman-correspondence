                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Do your remember how I visited you in Camden one day last June? Perhaps you will remember me by the bouquet of ferns and
                larkspurs. Now I am out here, and circumstances contrary to my wishes, will keep me
                here indefinitely.</p>
            <p>This is one of my homesick days, and I have been thinking over what there is in the
                north that I would so much like to see, and hear, <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03212.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> and among other things I think how
                much I would like to see you again, and hear you say, as you did before, "I'm glad
                you came!" I often think about you, and you have written so many lines for me that I
                wish to say a word back.</p>
            <p>When I read I say "Yes, I am she, O you wise poet," and sometimes I think I must
                put out my hand for you; and I am sure that we have gone together down that brown
                road a great many times; and perhaps it was my pulse that you heard, like "little
                tinkling bells."<ptr target="loc.03212_n2"/> </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03212.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I am very glad my eyes found the message you hid away for me&#8212;hid so deeply,
                though, that I barely found it, and at first doubted if there was a message there,
                or if it was for me.</p>
            <p>I love you very much, and feel toward you, as toward all strong and true people, a
                sense of obligation.</p> 
            <p>In glad acknowledgement of your companionship, and hoping for you all good things,</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Your friend,</salute>
                <signed>Eleanor M. Lawney.</signed>
