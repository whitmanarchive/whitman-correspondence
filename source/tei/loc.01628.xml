                <salute>Dear Pete</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>You will be surprised to get a letter from me away off here&#8212;I have been taking
                quite a journey the last two months&#8212;have been out to the Rocky Mountains and
                Colorado (2000 miles)&#8212;(Seems to me I sent you a paper six weeks ago from
                Denver)&#8212;I got along very well till about three weeks ago when I was taken sick
                &#38; disabled, &#38; hauled in here in St Louis for repairs, have been here ever
                since&#8212;am fixed comfortable&#8212;Still somewhat under the weather, (but have
                no doubt I shall be well as usual for me before long)&#8212;Shall stay here probably
                two or three weeks longer, &#38; then back east to Camden&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01628.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Pete this is a wonderful country out here, &#38; no one knows how big it is till he
                launches out in the midst of it&#8212;But there are plenty of hard-up fellows in
                this city &#38; out in the mines, &#38; all over here&#8212;you have no idea how
                many run ashore, get sick from exposure, poor grub &#38;c&#8212;many young men, some
                old chaps, some boys of 15 or 16&#8212;I met them every where, especially at the RR
                stoppings, out of money &#38; trying to get home&#8212;But the general run of all
                these Western places, city &#38; country is very prosperous, on the rush, plenty of
                people, plenty to eat, &#38; apparently plenty of money&#8212;Colorado you know is
                getting to be the great silver land of the world&#8212;In Denver I visited a big
                smelting establishment, purifying the ore, goes through many processes<ptr
                    target="loc.01628_n1"/>&#8212;takes a week&#8212;well they showed me silver
                there by the cart load&#8212;Then in middle Colorado, in one place, as we stopt in a
                mining camp I saw rough bullion bars piled up in stacks outdoors five <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01628.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> or six feet high
                like hay cocks&#8212;</p>

            <p>&#8212;So it is&#8212;a few make great strikes&#8212;like the prizes in the
                lottery&#8212;but most are <hi rend="underline">blanks</hi>&#8212;I was at Pike's
                Peak&#8212;I liked Denver City very much&#8212;But the most interesting part of my
                travel has been <hi rend="underline">the Plains</hi>, (the great American <hi
                    rend="underline">Desert</hi> the old geographies call it, but it is no desert)
                largely through Colorado &#38; Western Kansas, all flat, hundreds &#38; even
                thousands of miles&#8212;some real good, nearly all pretty fair soil, all for stock
                raising, thousands of herds of cattle, some very large&#8212;the herdsmen, (the
                principal common employment) a wild hardy race, always on horseback, they call 'em
                    <hi rend="underline">cow-boys</hi> altogether&#8212;I used to like to get among
                them &#38; talk with them&#8212;I stopt some days at a town right in the middle of
                those Plains, in Kansas, on the Santa Fe road&#8212;found a soldier<ptr
                    target="loc.01628_n2"/> there who had known me in the war 15 years ago&#8212;was
                married &#38; running the hotel there&#8212;I had hard work to get away from
                him&#8212;he wanted me to stay all winter&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01628.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>The picture at the beginning of this letter is the St Louis bridge over the
                Mississippi river<ptr target="loc.01628_n3"/>&#8212;I often go down to the river, or
                across this bridge&#8212;it is one of my favorite sights&#8212;but the air of this
                city don't agree with me&#8212;I have not had a well day, (even for me,) since I
                have been here&#8212;</p>

            <p>&#8212;Well Pete dear boy I guess I have written enough&#8212;How are you getting along?
                I often think of you &#38; no doubt you often do of me&#8212;God bless you, my
                darling friend, &#38; however it goes, you must try to keep up a good
                heart&#8212;for I do&#8212;</p>
