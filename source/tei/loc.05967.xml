            <p>
                Your kind note of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> is
                received also the package&#8212;&amp;
                "Leaves of Grass"&#8212;both of which
                are to me more precious
                than gold. I sent you
                yesterday a copy of my paper
                containing the lecture Keep
                off the Grass. As it may be
                withheld by the P O. Officials
                I send you one to day enclosed
                in a new book that I have
                just published. The whole
                edition of my paper is still held
                at the Post Office awaiting
                decision from Washington as to
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jp.00184_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                its alleged indecency
                by <choice><abbr>PM</abbr><expan>Postmaster</expan></choice>. Tobey. As in
                my next number I shall
                have the whole history of
                this infamous impertinence
                and audacity in print
                I will not weary you with
                writing it here&#8212;. I have
                received a very kind note
                from Mr O'Connor from
                whose splendid article I 
                quoted&#8212;containing the offer
                of his kind offices at
                Washington. As I cannot
                think there can be another
                edition-of-such-holy impurity
                and-insensibility to all the 
                sacred rights of man as
                Tobey I hope soon to
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jp.00183_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                have it in circulation
                I have a circulation of 2600&#8212;scattered all over the Union&#8212;Canada&#8212;&amp; a few of them
                in England Scotland France
                Switzerland Italy Australia
                New Zealand &amp; the West Indies
                among whom you have many ardent admirers&#8212;When I first
                lectured from Leaves of Grass
                I received many expressions of
                gratitude from them&#8212;I am sorry that last Winter
                I allowed a press of business
                to lead me to postpone calling
                on you until I found that
                it was too late&#8212;. I am 
                however loath to intrude my
                self on public personages&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf002vr" facs="loc_jp.00185_large.jpg" type="verso"/>as I know that much of their 
                valuable time is thus wasted.&#8212;I shall however always feel
                as though I have touched your
                soul &amp; felt the beating of
                your heart near to mine
                in the few kind words
                you have sent me&#8212;and whenever
                I read Leaves of Grass
                your personal inscription on the
                fly leaf&#8212;will make every
                line fragrant with your love.
