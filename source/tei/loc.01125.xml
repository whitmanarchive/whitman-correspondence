                matter how much of an effort it cost you to make the start. I happened to get Saturdays Tribune &amp; saw

                &amp; contains some of the best things about you that have yet been in print. I am rejoiced that you are 
                as well as this indicates. I do not like the title of the new book as well as the one you proposed 
                last spring&#8212;namely "Songs &amp; pieces Leftover" This sounds like you, the other does not. 
                We have had a very dry season here till just now. My berry crop &amp; other crops were 
                much injured.</p>

                read several of the Chapters. For some reason it does not strike me. It does not very differ much from 
                the rest of the critical literature of that subject. I  do not yet see that it throws any new light.

                His Victor Hugo<ptr target="n4276"/> article, strikes me as much more masterly.</p>
            <p>Have you ever heard of this new medical idea called the "Compound oxygen Treatment"?

                I would strongly urge you to try it. Our attention has been called

                She was threatened with some serious lung difficulty &amp; was treated by Starkey who was then in

                He helped or Cured her lung trouble &amp; his oxygen so vivified &amp; re-kindled her vital energies that
                she got with child forth with&#8212;after being married 9 years. I think I shall send my wife down 
                there this winter; in the mean time I wish you would look into it. It looks as if oxygen
