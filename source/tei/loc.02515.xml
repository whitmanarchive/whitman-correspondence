            <p>I am indeed glad to know that things, on the whole, go on fairly well with you
                &#38; that you are able to sleep better &#38; to be up, take your food &#38; stand your

                &#38; steam can take him.</p> 
            <p>In your letter you say that your "missives are probably monotonous enough,
                the same old story over &#38; over again."</p>
            <p>Ah my dear, good old Friend if you knew how I long for those dear missives, how s[w]eetly

                precious &#38; how prized they are you would not speak of monotony.
                To me they are as welcome as the flowers in spring &#38; I dare not think
                of the time when I shall cease to receive them.</p>
            <p>I am deeply touched by your reference to your "fast dimming" eyesight
                &#38; by the thought that you should continue to write to me when I know
                that the effort must be considerable. God bless you continually &#38; preserve
                you from disaster for many a long day to come!</p>

                our meeting on Monday last&#8212;wh. was held here&#8212;we spent the time
                in reading over our Whitman Correspondence&#8212;including H.L.T's<ptr target="n4267"/>
                wonderfully sweet &#38; precious letters&#8212;in loving talk about you

                e.g. "Out of the rolling ocean"<ptr target="loc.02515_n6"/> &#38;c &#38;c.</p>
            <p>By the time you receive this Wallace will have seen &#38; held loving converse

                But I have had my innings &#38; now he is having his. But all the same I say
                "Happy fellow!"</p>
            <p>I am a little impatient of the long time that must elapse before I can hear
                from him about his visit to you as I do so long to hear his story. But I must
                possess my soul in patience &#38; in due time all will come right</p>
            <p>I enclose a cutting from "The Queen"<ptr target="loc.02515_n7"/> of June 13/91<ptr target="loc.02515_n2"/> which will certainly amuse you.</p>

                                and Mr Whitman sat in a little summer-house receiving callers nearly all day. The arbour was filled with flowers before dusk.
                                The "good grey poet," though not able to get about very briskly, is in good health and spirits. The old gentleman entertained his guests
                                with selections from his own works. From time to time, as groups gathered, he would open a volume, and eyeing his audience critically,
                                select a passage which he believed would please them. Letters of congratulation were received from Lord Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/>
