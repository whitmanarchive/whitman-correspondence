            <p> I dont seem to have heard from you for a long while. In a
                letter I had from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">d</hi></hi><ptr target="loc.02189_n3"/>&#8212;she
                mentioned that you were prevented from coming to Glendale the day fixed but <choice><abbr>w<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">ld</hi></hi></abbr><expan>would</expan></choice> come the following. How I should like to see you all again&#8212;the first
                picture that I sell for a decent sum I shall come&#8212;Just now I was engaged upon
                a picture of "Juliet" life size, "Juliet comes over the balcony and takes her last look at her husband," Oh
                God, I have an ill divining soul".... I believe that the picture will make my name
                as an artist, a few months will show! </p>

                pretty hard of late, something about you, sent it to the Nineteenth Century. An article of hers is coming out in the November Blackwood
                "Three Glimpses of a New England Village: editor kept it a year so it was a very
                pleasant surprize to all of us&#8212;its acceptance. </p>
            <p> You dont seem to have been busy with your pen this summer. You must come over and
                draw a final inspiration from dear grimy, glorious, immense old London. Fleet Street will give you a
                new sensation I warrant you, if you want one, that is; for there is only one London
                all foreigners friendly and otherwise are agreed upon that; there <pb

                cities but there are none the least like it. Your poems are gaining ground a little
                here I think; sort of standard works... We have had a smart skirmish with our
                publisher. Made him jump I fancy&#8212;but they&#8212;publishers&#8212;are a damned
                set of thieves. </p>
            <p> Dined out in Hampstead the other night with young Bigelow&#8212;the exministers
                son&#8212;of the dashing fashionable order; with more aplomb than most New Yorkers.
                Young B. is rather anti democratic I should fear, remarked that Mathew Arnold was
                not a gentleman, on being asked why&#8212;because he dined out in Chicago in a shooting jacket. </p>

                with us a few weeks since, nice
                genuine people: homely, but homliness illumined with depth of feeling and sincerity
                of aim, altogether a remarkable and interesting Philadelphian. </p>
