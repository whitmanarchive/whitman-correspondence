            <p>I will write you a few lines without any thing to say, but because the spirit moves
                me &amp; every thing is so beautiful &amp; peaceful in the nearly declined but
                dazzling sun—The little children are playing out on the walks, a mocking-bird
                is singing over the way, &amp; a young just-bursting magnolia blossom, (sent me an
                hour ago by the grocery woman at the corner) fills the room
                with its spicy fragrance, from its glass of water on the window-sill—I have
                been somewhat under a cloud physically the last week, but feel better to
                day—&amp; the best of it is a sort of consciousness (if it don't deceive me)
                of being better for good—at any rate for the time, wh.<expan>ich</expan> is as much as could be
                asked for—</p>
		<p>I have written &amp; sent a poem to <hi rend="underline">Lippincotts</hi>—wh. has been accepted, &amp; I have got the money for it, 
		(&amp; great good it does me, coming now)—Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is here—he is drawing &amp; painting my portrait to-day—Sidney Morse<ptr target="n0862"/> has modelled a 
large (colossal I suppose) head of me—I think perhaps the best thing yet—Love to your father, yourself &amp; Alys,<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> the baby dear, &amp; all—as I end, after my supper, 
(mostly strawberries) I see glimpses of a fine sunset in the west &amp; the boys out in Mickle Street are playing base ball—</p>
