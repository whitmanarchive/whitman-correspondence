            <p>I will write you a few lines without any thing to say, but because the spirit moves
                me &#38; every thing is so beautiful &#38; peaceful in the nearly declined but
                dazzling sun&#8212;The little children are playing out on the walks, a mocking-bird
                is singing over the way, &#38; a young just-bursting magnolia blossom, (sent me an
                hour ago by the grocery woman at the corner) fills the room
                with its spicy fragrance, from its glass of water on the window-sill&#8212;I have
                been somewhat under a cloud physically the last week, but feel better to
                day&#8212;&#38; the best of it is a sort of consciousness (if it don't deceive me)
                of being better for good&#8212;at any rate for the time, wh.<expan>ich</expan> is as much as could be
                asked for&#8212;</p>
		<p>I have written &#38; sent a poem to <hi rend= "underline">Lippincotts</hi>&#8212;wh. has been accepted, &#38; I have got the money for it, 
		(&#38; great good it does me, coming now)&#8212;Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is here&#8212;he is drawing &#38; painting my portrait to-day&#8212;Sidney Morse<ptr target="n0862"/> has modelled a 
large (colossal I suppose) head of me&#8212;I think perhaps the best thing yet&#8212;Love to your father, yourself &#38; Alys,<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> the baby dear, &#38; all&#8212;as I end, after my supper, 
(mostly strawberries) I see glimpses of a fine sunset in the west &#38; the boys out in Mickle Street are playing base ball&#8212;</p>
