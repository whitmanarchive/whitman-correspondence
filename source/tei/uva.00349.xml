            </opener>
            <p>I got Jeff's letter sending the money toward the soldiers' dinner&#8212;it was more than I asked for, &amp; was very good of them all<ptr target="uva.00349_n1"/>&#8212;I have not had any trouble myself, worth mentioning&#8212;the dinner has been got up at my instigation&#8212;I have contributed handsomely&#8212;but they, (the Hospital steward, &amp;c.) have done the work.</p>
            <p>Mother, I sent Han a handsome little volume of "Florence Percy's Poems,"<ptr target="uva.00349_n2"/> &amp; $5 for a Christmas present. Sent it to-day. Poor Han&#8212;I suppose every such thing does her so much good&#8212;</p>
            <p>Don't you believe that fool Heyde lately wrote a long letter to Mr. Raymond,<ptr target="uva.00349_n3"/> editor of the N. Y. Times&#8212;in it he said "Walt was a good fellow <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">but</hi>"&#8212;&amp; then he went on to run down Leaves of Grass, like the rest of 'em&#8212;</p>
            <p>The way I know is, Wm. O'Connor was invited by Raymond to come &amp; see him&#8212;&amp; he told O'Connor he had received a number of letters about that piece in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Dec. 2, which I sent you. He said they all praised the piece, &amp; thanked him (Raymond) for printing it, except one he got from a fellow in Vermont who called himself Walt Whitman's relation&#8212;a brother in law, he believed&#8212;quite a good deal of stuff. Raymond seemed to think the man was either crazy or a fool, &amp; he treated the letter with contempt.</p>
            <p>I dont want you to write any thing about it, to Han, of course&#8212;only if she was here, we would tell her. The puppy thought I suppose that he could get his letter printed, &amp; injure me &amp; my book.</p>
            <p>We are likely to have a pleasant day for Christmas&#8212;when I next write I will tell you about the dinner&#8212;I must inform you that I have had a present of a beautiful knife, a real Rogers' steel, to-day from the Attorney General&#8212;Mother, $2 is for Nance<ptr target="uva.00349_n4"/>&#8212;you can give it to her in money, or any way you like&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, dear mother, this is Christmas eve, &amp; I am writing it in the office by gas light, so as it will be ready to go to-morrow&#8212;I have not heard since from Mrs. Grayson. Good night, mother dear.</p>
