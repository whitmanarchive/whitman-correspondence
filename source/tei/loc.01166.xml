                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I am sitting here in my bark-covered study this bright sharp day, writing you this
                note. I look from the open fire that burns in the chimney, &amp; the wood of which I
                cut &amp; hauled up the hill myself, out of the window on to the river just covered
                with new ice, on off over the brown gray landscape. I am feeling well, better than
                one year <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01166.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> ago
                this time, my summers work I think has put something into me I much needed. I am
                still busy nearly every day in the open air. There is no snow &#38; the ground for the
                past few days has been like iron. As soon as the snow comes we shall probably go to
                Po'Keepsie to board a while. Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> says he rather stay here, &amp; he likes the
                country, &amp; likes the school here. He learns well &amp; begins to read books on
                his own hook. The other
                day at the close of the term of school he read his first composition in public. It
                was a real piece. <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01166.003_large.jpg" type="recto"
                /> It was about "Papas Dogs" &amp; gave much amusement. He spoke a couple of pieces
                also, &amp; easily carried off the honors. He is now reading "Tom Brown at Rugby."<ptr target="loc.01166_n1"/> I
                trust, dear Walt, you are better than when you wrote a couple of weeks ago, &amp;
                that you will have a fairly good Christmas. If you are not in the mood to write me
                yourself ask Horace <choice><orig>Trauble</orig> <reg>Traubel</reg></choice><ptr target="n4267"/> to drop me a 
                card. Nothing notable comes to or happens to me. I read a
                little, write none at all, go nowhere, &amp; try to make the most of the <unclear
                    reason="illegible" resp="#rf" cert="low">prose</unclear> of life. If I could
                only continue my farm work or else hibernate like a woodchuck <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01166.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I should be glad. If you have any
                late news from O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> please let me have it. With much love
                &amp; a merry Christmas to you I am</p>
