            <p>I sent you a postal card from <choice><abbr>N Y</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice> &#38; a paper with an acc't of the Bryant funeral, which I suppose you rec'd<ptr target="upa.00173_n1"/>&#8212;I came up here last Thursday afternoon, in a fine steamboat<ptr target="upa.00173_n2"/>&#8212;had a delightful journey&#8212;a fine day &#38; everything to interest me&#8212;the constantly changing but ever-beautiful panorama on both sides of the river all the way, (nearly 100 miles up here)&#8212;the magnificent north river bay part of the city&#8212;the high straight walls of the rocky Palisades&#8212;the never ending hills&#8212;beautiful Yonkers&#8212;the endless succession of handsome villages &#38; cities&#8212;the prevailing green&#8212;the great rocky mountains, gray &#38; brown&#8212;the river itself, now expanding, now narrowing&#8212;the glistening river with continual sloops, yachts, &#38;c. their white sails singly or in fleets, some near, some in the distance&#8212;the numberless elegant mansions in spots peeping through the woods, or perch'd somewhere back on the hills&#8212;&#38;c &#38;c &#38;c&#8212;&#38; here I am&#8212;this is now the fourth day, having a good time&#8212;Mr Burroughs &#38; his wife are as kind as they can be&#8212;We have plenty of strawberries, cream, &#38;c. and something I specially like, namely plenty of sugared raspberries &#38; currants mixed together (I go out &#38; pick the currants myself, great red things, bushels of them going to waste)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Albert Johnston, (the gentleman's son, at whose house I am staying in N Y) is here too on a visit to the Burroughs's&#8212;makes it more agreeable<ptr target="upa.00173_n3"/>&#8212;Yesterday we all (Mr B, Al, &#38; I) went out on a long drive&#8212;I took in every thing&#8212;the old stone fences two feet thick&#8212;the peculiar scenery, hilly &#38; broken &#38; rocky&#8212;the long rows of splendid locust trees&#8212;the "balm of Gilead" perfuming the road&#8212;the streams down the mountains, with waterfalls&#8212;"Black Creek" brawling along&#8212;the Cattskills in the distance, with mist around their peaks&#8212;All did me good&#8212;It is lucky the roads are first [rate] here, (as they are) for it is either up or down hill constantly, &#38; often steep enough&#8212;We pass'd many <hi rend="italic">tramps</hi> on the road&#8212;this seems a great region for them&#8212;One squad specially interested me&#8212;it was a family of five (or six) in a smallish, flat, ricketty one-horse wagon, with a few poor household traps, &#38; some baskets (the folks were basket makers), in the midst of all of which were huddled two or three young children&#8212;On a low board in front of the wagon, the man (gaunt dirty middle aged) was driving&#8212;the woman by his side, thin &#38; sickly, &#38; a little babe wrapt in a bundle on her lap, its little red feet &#38; legs sticking out toward us as we passed&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>On our return at sundown we met them again&#8212;they had hauled aside at a lonesome spot near the woods evidently to camp for the night&#8212;the horse was unhitched &#38; taken out, &#38; was grazing peacefully near by&#8212;the man was busy at the wagon with something&#8212;the little boy had gather'd a lot of dry wood &#38; was building a fire on the open ground&#8212;&#38; as we went on a little on the road we encounter'd the woman still carrying her baby, &#38; a pretty-eyed 6 year old girl trotting barefoot behind, clutching her by the gown&#8212;the woman was carrying two or three baskets (she had doubtless been on to the neighboring houses to sell, &#38; was now returning)&#8212;We stopt &#38; spoke to her &#38; bought a basket&#8212;She didn't look up at all out of the recesses of her old sunbonnet&#8212;her voice, manner, seem'd so queer, terrified&#8212;then as we went on Al stopt the wagon, &#38; ran back to the group to buy another basket&#8212;he caught a look of the woman's face, &#38; talk'd with her a little&#8212;says she was young, but seem'd more like an animated corpse than any thing else&#8212;poor woman&#8212;what was her story?<ptr target="upa.00173_n4"/></p>

            <p>Shall go back to New York to-morrow afternoon&#8212;will finish my letter there&#8212;To-day, Sunday (now 11&#189; a m) Mrs B[urroughs] has driven to church&#8212;Mr B is off somewhere&#8212;Al ditto&#8212;I seem to be alone in the house, every thing quiet, only natural sounds, birds, &#38;c. for nearly an hour&#8212;a beautiful expanded view from the large open windows as I write&#8212;Before Mr B went out I told him I was going to write to you&#8212;He told me to send you &#38; all his love, &#38; say he got Herbert's letter yesterday&#8212;</p>
