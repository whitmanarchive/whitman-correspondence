            <p>I am pretty fair in health &amp;c of late &amp; now—pleasant weather here for
                several weeks—rainy of late—Y'r nice letter from Switzerland came
                yesterday—one from your father also just rec'd, enclosing the J A Symonds'<ptr target="n0615"/> note in answer to Swinburne's<ptr target="n0610"/>
                article—(the article was not worth answering at all—I have not given it
                a thought)—</p>
            <p>Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> has been here for five or six days—leaves
                to-night—he is well—hearty as ever &amp; much the same—he has (in
                London Canada) one of the plaster heads<ptr target="loc.01365_n2"/>, &amp; is quite enthusiastic ab't it—I
                suppose the one I sent to y'r father has been rec'd before this—I think it had
                better be donated to the Kensington Museum, if they will accept it &amp; give it a
                fair place—Morse<ptr target="n0862"/> is still here (in Phila)—is at work on his statuette
                of President Cleveland—H Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> is here—he is
                at this moment giving some final touches on his oil painting of me—I like
                it—Some think it too <hi rend="underline">tame</hi>—you will doubtless
                see it, as G. leaves here (NY) on the 21st on the Germania—</p>
            <p>Phila is all agog now &amp; for three days to come with the centennial of the
                Constitution (the idea is good, perhaps sublime, but the carrying out of it more or
                less tawdry &amp; vulgar)—I am sitting here in the great chair, down
                stairs—window open—big bunches of flowers on the sill—every thing
                all right—had toast &amp; a great mug of Whitman's chocolate &amp; hot milk
                (excellent) for my breakfast—Love to Alys<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/>, to the
                baby,<ptr target="n3137"/> &amp; to all—</p>
