            <p>Yours of 12th <choice>
                    <orig>rec'd</orig><reg>received</reg></choice>, &#38; much welcomed&#8212;As I write the day is just closing &#38; dark &#38; the rain has
                been falling heavy &#38; steady for hours&#8212;makes an undertone &#38; music for
                me on the tin roof overhead&#8212;I have been moderately busy for some time past
                &#38; to day writing&#8212;pieces I get fair pay for from the magazines&#8212;the
                more necessary now as quite a set-back &#38; very bad piece of luck has happened to
                me in my new Boston book&#8212;but it would be quite a complicated story, &#38; I
                will tell you the particulars when I come down&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;Susan I am sorry to hear of Howard Browning's death<ptr target="loc.03909_n1"
                />&#8212;so young, &#38; with life &#38; pleasure all before him as it would
                seem&#8212;such things bring up thoughts in one's mind that no words or writing can
                describe&#8212;I wish Jo and Debby to see this letter&#8212;&#38; I send them my
                love&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;I suppose Harry is not home to-day it is so stormy&#8212;I have sent him bundles of
                papers<ptr target="loc.03909_n2"/>&#8212;They say the old <choice>

                </choice> road have bought the Narrow Gauge&#8212;will that affect Harry's position
                any?&#8212;I can fancy you all there in the house to-day, if it rains there any thing like
                it does here&#8212;George I dare say has gone up in his room &#38; is taking a good
                blessed sleep&#8212;I don't know what Ed
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00514_large.jpg" type="verso"/>would be doing, but I can fancy     
                Mont reading some of Mrs Holmes's<ptr target="loc.03909_n3"/> books &#38; perhaps
                Ruthey setting the table or frying something for supper&#8212;at any rate I hope you
                are all having a good time&#8212;&#38; if I had the magic carpet of the Arabian
                Nights, I should come down &#38; join your circle for a couple of hours, &#38; then
                whisk myself back here again by nine o'clock, in time to finish the piece I have
                under way&#8212;Tell Mrs Rogers I send my best respects&#8212;I remember with
                pleasure the nice visit &#38; dinner in Linden Street&#8212;I have not forgotten
                Jane either<ptr target="loc.03909_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Susan you speak of my not being well&#8212;somehow I seemed to have a real bad time,
                a mixture of troubles, neuralgia among the rest, for a month past,&#8212;but I think
                I have got over the worst for the present, &#38; for the last three or four days I
                feel about as usual&#8212;I went over a few days ago to a (Quaker) school in
                Philadelphia, where they teach well-grown children, <hi rend="underline">not</hi>
                lessons by rote, but all sorts of practical things, such as would be appropriate and
                interesting to the young, but leading the way to occupations, for both sexes,
                drawing, painting, the use of carpenters' tools, cooking, sewing, cutting out
                clothes, &#38;c. It was conducted by a gentleman and his niece, free&#8212;I tell
                you it opened my eyes to many new things&#8212;makes our ordinary schools
                ridiculous&#8212;Well, Susan, dear friend, I have filled out the sheet with writing,
                such as it is&#8212;I believe the first letter I have sent you now for a long
                time&#8212;God bless you &#38; all&#8212;</p>
