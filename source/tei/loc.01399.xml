            </opener>

            <p>Thy postal card of ten days ago has just came. It is so good of thee to write. I am
                ashamed when I think how long a silence I have kept&#8212;yet I have thought of thee
                very often I have been so busy&#8212;"facilis decensus"&#8212;into
                politics!&#8212;and when once there, it is hard to get out.<pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.01399.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> Of course the one miserable thing
                occupying the political field is Parnell's incredible meanness. He has dealt the
                death blow to Home Rule in this generation, I am afraid. I feel so sorry for the
                many Liberals whose one cry and interest has been Home Rule. It is not so unhappy
                for me, because for several years <hi rend="underline">all</hi> my work has been
                given to what seems to me infinitely more interesting than the machinery of
                politics&#8212;the reform of existing social abuses, such as the<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01399.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> overwork &amp;
                underpay &amp; the generally wretched conditions under which the poor live&#8212;The
                collapse of Home Rule will bring <hi rend="underline">these</hi> questions much more
                to the front, but I think it means a Liberal defeat at the next election, as the
                Party is not prepared.</p>

            <p>I feel quite in the vein of writing a volume of newspaper "leaders" on the subject,
                but I will refrain!</p>



            <p>We are all so well&#8212;children &amp; all. Ray<ptr target="n3137"/> goes to a
                    little<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01399.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Kindergarten school every day. Frank<ptr target="n3133"/> &amp; I are going to spend
                our Xmas holiday at Rome, if all goes well.</p>
            <p>Father<ptr target="n4979"/> is undergoing transformation into the "Country Squire" of
                fiction. He is wrapt up in "the place" at Haslemere, spends most of his time
                there.</p>
            <p>Many thanks for all the papers, which greet me from time to time with a sight of thy
                hand writing.</p>
