            <p>During my travels so far away from home; I have often thought of you and especially
                so when crossing the same territory that you at one time traversed.<ptr target="loc.03562_n2"/></p>

            <p>But you would scarcely know it now, in fact while now in the centre of the U.S. I
                enjoy the same elegant meals &#38; comforts that would surround me in your city
                &#38; how happy would I be could I now instead of writing you, just walk as once
                before into your grand presence &#38; explain the interesting parts of my</p>

            <p>late travels together with the immense success I am on all hands meeting with</p>

            <p>You I feel will be happy to learn of my success and which is added to occasionally
                (as while here) with an $800.00 order, I continue west to Denver &#38; Leadville and
                upon my return during the summer I ask again the pleasure of seeing you when I shall
                remember you with some thing from the great west in happy memory of your kind
                attention to me through Mr Wm Ingram<ptr target="n0323"/> who I write occasionally
                &#38; who kindly answers me &#38; assures me of your good health</p>

            <p>After my long confinement<ptr target="loc.03562_n3"/> which in my case &#38; very many others was a gross
                injustice upon free men I enjoy the varied &#38; grand sight now ever so much and
                while Beer &#38; music is yet one of my standards &#38; enjoyed by all the West We
                dont have to go to Prison three years for enjoying thence out here nor should we
                either in Philada[.] "That Dog Stokley"</p>

            <p>I could laugh while they were hanging the scoundrel while to you &#38; Mr Ingam I
                return my true &#38; sincere love&#8212;</p>
