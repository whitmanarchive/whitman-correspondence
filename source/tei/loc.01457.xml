            <p>I<ptr target="n0196"/> have mailed you and registered there, the following Books and
                printed matter. a Copy of "the Bhagavad Gita"<ptr target="n0079"/> Thompson's

                of Birkenhead (to whom I gave a copy of the Complete Edition of your Poems) lastly
                the Supplement to our town's paper. I would like you to look over a Sketch by H.C.
                Andersen on <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#km">two</unclear> Candles,
                its translated by one of your readers here. the other is a Story from Iceland being
                the first story in said paper, it is also written by a warm friend of yours, he was
                once Editor of the paper but is now engaged in a larger paper in a neighbouring
                town, a paper that is quite in advance of all our papers here about entitled the
                Newcastle Chronicle it has got a Daily as well as weekly issue. I will send you a
                copy someday of the weekly one so that you may gauge its power and its principles
                and also <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01457.004.jpg" type="verso"/> contrast it
                with your own papers for I think there is large room for improvement in—many
                of them I see. they seem to contain matters of such trivial interest outside of the
                district they are issued in. now I think your papers ought as a rule to be universal

                a little time pleasantly with him in London in 1873. He's a right noble free spoken
                man, full of wise helpful energy of all sorts in his neighborhood in London. I
                regretted his notes on you was so very brief. Will my subscription to your new
                Edition of your works, if sent you direct to America, be of any real aid in your new
                effort? let me know I will</p>
