            <p>Your postal just received,
                Glad you <choice><orig>coment</orig><reg>comment</reg></choice> that Grace shall go
                on with the Calendar.&#8212;They have not
                yet returned from their summer trip to
                Alaska.&#8212;Expect them about the 15th &#38;
                shall see them soon after they arrive&#8212;
            </p>
            <p>I have not heard from William direct
                since he want to Bar Harbor, but have a
                letter from Nelly this morning in which
                she says that the new farm is very
                favorable.&#8212;Dr Kinnear says he is 
                improving and William himself, who is not
                at all disposed to be sanguine on that point,
                also says the same.&#8212;He says that he wishes
                he had been fortunate enough to fall into
                Dr Kinnear's hands at first.&#8212;This is
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02025.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                very good news, and I know it will be very
                joyful tidings to you and all of William's
                friends&#8212;The summer months are 
                now over, and I can truly say that
                Los Angeles has the most perfect summer
                climate I have ever experienced&#8212;<hi rend="underline">If
                this is a specimen</hi>&#8212;no one would ever
                want to go away from here to escape the
                heat, rather stay to enjoy the ideal summer
                weather. Imagine a place where in the
                shade you are always comfortable&#8212;delicious sea breezes, in which you can smell
                the salt air, blow every afternoon (the ocean 
                is only 18 miles away) and the superb nights
                with their glorious pageantry of stars give 
                you the most refreshing sleep&#8212;always under 
                a blanket&#8212;I think that when this climate
                is truly known, as many people will come here
                from the East in the summer time to escape
                the torrid heat, as will come in the winter
                to avoid the Arctic cold.
            </p>
            <p>The markets here are now gorged
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02025.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
                with the most magnificent display of fruit
                you ever saw. The most attractive are
                perhaps the peaches, the plums and the grapes
                which excel any thing I have heretofore
                known both in size, beauty and lusciousness.
                The muscats (principal grape for raisins) the 
                Malagas, (also for raisins) both white. Then
                there are the Saint Peters, the Tokays and the
                Mission grape (used principally for wine)&#8212;the latter all purple&#8212;You can buy them
                at the fruit stands for 2 cents a pound&#8212;some
                times 6 lb for 10 cents.&#8212;Some of the clusters
                weigh <hi rend="underline">three pounds</hi> and more. They are a sight
                delightful to the eye.&#8212;There are also plenty of
                figs in market.&#8212;But I do not take much 
                to them in their natural state. This is also the 
                country of the olive, the pomegranate and the Almond.
                Large quantities of English walnuts are also raised.
                In the winter or early Spring the oranges and 
                lemons are gathered.&#8212;So you see this will
                be eventually the great fruit raising part of the U.S.
                No ports, no thunderstorms, no cyclones&#8212;

                But I have given you enough of Southern
                California for one time.&#8212;Always
                delighted to hear from you.&#8212;Send me a postal
                card when you can, and a letter when you
                have leisure &#38; feel like writing to your
                old comrade who is as ever.&#8212;
