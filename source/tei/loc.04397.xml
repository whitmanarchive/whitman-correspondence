                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>   
            </opener>  
                <p>I have not had any opportunity of writing to you since Wednesday morning, when I was at 
                Fenelon Falls.<ptr target="loc.04397_n2"/>—Immediately after dinner Tom Rutherford<ptr target="loc.04397_n1"/> came for me &amp; drove me out to his farm, 5
                miles out; where I stayed till the following afternoon. I enjoyed the visit immensely. Tom
                himself is a man well worth knowing &amp; we were soon great friends—(for
                Fred Wild's<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> sake as well as his own.) He is simply an average farmer—not educated—but a fine
                fellow in all the essential qualities of manhood, cute, intelligent, industrious, faithful, true, &amp;
                a warm-hearted friend, husband &amp; father. My friend Fred Wild thinks a
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00982_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                lot of him &amp; has kept up a steady correspondence with him for the last 17 years. And it was
                delightful to me to see how deep &amp; warm was the friendship on Tom's side.—And as
                I have heard so much of him for so many years, it was like meeting an old friend of my own.
                At any rate we are friends <hi rend="underline">now</hi>!</p> 
                <p>He farms 55 acres, which he has cleared himself. He has had a rough laborious life, but is doing well
                &amp; prospering—though slowly. It was a novel experience to me to see backwood's farming
                &amp; life, but I enjoyed it very much.—I liked too to get out into the "bush"—chipmunks
                calling &amp; playing about me—one little fellow descending a tree
                in front of me &amp; playing about for fully 5 minutes before running off amid the rustling leaves.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00983_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <p>The following afternoon Tom took me down to Sturgeon Point—2 miles away—where I took the steamer
                along Lake Sturgeon to <hi rend="underline">Bobcaygeon</hi>. I called on a friend of Fred Wild's
                there, &amp; stayed all night. Bobcaygeon is quite a pleasure resort during the season—people
                going there from Buffalo &amp; Rochester, &amp; even from Kansas (Indian name, meaning short, shallow
                rapids)—Took steamer back next morning (Friday) to Sturgeon Point &amp; up to Tom's. After dinner
                he drove me back to Fenelon Falls, where I caught the 4 o'clock train here—Tom
                seeing me off with moist eyes.</p>
                <p>Reached Haliburton @ 7 oclock. (It is the terminus north of the Grand Trunk Ry.) Was met by
                M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Stewart<ptr target="n5001"/> who drove me here. The house here is a boarding house during the season
                (now over) &amp; is beautifully situated at the end of a small lake—(one of a chain of
                lakes)—Haliburton being at the
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00984_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    other end.—M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Stewart<ptr target="loc.04397_n3"/> came out here 28 years ago—used to be a <choice><orig>journallist</orig><reg>journalist</reg></choice> in
                London—&amp; is Crown Land Agent here. He is a well read, clever &amp; entertaining
                man whom I heartily like. He has 11 children, nearly all married, &amp; has 3 or 4 sons 
                in the States (Is strongly in favor of Annexation).—Yesterday he took me in a boat to the second lake,
                7 miles from here, to visit a young farmer who is sick. I enjoyed it very much, the hills
                at the sides of the lake wooded down to the water's edge—occasional clearings &amp; farmsteads
                at distant intervals.—</p>
                <p>This morning we have a little rain, &amp; I write this in Mr. S's office overlooking the lake. I propose to leave
                here on Tuesday morning for New York <hi rend="underline">via</hi> Kingston, Albany, &amp; the Hudson River.</p>
                <p>I have not heard of you since Monday, but hope that you are keeping "the better side out." With love to you always.
                </p>
