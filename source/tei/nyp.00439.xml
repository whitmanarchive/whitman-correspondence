            <p>The skeleton-facts of the Osgood publication are these. Osgood &#38; Co. wrote to me
                last May ('81) asking about a new &#38; complete edition &#38; suggesting that they
                were open to proposals. I wrote back that a new &#38; complete edition was
                contemplated but I wanted it distinctly understood that not a line was intended to
                be left out or expurgated&#8212;that the book must be printed in its entirety &#38;
                that those were prerequisites opening to any negotiation.<ptr target="nyp.00439_n6"
                /> They wrote back asking me to send the copy. I sent it. In a few days they wrote
                me that they would publish it. The bargain was closed. I was to have 12&#189; per cent on
                the sales, and the contract was to run ten years. I went on to Boston (Sept.
                    '81)<ptr target="nyp.00439_n7"/> and saw the book through the press&#8212;pub
                last of Nov. '81&#8212;(I think [some?] 3000 must have been published by them since
                    then.)<ptr target="nyp.00439_n8"/></p>
            <p>In their penultimate letter (a month or so ago) Osgood &#38; Co: wrote me that the
                pieces the District Attorney specially &#38; absolutely required to be entirely
                expurgated were <hi rend="italic">To a Common Prostitute</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Woman Waits for Me</hi>&#8212;those left out the rest could be arranged
                without trouble, &#38; he would allow the publication to continue&#8212;<hi
                    rend="italic">but the leaving out of those two pieces was
                indispensable</hi>.</p>
            <p>I shall write you again, dear friend, as any thing occurs or suggests itself that I
                think you ought to know bearing on this matter&#8212;I am well as usual
                now&#8212;after a pretty bad month of illness&#8212;but mainly getting along pretty
                well &#38; in good spirits considering&#8212;</p>
