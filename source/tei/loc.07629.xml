                    sent Kennedy's letter to Bucke as an enclosure. Whitman included two other enclosures along with the letter to Bucke: a January 3, 1889, letter from William D. O'Connor 
                    and a January 4, 1889, letter from Ernest Rhys.</note>

                </opener>
                <p>Back here again last night&#8212;after a fine time of it at Mrs. Nordhoff's,<ptr target="n4141"/> where everyone was so kind &#38; the fun so continued all day long, that I did not find time to write you even a line.</p> 
                <p>There were some jolly young fellows there, &#38; some splendid girls, but among the last 
                    I think Alys Smith<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> may be said to have "taken the cake." Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have delighted your eyes to see her dance,&#8212;"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"&#8212;The house itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
                    the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &#38; far away up &#38; down the Hudson. The place <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#es">would</unclear> 
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03319.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    have thoroughly suited you for a camping spot.</p>
                <p>Passing through New York yesterday, in a bright, splendid sunlight, the rush of life in Broadway made me wish you could have been with me there.</p>            
                <p>After the stupid, half-&#38;-half pretence of Philadelphia, the reckless, go-ahead life in New York is very refreshing. Tell this not to the Philadelphians!</p>                
                <p>No letters arrived at Alpine Bergen for me,&#8212;so I suppose none have reached you! If there are any waiting now, will you mail them on here. I expect to go to Boston on Friday or Saturday&#8212;after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy at Belmont.</p>
                <p>I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &#38; with all my friends&#8212;in the higher, eternal sense, if not always &#38; altogether in the other!</p>

                <p>A Happy New Year!</p>
                <p>I send you the article on Mrs Gilchrist's book from the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Nation</hi>, for which I have never ceased hunting, and which I found where it
                    had no business to be. You will observe that the holy Father sprinkles us with an
                    aspergillus full of ice water. The cold impudence of that <hi rend="underline"
                        >Nation</hi> surpasses.</p>
                <p>Sometime when you are sending you can return me the article for my collection.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03323.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>I have for some time wanted to write to you, but have been strangely ill, and only
                    just able to walk through the office duties. I keep up my spirits as well as I can,
                    but find it all pretty depressing.</p>
                <p>The article by the wretch named Willard<ptr target="loc.03323_n1"/> in the American
                    Magazine filled me with indignation. What a beast a man must be who comes to you
                    with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a
                    magazine!</p>  
                <p>I hope you have read "King Solomon's Mines."<ptr target="loc.03323_n3"/> It is
                    immense. I have read it forty times, I do believe. The battle chapters let one into
                    the spirit of Homer as the translations cannot do. <pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                        facs="loc.03323.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> I wish somebody would rightly
                    review it for the benefit of the Boston school.</p>
                <p>I see the little pieces you send forth. "Yonnondio" is beautiful.<ptr
                    target="loc.03323_n2"/> The Boston <hi rend="underline">Advertiser</hi>, which
                    also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of
                    tribute.&#8212;I think your term, "Shakespeare-Bacon,"<ptr target="loc.03323_n4"/>
                    will stick to Verulam.<ptr target="loc.03323_n5"/> Donnelly<ptr target="n4108"/> is,
                    I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him
                    since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.</p>
                <p>I hope you are keeping reasonably well. Au revoir.</p>
