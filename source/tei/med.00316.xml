         <p>I went up to your house<ptr target="med.00316_n100"/> this morning and took a look at the garden&#8212;Everything growing first rate&#8212;potatoes, tomatoes, corn, cabbages, and all&#8212;I guess upon the whole the garden never looked better at this time of year. We have had opportune rains&#8212;I inquired about the cow, and received a favorable report. . . .</p>
            <p>John, about coming, I am not able to say anything decisive in this letter. . . . Up in your Bureau all seems to go on as usual . . . John, I send you the July Atlantic.<ptr target="med.00316_n2"/> . . .</p>
            <p>I am feeling hearty and in good spirits&#8212;go around more than usual&#8212;go to such doings as base-ball matches and the music Performances in the Public grounds&#8212;Marine Band, etc. . . .</p>
            <p>I hope your parents are well&#8212;I wish you to give them my love&#8212;tho' I don't know them, I hope to one of these days&#8212;remember me to the wife, also.</p>
            <p>I am writing this by my window in the office&#8212;the breeze is blowing moderate, and the view down the river and off along Virginia hills opposite is most delightful&#8212;the pardon clerks are middling busy&#8212;I have plenty of leisure, as usual&#8212;I spent yesterday afternoon at the Hospital, and took tea in the evening at O'Connor's.<ptr target="med.00316_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>Piatt<ptr target="med.00316_n4"/> is trying to get transferred to New York, to the Custom House&#8212;Well, good by for present, you dear friend, and God bless you and wife, and bring you both safe back&#8212;</p>
