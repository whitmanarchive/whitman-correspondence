                <salute>My dear Walt:</salute>   
            </opener> 
            <p> I duly got your letter of May 5th<ptr target="loc.01820_n2"/> and was very glad to
                hear from you. I sent you a letter which came for you on Monday, and which I hope
                you got, and herewith enclose another which Ramsdell<ptr target="n0494"/> left for
                you.</p>
            <p>I earnestly hope George<ptr target="n0700"/> will be better when this reaches
                you.<ptr target="nyp.00263_n3"/> We all felt sobered to know that he was so badly. The turn in the weather
                today, I think will be good for him.</p>
            <p>I can well imagine how you must have felt to see him so, and how sad it must be for
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01820.002_large_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> your
                mother.</p>
            <p>I enclose a letter I got from that child of a burnt father, Allen,<ptr
                target="loc.01820_n3"/> which you can bring back with you when you come. It is truly Pecksniffian,<ptr
                    target="loc.01820_n4"/> and seems to have been written on all-fours. You will
                see that it ends the matter of publishing the book, and he doesn't say a word about
                John Burroughs'<ptr target="n0129"/> book,<ptr target="n0834"/> but of course
                that is understood to be declined also. I have written him, saying that John will at
                once put the book to press himself.</p>
            <p>I had another letter from Raymond<ptr target="uva.00349_n3"/> yesterday, very kind
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01820.003_large_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> and
                friendly. He evidently does not yet know of the Allenâ€“Carleton decision.
                Part of it is about my coming upon the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>&#8212;a sort of hankering treatment of the subject,
                but no offer, which of course he couldn't well make, not knowing exactly how useful
                or available my talent would be to him. He has not heard that I was in New York. I
                shall write him&#8212;today, if I can.</p>
            <p>I think, on the whole, it is probably altogether best that Carleton should have
                nothing to do with "Leaves of Grass," though I would well enough like to have him publish
                the "Notes."</p>
            <p>&#8212;I write in a hurry, nearly <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01820.004_large_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> on mail time. Nelly<ptr
                    target="n4137"/> charged me to send you her love. Your letter was very sweet. I
                think a young girl finding herself beloved or admired by some one unsuspected
                before, must feel as I did when I read how the household thought of me. But I didn't
                lay myself out at all, as you say, and moreover, the evening I was there I had a
                shocking headache.<ptr target="loc.01820_n5"/></p>
            <p>Give my loving remembrance to all, especially your mother. I
                have not yet succeeded in telling you (you know we were interrupted each time we
                began to talk of it,) how deeply she affected me. Her cheerfulness, her infinite
                gentleness and tenderness, were like the deep <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.01820.005_large_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> smile of the evening sky. As
                I saw her that night, with the children on each side, and each leaning a head upon
                her, I thought of the Madonna grown old.</p>
            <p>Charley<ptr target="n0581"/> bade me send you his love. He has been in the most
                extraordinary jolly humor all this week. It is as if the Cheeryble Brothers<ptr
                    target="loc.01820_n6"/> were rolled into one. The <hi rend="underline"
                    >Times</hi> has done him the recent honor of copying at length, and devoting an
                editorial to, besides, one of his late letters to the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Standard</hi>, in which he comes the bloody Roman centurion on a batch <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01820.006_large_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> of
                politicians, sparing not one.</p>
            <p>H. Clapp<ptr target="n6010"/> will end by becoming a respectable citizen. When once a
                man enters upon the downward path, &amp;c. Like De Quincey's<ptr
                    target="loc.01820_n7"/> warning against the practice of <hi rend="underline"
                    >murder</hi>, on the ground that it leads to procrastination and Sabbath
                breaking, so one can see as the guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common
                Council or Board of Aldermen!</p>
            <p>Good bye. I hope George is better today.</p>
