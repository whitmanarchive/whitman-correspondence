                <salute>Dear Tom<!--<ptr target="loc.00716_n2"/>--></salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your letter has just come all right &#38; I am glad to hear from you again. Every
                thing seems to go lovely there with you &#38; the boys &#38; Dr B<!--<ptr target="n0119"/>--> (which is as
                it should be)&#8212;Tom, I often think of you all, &#38; of the last night we all
                got together, &#38; of the friendly parting drink we all had out there on the
                lawn&#8212;seems as if I only got to know you &#38; all best &#38; then time for me
                to clear out&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have some good times here in moderation&#8212;I <choice><orig>cant</orig><reg>can't</reg></choice> go around very lively, but I
                enjoy what's going on wherever I go&#8212;This 31st of May coming I shall be
                62&#8212;but thank the Lord I still feel young at heart &#38; cheery as
                ever&#8212;After I returned last fall from Canada I was first rate all
                along&#8212;put in four good months&#8212;had some rare old times&#8212;will tell
                you when we meet, Tom&#8212;but some six weeks ago was careless enough to get badly
                <choice><orig>chill'd</orig><reg>chilled</reg></choice> all through my whole body, &#38; repeated the next day&#8212;So I have been
                since quite under the weather&#8212;But I am getting over it &#38; feeling quite
                myself again&#8212;I find I can be well enough if I take very particular care of
                myself, how I go, &#38;c&#8212;</p>
            <p>An old doctor here said to me "Whitman you are like an old wagon, built of first rate
                stuff, &amp; the best sort of frame &#38; wheels &#38; nuts&#8212;&#38; as long as
                you are mighty careful, &#38; go slow, &#38; <hi rend="italic">Keep to good
                    roads</hi>, you will last as long as any of us&#8212;but if you get on bad
                roads, or cut up any capers, then <hi rend="italic">look out</hi>"&#8212;I go down
                every week or two (I go tomorrow again) about 20 miles from here right into the
                country, with a family of farmers, dear friends of mine, named Stafford<!--<ptr target="n0852"/>-->&#8212;Keep a
                country store also&#8212;a big family of boys &#38; girls, &#38; Mrs S one of the
                kindest &#38; best women in the world&#8212;how much happier one can be when there
                is good women around&#8212;Does me good to be with them all. Every thing is very old
                fashioned, just suits me&#8212;good grub &#38; plenty of it. My great loafing place
                out there is a big old woods, mostly pine &#38; oak, but lots of laurel &#38; holly,
                old paths &#38; roads every where through the thick woods&#8212;I spend hours there
                every day&#8212;have it all to myself&#8212;go out there well-protected, even in a
                snow storm&#8212;rabbits &#38; squirrels, &#38; lots of birds beginning
                already&#8212;Tom, you would laugh to see me the way I amuse myself, often spouting
                terrible pieces <choice>
                    <orig>Shakspere</orig>
                    <reg>Shakespeare</reg>
                </choice> or Homer as loud as I can yell. (But that always was a
                favorite practice of mine&#8212;I used to do it in the din of Broadway New York from
                the top of an omnibus&#8212;at other times along the seashore at Coney
                Island)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tom, my paper is <choice><abbr>fill'd</abbr><expan>filled</expan></choice> &#38; I must close&#8212;I wanted to write something about
                the running &#38; matches, but must postpone it&#8212;Give my love to all my friends
                there &#38; you yourself, dear boy&#8212;</p>
