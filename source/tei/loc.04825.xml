                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Quite a beautiful afternoon as I write. After frequently
                threatening rain, the sky has cleared up &#38; for a little time
                at least it promises to be fine. So in a few minutes I will walk
                out to meet Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> who sent me word he would come out
                this aft<hi rend="underline">n</hi>.</p>
            <p>I had a letter from him this morning in which he told me that he
                had written to you &#38; to Dr Bucke.<ptr target="n0119"/> So
                I suppose you will get
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01954_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                his letter along with this.</p>
            <p>I am almost clear of my "cold" now, only my long confinement
                to the house has rather taken it out of me. And it makes it more
                difficult for me to get properly acclimatised again. For the wet,
                dull raw weather we are having here, with its variability,
                storms &#38; showers is a great change after the beautiful
                weather we had over there.<ptr target="loc.04825_n2"/></p>
            <p>However, I shall soon be all right again. I don't know when I had
                a cold that took such persistent hold
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01955_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                as this one has done. But the fact is that I got 2 or 3 colds
                in succession&#8212;first in the gale at sea &#38; then in my
                outdoor work in wretched weather.</p> 
            <p>I wrote to Dr Bucke &#38; to Traubel's<ptr target="n4267"/> yesterday.
                To the latter I have sent more detailed particulars of my voyage
                &#38; home coming&#8212;as requested by them&#8212;I wished afterwards
                that I had written them to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, in case
                they might interest you at all, but they hardly seemed worth
                while at the time. And I have written in a microscopic hand that
                is hardly readable.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01956_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Horace reports that you remain pretty much as before.&#8212;Of course
                our best wishes &#38; love are with you anyway. And we hope to hear
                pretty regularly, as heretofore how you are getting on.</p>
            <p>I have not seen much of the "College" friends<ptr target="loc.04707_n3"/> yet. They
                had a meeting at Dixon's<ptr target="loc.04709_n1"/> on Monday night (not well attended,
                the weather being stormy) to discuss Bucke's "Mans Moral
                Nature"<ptr target="loc.04825_n3"/>&#8212;Fred Wild leading the discussion. Dr. J.<ptr target="n4102"/>
                was there, &#38; will doubtless mention it in writing to you.
                I sent a letter as <hi rend="underline">my</hi> contribution
                to the talk.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01957_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Horace says that you refer to my American trip sometimes as
                "a triumph" for me. Anyhow it was a crowning good fortune.
                It is very wonderful to me when I consider how little
                <hi rend="underline">I</hi> had to do with it, how it was shaped
                &#38; guided by external circumstances, &#38; how intimately it
                filled &#38; crowned so much that had preceded. I felt all through
                that, in old phrase, I was indeed led by the Spirit, &#38; divinely
                favoured.</p>
            <p>It must be my care now to turn it to use. This my main aim &#38; prayer.</p>
            <p>But apart from these considerations I am glad to 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01958_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to remember that I have seen you face to face, &#38; talked,
                &#38; eaten &#38; drunk with you in the simplest human way.
                Apart altogether from your books I have met you as
                man with man, friend with friend. And its result has been to confirm
                &#38; strengthen all the bonds which bound me to you before,
                &#38; to deepen my personal love.&#8212;And more besides, yet
                to be unfolded.</p> 
            <p>Please do give my kindest regards to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> &#38; to 
                M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis.<ptr target="n6113"/> With all
                best wishes</p>
