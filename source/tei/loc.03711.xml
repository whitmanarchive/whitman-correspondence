            <p>With this note I send you a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#bbb" cert="medium"
                    >little</unclear> Berkshire almanack which if you look into it at all will

                of the extent and variety of business which the energetic and enterprising lady at

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03711.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Reading. This
                business established by my old and valued friend Mr. George Lovejoy&#8212;whose right hand Miss Langley<ptr target="n4198"/> became in business matters
                of late years <gap reason="illegible" quantity="1" unit="char"/> was purchased at
                his death by her and has since been even further developed. Few people in Berkshire are unacquainted with the name of
                'Lovejoy' as many are reminded by it of obligations incurred and help or advice
                received from him to whom it belonged.</p>
            <p>But what is all this to you?&#8212;Well, merely<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03711.002_large.jpg" type="recto"/> merely a little
                preamble to prepare your mind for a request Miss Langley desired me, when at
                Reading&#8212;(my native town&#8212;) for the New Year's day last week, to make to
                you that you might send her <hi rend="underline">a complete list</hi> of all books
                &#38;c published by you, that she may obtain the same and add them to her General
                Circulating Library.</p>
            <p>I d<unclear reason="cut away" resp="#aa" cert="high">on'</unclear>t quite know why
                she did not write herself but she is a busy woman and she knows that I am<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03711.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/> am glad to promote
                your fame and to help, as far as I may, both her and you and, besides, she
                remembers, what I daresay you have long forgotten, that I had the honour of seeing
                you 'at home' in Mickle St in 1886 <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="low">(august)</unclear> and was very kindly received by <hi
                    rend="underline">the</hi> poet of democracy whose courtesy and truth encourages
                me to hope that this note will find favour or forgiveness with him:&#8212;and Miss
                Langley a reply!</p>
