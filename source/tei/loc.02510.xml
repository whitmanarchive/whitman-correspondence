            <p>Since Monday afternoon last (Aug 17th) we have been all agog with heart gladdening excitement; 
                for on that day J.W. Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> announced his decision to go to America 
                with Dr. B.<ptr target="n0119"/> if possible &amp; asked me to
                enquire about a berth on the "Majestic" &amp; failing that on the "British Prince."</p>
            <p>Unfortunately owing to our late application both ships were full but through the good offices of Capt. Nowell<ptr target="loc.04703_n4"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02510.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                of the "Br. Prince" we have now secured a berth for him on her. According to present
                arrangements, then Wallace will sail on Aug 26th &amp; if all goes well you may expect 
                to see him about Sept 7th. The doctor will sail on the same day for New York where he will 
                be due about Sept 3rd &amp; we hope that he will be able to stay with you until J.W.W. arrives at Camden<ptr target="loc.04823_n3"/></p>
            <p>We are all very sorry that they cannot go in the same ship: but as things are it cannot be
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02510.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                helped &amp; we are too much rejoiced at the thought of his going <hi rend="underline">at all</hi>
                to mind it much tho' the Dr. &amp; Wallace will. A pc received from 
                Dr says:&#8212;"I am disgusted to think that we may be separated on passage."</p>
            <p>I am too full of conflicting emotions to write much at present, &amp; I cannot tell you how much I feel this
                intended visit &amp; all that it implies to me&#8212;&amp; to us all here&#8212;&amp;
                more especially to <hi rend="underline">him.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="underline">My</hi> visit to you was the crown &amp; glory of my life 
                &amp; his will be that &amp; infinitely more.</p>
            <p>I sincerely hope that

                you are keeping better &amp; that your health will permit of your receiving him if only 
                for a short time</p>
            <p>Later</p>
            <p>Many thanks for your kind p.c. of Aug 11th inst<ptr target="loc.02510_n2"/> <hi rend="underline">just</hi> 
                recd J.W.W. has had tea with me&#8212;along with
                R.K.G.<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/>&#8212;&amp; we have had a good time talking 
                over his coming trip. He is delighted with your p.c (about his letter re Ballacooil Isle of Man) 
                &amp; intend writing to you but was unable to do so this mail. 
                He &amp; RK Greenhalgh sent their love as does</p>
