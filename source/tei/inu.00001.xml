        <salute>Edward Dowden, </salute>
<salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your kind letter of April 16<!--not in WWA database; see med.00437--> reach'd me yesterday&#8212;I find it full of animation &amp; cheer, with items 
        of news, &amp;c. interesting to me, &amp; only hope to get letters from you oftener. In my condition they 
        are trebly welcome. My tedious prostration continues&#8212;primarily and mainly an obstinate &amp; baffling
        cerebral affection, on which have been superinduced grave lesions of the stomach &amp; liver, (from the 
        enforced physical inaction of the last twenty-eight months)&#8212;Still I am up &amp; dressed &amp; around every day,
        go out, walk a little, (as I am crippled, left leg, quite badly) but eke out a jaunt with the horse cars, &amp;
        the ferry boats on the noble river here, the Delaware&#8212;all quite handy&#8212;the solution of the problem of recovery, 
        (even partial) is more or less uncertain, but of course I like to proceed on the supposition or assumption
        that I shall get better.
      </p>
      
      <p>Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my contribution to our National
        Centennial. It is to be called "<hi rend="italic">Two Rivulets</hi>"&#8212;(i.e. two flowing chains of prose
        and verse, emanating the real and ideal) it will embody much that I had previously written &amp; that you know,
        but about one third, as I guess, that is fresh. "<hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>," proper, will remain
        as it is identically&#8212;The new Vol. will have nearly or quite as much matter as L. of G. (It is a sort of omnibus,
        in which I have packed all the belated ones, since the outset of the <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>.)<ptr target="inu.00001_n4"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>As I was writing to John Burroughs to day, I have enclosed to him your letter of 16th.<ptr target="inu.00001_n1"/> His address is, <hi rend="italic">Esopus, Ulster Co. New York.</hi> He is there permanently, having built himself a
        stone cottage in a beautiful spot on the banks of the Hudson, 60 miles north of New York City. He comes to see me&#8212;was
        here, well, about three weeks ago. I heard from Tennyson last summer, had a good friendly letter from him.<ptr target="inu.00001_n2"/> I have just had a long, capital &amp; most kind letter from W. M. Rossetti. Thanks for the
        <hi rend="italic"><choice><orig status="unremarkable">Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice></hi>&#8212;the first &amp; second chapters I have read thoroughly&#8212;they are very
        <hi rend="italic">live</hi>&#8212;I shall read it all &amp; write to you&#8212;the Contemporary Review is rec'd&#8212;thanks&#8212;<ptr target="inu.00001_n3"/>
