            <p>Your welcome p'card of July 23<hi rend="underline">rd</hi> reminds me how the time
                has slipped away since my last letter to you. I have now been here in North Wales
                for nearly six weeks, having retreated to these mountains very soon after returning
                from Paris. I am lodged very comfortably in the cottage of a
                quarry-man,&#8212;William Davies, who works at <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars"
                    quantity="9"/>, 5 or 6 miles from here. He is a very good type,&#8212;healthy,
                well-built, good-natured, impulsive, with the over-carefulness of the average
                Welshman tempered by his experiences of American life, for "he went to the States,"
                as they say here, some years back, + travelled far + wide, working in mines +
                quarries. Even now he does not talk English very fluently, + prefers his native
                Welsh, in which he gives me lessons every night on his return from work. Many people
                in the district speak no English at all. The Welsh are a peculiarly adhesive race, +
                stick to their language + old customs, +, it must be added, to their money, with a
                somewhat dubious devotion. An infusion<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03338.002.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> of American generosity + freedom would do them great good. As it
                is, <hi rend="underline"><gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="9"/> +
                    money-making</hi> is the formula of the lives of most of them,&#8212;their
                redeeming quality being their love of music + oratory!</p>





            <p>I found the change here from Paris very striking. The French are exactly opposite in
                every way,&#8212;those who live in Paris at any rate. There the sunshine + the
                gaiety + general friendliness are very pleasantly in contrast with the grey skies +
                the <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="12"/>

                    <corr>monotonous</corr>
                </choice> routine of London. Paris is a sort of ideal New York,&#8212;a New York
                touched with Romance + the finer graces of the Past, but without the youthful
                ardency that pulses in Mannahatta. Paris would delight you greatly, I know, though
                you might have misgivings at last about a life so frivolously secular, so wanting
                (as it seemed to me) in humane + religious aims of the higher kind. But this
                notwithstanding, the charm of those sunny streets, + good-natured <gap
                    reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="12"/> faces, is something to
                remember.</p>
            <p>The Exhibition, I daresay, you have heard enough of. What struck me most of
                all&#8212;much more than the Eiffel Tower + other nine-days wonders, was the endless
                cosmopolitan ebb + flow of the peoples of the world,&#8212;American, Arabian,
                Japanese, Indian, Egyptian, English, Norse:&#8212;a wonderful, undescribable <hi
                    rend="underline">Concourse de Monde</hi>!</p>
            <p>I must stop here to-day&#8212;Post-time!&#8212;hoping to take up the story at greater
                length shortly. Luck has been dead against me of late. I suppose I shall have to
