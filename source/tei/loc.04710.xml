            </opener>
            <p>Your most kind letter of May 9th &#38; 10<hi rend="underline">th</hi> to hand.<ptr target="loc.04710_n2"/> It affects me profoundly that
                you should have written at all under such circumstances of "deadly lassitude &#38; weakness"&#8212;&#38;
                I thank you with a heart full of gratitude &#38; love.</p>
            <p>I cherish the hope that your long spell of weakness may be <hi rend="underline">partly</hi> due to the 
                season, &#38; that as the year<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01178_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                advances your strength may in some measure return, &#38; "the waters come in again." Our loving hopes
                &#38; prayers are with you.</p>
            <p>Copies of the "N E Magazine" have come from Traubel;<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38; last night I had the long looked for pleasure
                of reading his article.<ptr target="loc.04710_n3"/>&#8212;I am delighted with it&#8212;even beyond anticipation mainly, of course,
                because of its new information about <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, but also because of its admirable
                workmanship, &#38; its covert glimpses &#38; unconscious portraiture (in part) of Traubel himself. 
                Every<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01179_large.jpg" type="recto"/> lover of yours owes him a debt
                of gratitude for his long devotion to you, &#38; every thing goes to shew that in himself he merits
                our warm affection &#38; regard, &#38; to heighten them. And they are especially due from <hi rend="underline">us</hi>,
                to whom he has shown such cordial &#38; genereous comradeship.</p>
            <p>Our Bolton holidays at Whitsuntide (for 3 days) begin this morning, &#38; thousands have gone away
                by excursion trains to different parts of the country. 
                The weather, however, has been very unfavourable<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01180_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                all week&#8212;changeable, very cold at times, &#38; showery. I have decided to spend the holiday quietly
                at home, &#38; Sam Hodgkinson,<ptr target="loc.04829_n1"/> one of the friends,<ptr target="loc.04707_n3"/> who is just recovering from "la grippe" is coming
                here to stay with me (Expect him in a few minutes). Doubtless Johnston,<ptr target="n4102"/> too, will run over when
                his professional practice permits.</p>
            <p>The sun is breaking through the clouds &#38; I am hoping for a fine day.&#8212;</p>
            <p>With continual thoughts of you, &#38; a heart full of loving wishes</p>
            <closer> 
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
