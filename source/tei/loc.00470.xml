            <p>I received your latest letter&#8212;I was glad indeed to hear from you&#8212;yet exceeding sorry to hear from Walt that he was feeling so badly&#8212;I hope beyond all things that he is now feeling better<ptr target="loc.00470_n1"/>
            </p>
            <p>The children are quite well and apparently quite happy&#8212;they speak of you often&#8212;and talk only of you and their mamma</p>
            <p>You ask a question in regard to the silence of all our letters in regard to Mrs O'Rielly.<ptr target="loc.00470_n2"/> in regard to this I must say to you that though I cannot tell you in a letter in regard to why the letters are silent in regard to her I can and will explain the matter to you when I see you which I sincerely hope will be before long&#8212;I do not know how soon&#8212;yet as we have made a contract with some Hartford people for a new Engine<ptr target="loc.00470_n3"/>&#8212;I hope I may be sent East early in the summer&#8212;Of one thing I can assure you no one on earth loved Mattie better than she except our own family and though denied&#8212;to the public her company yet they did meet and were happy&#8212;I wrote you very fully in regard to Matties death&#8212;much I could write you about her later life&#8212;abt all she talked about was Walt and yourself&#8212;she had a great desire to see you&#8212;and I am sorry&#8212;very sorry&#8212;that you could not have met&#8212;but fate cannot be helped</p>
            <p>I am feeling pretty well  Have been away from the city [a] great deal of the time lately&#8212;am employed to make a design for water works at Kansas city, and have been up there a good deal lately<ptr target="loc.00470_n4"/>&#8212;shall write you again soon  Love to George and Loo&#8212;and all send love to you</p>
