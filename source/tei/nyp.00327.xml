        <salute>Dear Nelly,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter of yesterday came this morning. Yours of 5th came safe—Sunday night late, 
          (on returning from spending the evening, so you see I gad about <hi rend="italic">some</hi>—)<ptr target="nyp.00327_n2"/> I found it waiting for me, &amp; read it all through. Both letters are welcome. 
          Thank you particularly for the slip from the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>,<ptr target="nyp.00327_n3"/> which I had not seen nor heard of. Nelly, I looked some five or six weeks ago 
        for Mrs. Banfield's letter—&amp; now day before yesterday a second hunt—but cannot find it, 
        &amp; fear it has been destroyed or lost—I am distressed that I cannot find &amp; return it, 
        as I know you think so much of your friend's letters—(Besides moving in this house 
        from the former one—I have twice hurriedly destroyed a large mass of letters 
        &amp; MSS.—to be ready for what might happen)<ptr target="nyp.00327_n4"/>—</p>
      
        <p>I am indeed interested in what you write about Mrs. Huntington<ptr target="nyp.00327_n5"/>—it does not surprise me that she meets emergencies, &amp;c. so splendidly &amp; expands 
            to greater womanly beauty &amp; development—I always thought it in her to do so—Nelly, when you next see her give her my love—I return Willie's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n6"/> picture—dear child—it has pleased me much—I held it a long time in my hand &amp; thought of H street—</p>
      
      <p>Nelly, I think very highly everyway of little Harold's picture—it is, to begin with, one of the best photos ever taken, &amp; it seems so beautiful, 
        &amp; a real <hi rend="italic">man-child</hi>—I liked it much, &amp; have always kept it where I could see it. 
        (Nelly, did you wish me to return it? I have overlooked—or forgotten—any request to that effect in the letter sending it)—</p>
      
        <p>I send my love to Mrs. Brownell—also to Garry Howard<ptr target="nyp.00327_n7"/> when you see her—(what you say of her in your letter I fully endorse as my mature conviction—she is a good, tender girl—true as steel.) Nelly dear, I am guiltless of the cologne present—(don't know any thing about Peter Doyle, in this case)—</p>
      
      <p>Dear Nelly, I feel that you are—or have been—under the depressing influences of 
          Mr Dilles's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n8"/> and Mr. Townsend's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n9"/> deaths—If it were eligible you should come frequently &amp; spend the days with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, to cheer you up—meantime take early opportunities to get a change of scene of surroundings—&amp; often—</p>
      
      <p>It is very fine here, to-day—I have been hobbling out—plenty of snow on the 
        ground—but air, sun &amp; sky delightful—</p>
      
      <closer>
        <signed rend="right">Walt</signed>
      </closer>
      
      <postscript>
        <p>nearly 5—It is near sundown, very fine, &amp; I am going out—as I like to be on the river, 
          (on those strong boats crashing through the ice now plentiful on the Delaware)—I shall probably cross to <name type="place"><choice><abbr>Phil</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice></name>—&amp; mail this letter thence.
