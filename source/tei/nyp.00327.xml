        <salute>Dear Nelly,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter of yesterday came this morning. Yours of 5th came safe&#8212;Sunday night late, 
          (on returning from spending the evening, so you see I gad about <hi rend="italic">some</hi>&#8212;)<ptr target="nyp.00327_n2"/> I found it waiting for me, &#38; read it all through. Both letters are welcome. 
          Thank you particularly for the slip from the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>,<ptr target="nyp.00327_n3"/> which I had not seen nor heard of. Nelly, I looked some five or six weeks ago 
        for Mrs. Banfield's letter&#8212;&#38; now day before yesterday a second hunt&#8212;but cannot find it, 
        &#38; fear it has been destroyed or lost&#8212;I am distressed that I cannot find &#38; return it, 
        as I know you think so much of your friend's letters&#8212;(Besides moving in this house 
        from the former one&#8212;I have twice hurriedly destroyed a large mass of letters 
        &#38; MSS.&#8212;to be ready for what might happen)<ptr target="nyp.00327_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
      
        <p>I am indeed interested in what you write about Mrs. Huntington<ptr target="nyp.00327_n5"/>&#8212;it does not surprise me that she meets emergencies, &#38;c. so splendidly &#38; expands 
            to greater womanly beauty &#38; development&#8212;I always thought it in her to do so&#8212;Nelly, when you next see her give her my love&#8212;I return Willie's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n6"/> picture&#8212;dear child&#8212;it has pleased me much&#8212;I held it a long time in my hand &#38; thought of H street&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Nelly, I think very highly everyway of little Harold's picture&#8212;it is, to begin with, one of the best photos ever taken, &#38; it seems so beautiful, 
        &#38; a real <hi rend="italic">man-child</hi>&#8212;I liked it much, &#38; have always kept it where I could see it. 
        (Nelly, did you wish me to return it? I have overlooked&#8212;or forgotten&#8212;any request to that effect in the letter sending it)&#8212;</p>
      
        <p>I send my love to Mrs. Brownell&#8212;also to Garry Howard<ptr target="nyp.00327_n7"/> when you see her&#8212;(what you say of her in your letter I fully endorse as my mature conviction&#8212;she is a good, tender girl&#8212;true as steel.) Nelly dear, I am guiltless of the cologne present&#8212;(don't know any thing about Peter Doyle, in this case)&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Dear Nelly, I feel that you are&#8212;or have been&#8212;under the depressing influences of 
          Mr Dilles's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n8"/> and Mr. Townsend's<ptr target="nyp.00327_n9"/> deaths&#8212;If it were eligible you should come frequently &#38; spend the days with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, to cheer you up&#8212;meantime take early opportunities to get a change of scene of surroundings&#8212;&#38; often&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>It is very fine here, to-day&#8212;I have been hobbling out&#8212;plenty of snow on the 
        ground&#8212;but air, sun &#38; sky delightful&#8212;</p>

      <postscript>
        <p>nearly 5&#8212;It is near sundown, very fine, &#38; I am going out&#8212;as I like to be on the river, 
          (on those strong boats crashing through the ice now plentiful on the Delaware)&#8212;I shall probably cross to <name type="place"><choice><abbr>Phil</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice></name>&#8212;&#38; mail this letter thence.
        </p>
