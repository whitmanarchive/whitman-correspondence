                rapidly one day he is better the next worse cannot sit up all day more than an hour
                or two at any time, I suppose that Ed<ptr target="n0589e"/> told you he had paralyses

                the Dr<ptr target="n5001"/> says it was caused by blood&#8212;pressure of or on the brain
                &#38; also says that he is likely to "have another attack at any time" I have seen
                pap ill but never like this he cant remember any thing long at a time &#38; seems to
                be all broken up. I don't know how long Monts family will be here as he has left
