            <p>Just a line of birthday greeting, my dearest Friend. May it find you enjoying the
                beautiful spring-time &amp; the grand sights of people &amp; products &amp; the
                music at Philadelphia notwithstanding drawbacks (but lessening drawbacks I earnestly
                hope) of health, lameness. Rejoiced, too, perhaps with the sight of many dear old
                friends whom <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02891.002.jpg" type="verso"/> occasion
                has brought to your city. May all that will do you good come my dearest Friend. And
                not least the sense of relief &amp; joy in having fulfilled the great task, in the
                teeth of such difficulties re-launched safely, more fully, richly equipt the ship to
                sail down the great ocean of Time, bearing precious precious freight of seed to be
                planted in countless successions of human souls; helping forward more than even the
                best lovers of your <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02891.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                poems dream, the great future of humanity. That is what I believe as surely as I
                believe in my own existence.</p>

            <p>The "low star," the great star drooping low in the west has been unusually
                resplendent of a night here lately &amp; by day lilacs &amp; the labernums
                wonderfully brightening dear old smoky London, constant reminders all, if I needed
                any, of the Poet &amp; the Poems so dear to me. </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02891.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>If I do not hear from you to the contrary I aim to take our passage by one of the
                "States" Line of Steamers that come straight to Philadelphia sailing about the 1st
                Sept.&#8212;&amp; I am told one ought to secure one's cabin a couple of months or so
                beforehand. But if there be indeed an increasing hope of your coming here in the
                course of the summer or if you think it would be best for us to go to New York (only
                I want to go at once where we are likely to stop, because of my <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02891.005.jpg" type="recto"/> furniture) let me hear
                as soon as may be dear Friend. Looking at it purely as concerns the young ones, for
                some reasons it is very desirable to come this year &amp; for others to wait till
                next. With Bee<!-- <ptr target="loc.02891_n1"/> --> for
                instance we are both losing time &amp; wasting money by going over another winter
                here when there is no complete &amp; satisfactory medical course to be had. Then as
                regards dear <choice>
                    <orig>Per</orig>
                    <reg>Percy</reg>
                </choice><!-- <ptr target="loc.02891_n2"/> --> he writes me word that though he is doing
                fairly well he does not <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02891.006.jpg" type="verso"/> think he will be able to take a house &amp; marry till next summer&#8212;&amp;
                that I am very sorry for. But then I think that as I could not be with him nor help
                him forward the balance goes down on Beatrice's side, if I am able to accomplish
                it&#8212; </p>

            <p>Good bye my dearest Friend. Loving tender thoughts shall I send you on the 3O<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Solemn thoughts outleaping life, immortal
                aspirations of my Soul toward <hi rend="underline">your</hi> soul. The <choice>
