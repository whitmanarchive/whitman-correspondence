            <p>Just a line of birthday greeting, my dearest Friend. May it find you enjoying the beautiful spring-time &amp; the 
                grand sights of people &amp; products &amp; the music at Philadelphia notwithstanding drawbacks (but lessening drawbacks 
                I earnestly hope) of health, lameness. Rejoiced, too, perhaps with the sight of many dear old friends whom 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02891.002_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                occasion has brought to your city. May all that will do you good come my dearest Friend–and not least the 
                sense of relief &amp; joy in having fulfilled the great task, in the teeth of such difficulties, re-launched 
                safely, more fully, richly equipt the ship to sail down the great ocean of Time, bearing precious precious 
                freight of seed to be planted in countless successions of human souls; helping forward more than even the best lovers of your 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02891.003_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/>
                poems dream, the great future of humanity. That is what I believe as surely as I believe in my own existence.</p>
            <p>The "low star," the great star drooping low in the west has been unusually resplendent of a night here lately &amp; by day 
                lilacs &amp; the labernums wonderfully brightening dear old smoky London, constant reminders all, if I needed any, of the 
                Poet &amp; the Poems so dear to me.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02891.004_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>If I do not hear from you to the contrary I aim to take our passage by one of the "States" Line of Steamers that
                come straight to Philadelphia sailing about the 1st Sept.<ptr target="med.00665_n1"/>—&amp; I am told one 
                ought to secure one's cabin a couple of months or so beforehand. But if there be indeed an increasing hope of 
                your coming here in the course of the summer or if you think it would be best for us to go to New York 
                (only I want to go at once where we are likeliest to stop, because of my 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02891.005_mflm.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                furniture) let me hear as soon as may be dear Friend. Looking at it purely as concerns the young ones, for some reasons it is 
                very desirable to come this year &amp; for others to wait till next. With Bee<ptr target="n0260"/> for instance we are 
                both losing time &amp; wasting money by going over another winter here when there is no complete &amp; satisfactory medical 
                course to be had. Then as regards dear Per<ptr target="loc.02891_n2"/> he writes me word that though he is doing fairly well 
                he does not 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02891.006_mflm.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                think he will be able to take a house &amp; marry till next summer—&amp; that I am very sorry for. But then I think that 
                as I could not be with him nor help him forward the balance goes down on Beatrice's side, if I am able to accomplish it—</p>
            <p>Good bye my dearest Friend—Loving tender thoughts shall I send you on the 30th. Solemn thoughts 
                outleaping life, immortal aspirations of my Soul toward your soul. The 
                <choice><sic>childrens</sic><corr>children's</corr></choice> love too please dearest Friend.</p>
