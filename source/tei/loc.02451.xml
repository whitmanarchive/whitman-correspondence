                am to hear that your health was still so good&#8212;considering.</p>

            <p>You must take extra care of yourself during the cold weather as nothing is more
                dangerous to such as you than a chill or a slight attack of bronchial catarrh.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02451.004.jpg" type="verso"/> I am glad to hear that
                the celluloid negative reached you safely. I am copyrighting the photo: in England
                in your interest</p>

                would it be troubling you too much to send him one of each + I will remit the cash
                for all on receipt?</p>
            <p>I called at his office today but did not see him + I have sent him a facsimile
                (traced) copy of y<hi rend="underline">r</hi> p.c.<pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.02451.005.jpg" type="recto"/> I am writing this in a patient's house
                where pen + ink are not available, while waiting the advent of a tardy "little
                stranger" as I do not wish to miss the mail tonight.</p>
            <p>I hope this will find you in improved health + "with jocund heart still beating in
                your breast."</p>
            <p>I cannot write more at present.</p>
            <p>Again thanking you for y<hi rend="underline">r</hi> kindness + with best love to

                <p>P.S. I have had two more letters from Edmund Mercer. He says he has written to
