                    which consigned Giordano Bruno<ptr target="loc.01176_n1"/> to the 
                    stake still survives in your "City of
                    Brotherly Love."<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02448.002.jpg" type="verso"/> I
                    hope you had a good time &#38; I shall look forward with pleasure to seeing a report
                    of the meeting.</p>
                <p>We had a grand meeting here on Oct 6<hi rend="underline">th</hi> when I read to
                    the friends<ptr target="loc.02440_n6"/> J. W. W.'s<ptr target="loc.04801_n2"/> "occasional 
                    out-of-door notes" upon 
                    yourself and your
                    teaching, which were much appreciated by all. Some of the things that were said
                    in the discussion or rather friendly talk, which followed prompted J. W. W. to
                    write a "Rejoinder" which he requested me to read to the friends on Monday night
                    last (Oct 20<hi rend="underline">th</hi>) when we had another delightful
                    symposium&#8212;some of the friends, Wentworth Dixon,<ptr target="loc.04709_n1"/>

                <p>R. K. Greenhalgh<ptr target="loc.02465_n5"/> has received the copy of the pocket book edition of <hi
                        rend="underline">L. of G</hi><ptr target="med.00869_n1"/> which you kindly sent to him &#38; is greatly
                    pleased with it. On Sunday last he took it to the Parish Church Sunday School,
                    where he is a teacher, &#38; read extracts from it, including the "Prayer of
                    Columbus,"<ptr target="loc.02448_n9"/> to his scholars.</p>
                <p>I had a very cordial letter from Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> the other day in
                    which he said that he would probably see you on the occasion of the Ingersoll
                    Lecture. <hi rend="underline">That</hi> I know will be a great pleasure to you 
                        &#38; I<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02448.004.jpg" type="verso"/> have no doubt
                    you will have a good time together.</p>
                <p>By the way it so happens that Charles Bradlaugh<ptr target="loc.02448_n1"/>&#8212;the English

                    Progress."</p>
                <p>I don't think I have told you that in April last J. W. W. made me a present of a
                    copy of the Thayer &#38; Eldridge<ptr target="loc.00568_n3"/> (1860) Edition of <hi

                <p>I enclose a cutting from <hi rend="underline">The Family Herald</hi><ptr target="loc.02448_n14"/>&#8212;a

                <p>I hope the <hi rend="underline">grippe</hi> has quite left you &#38; that you are now
                    in better health.</p>
                <p>J. W. W. has got back to work but still complains of a lack of nerve energy.</p>

                    D<hi rend="smallcaps">awson</hi>.<ptr target="n5001"/>&#8212;When
                    we spoke of Mr. Ruskin's<ptr target="n3013"/> critic, we did not argue the case
                    between the two men. One is a practical painter who has undoubted genius, and he
                    certainly knows what he is talking about. He thinks that Mr. Ruskin has mistaken
                    notions about art; and we fear you will find that very many artists share that
                    opinion. For our own part, we are pagan enough to say that we do not very much
                    care even if any one tells us that Mr. Ruskin knows nothing about brushes and
                    pigments. His prose is an abiding glory and delight; and, as to the question of
                    his practical ability, we are very well content to let the artists fight it out
                    among themselves. You are quite right&#8212;the critic is born, not made.
                    By-the-way, you speak of <hi rend="underline">Whitman's</hi><ptr target="loc.02448_n16"/> critical powers. Do you know that he is one
                    of the most exquisitely delicate of literary critics? Some of his judgments on
                    such men as Carlyle,<ptr target="n4301"/> Longfellow,<ptr target="n0367"/>
                        Emerson,<ptr target="n1044"/> Scott,<ptr target="n4277"/> Whittier,<ptr target="n1029"/> 
                    Edgar Allan Poe,<ptr target="loc.02448_n12"/> and even Homer<ptr target="loc.02448_n11"/> and 
                    <choice><orig>Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>,<ptr target="med.00858_n4"/> seem 
                    to us almost flawless. In your list of critics you do not
                    mention Matthew Arnold.<ptr target="loc.05536_n4"/> Had it not been for Arnold's
                    most heartbreaking affectation, he would have been among the highest; but he
                    spoiled himself by writing in a fashion which, although it was often felicitous,
                    was more often insufferable. You mention 
                    Schlegel.<ptr target="loc.02448_n2"/> Name of fear! We wish the
                    Germans had never seen <choice><orig>Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>, 
                    and we wish that a serious accident would irrevocably destroy all the
                    works of all the commentators. When a man writes a learned essay to prove that
                    Macbeth was the third murderer, we have got quite far enough.</p>
