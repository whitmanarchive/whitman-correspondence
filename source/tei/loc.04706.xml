                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>  
            </opener>
            <p>My best thanks to you for your kind postcard of March 23<hi rend="underline">rd</hi>.<ptr target="loc.04706_n2"/>—And also thanks to you for your
                    postcard<ptr target="loc.04706_n3"/> to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    Johnston,<ptr target="n4102"/> received this week</p>
            <p>By far the gladdest news we have received for many a day is that contained in your
                latest communication (March 24<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04706_n4"/>);—"even a 
                suspicion of a shade easier, &amp; the long horrible drain spell
                being broken." God grant <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01148.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                that this may indeed be so! It is indeed "a consummation devoutly wished"<ptr target="loc.04706_n5"/> by us,
                &amp; we shall look forward eagerly to further news confirming it. And yet I am
                afraid (if the weather over there at all resembles the weather here) that we must
                wait a little for any <hi rend="underline">definite</hi> confirmation of it. But it
                heartens us to look forward with more assured hope to the better weather coming,
                when you will be able to get out again &amp; to absorb the vitalizing influences of
                the glad spring &amp; summer.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01149.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I cannot tell you how much we feel your unwearied kindness in sending us word of your
                condition. Thanks to you from our deepest hearts.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. &amp; I were both very much pleased in the beginning
                of the week to receive letters from Traubel;<ptr target="n4267"/>—full of
                hearty friendliness &amp; replete with interesting news.—Written at night with
                other work (for the "Conservator"<ptr target="loc.05893_n1"/>) before him, they doubly evidenced his kindness
                &amp; good will. Nor were they less interesting to us as coming from one who is so
                much about you, &amp; as emanating <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01150.jpg" type="verso"/> indirectly (in a sense) from you too. Thanks to you both.</p>
            <p>The weather here has been very stormy lately—yesterday &amp; today especially
                so. As I write a strong S. E. wind is blowing, with cold heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow (Saturday) I expect Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> to spend the
                afternoon with me—&amp;, if the weather is better, perhaps Dr. J.</p>
            <p>Hoping for better news, &amp; with best love always,</p>
            <closer> 
                <salute>I remain</salute>
