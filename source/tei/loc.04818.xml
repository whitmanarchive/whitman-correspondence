                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A few lines only&#8212;of loving greeting and good wishes.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I saw D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> yesterday afternoon for a few 
                minutes. He told me that he had received a letter from Traubel,<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38; had 
                sent it to the office to me. But as I have not been to the office since (been out of town on 
                business) I have
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01900_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                not yet seen it.</p>
            <p>I understand that he reports you to continue about the same, without any visible improvement, but 
                also no worse&#8212;I am glad to hear of your driving in the open air, &#38; am sure you will derive 
                benefit from it.</p>
                <p>Since I began this letter Rev<hi rend="underline">d</hi> S. Thompson<ptr target="loc.04818_n5"/> 
                called here &#38; I accompanied him part way home to Rivington. Cool evening, but air deliciously 
                fresh, sweet, tonic &#38; bracing. Beautiful sky &#38; cloud effects,
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01901_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                with most delicate &#38; lovely variations of colour &#38; shade on hill &#38; moorlands.</p>
            <p>Quite a cold wind though all day, but fresh &#38; tonic.</p>
            <p>Had a good time on Sunday evening. Bright warm sunshine, clear atmosphere &#38; a wonderful sky. 
                Got up into the fields above Rivington (alone) commanding a wide view seaward (westward). 
                Had L. of G. with me &#38; read most of the "Song of Myself," carefully &#38; studiously. Cattle 
                grazing near, every influence sweet, sanative, &#38; beautiful beyond expression.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01902_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Last night was almost equally beautiful, but colder, with strongish wind. I had a walk again round 
                the nearest lake&#8212;L. of G. as usual my companion.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. is expecting an assistant<ptr target="n5001"/> soon, &#38; I hope that he will be able 
                to share some of my evenings here with me.</p>
            <p>Some of the friends were here on Saturday,&#8212;D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J amongst them. But 
                he would probably tell you after his return.</p>
            <p>If only my letter could convey you a breath of our English air tonight!&#8212;vitalizing bracing, 
                sweet,&#38; exhilirating.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01903_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>It may at least convey loving thoughts &#38; wishes&#8212;or some hint of them&#8212;the most untold.</p>
            <p>In a recent letter I referred to two early notices of L. of G. in the "United States Review" 
                &#38; the "American Phrenological Review" as wonderfully appreciative, &#38; apparently heralding 
                a better acceptance than has come. How stupid it was of me not to see that they were your own! I 
                supposed them to be written by friends in sympathy with you, &#38; was astonished by their powerful 
                &#38; kindred style.<ptr target="loc.04818_n3"/>

                D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> let daylight into it at once when he told 
                me <hi rend="underline">you</hi> had written them, &#38; it astonishes me now that I should have 
                <hi rend="underline">needed</hi> to be told.&#8212;</p>
            <p>I hope that tomorrow, or the day following, will bring further news of you&#8212;&#38; I trust 
                <hi rend="underline">better</hi> news.&#8212;</p>

                <p>Here at Johnston's. Had tea with D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> &#38; wife,<ptr target="loc.04820_n4"/> &#38; have since had a 
                good time reading a good, long letter from Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> p.c. from yourself,<ptr target="loc.04818_n2"/> 
                &#38; a short letter from our dear friend Traubel.</p>
            <p>This mg. I received your long kind letter of July 19 &#38; 20<ptr target="loc.04818_n4"/> which D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> J. 
                has just read. (am sending a copy on to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke).</p>
            <p>Grateful thanks to you for the letter&#8212;It grieves us very much that you
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01906_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                have to report "bad days and nights" &#38; that the "bladder affliction has returned." Loving 
                sympathy &#38; best wishes to you.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your kind considerate approval of my negative decision (for the present) 
                <hi rend="underline">re</hi> visit to you.<ptr target="loc.07969_n2"/> But I live in hopes that the circumstances which now 
                prevent my coming will set me at liberty before long. If only I could <hi rend="underline">do</hi> 
                something when I come!</p>
            <p>I have been deeply moved by letters from Traubel
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_vm.01907_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                &#38; his wife,<ptr target="loc.08060_n3"/> full of the most ardently affectionate &#38; tactful appeals to come 
                over&#8212;letters which, in any event, I shall prize while I live</p>
            <p>All lovers of yours are indebted to Traubel for his long &#38; loyal service to you. And it will 
                be a great joy to me if I am privileged to see him &#38; his good wife for their own sakes.</p>
            <p>Wonderful how your friends are united in affection &#38; comradeship&#8212;not only towards 
                <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, our supreme &#38; dearest friend&#8212;but towards each 
                other:&#8212;a brotherhood

                destined to expand more &#38; more &#38; to bring to fact &#38; reality the cherished dream of ages.</p>
            <p>As I write Johnston is busy on the other side of the table cutting photographs, mounting them 
                &#38;c for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> looking quite aglow with happy activity</p>
            <p>Dull sky outside, threatening rain&#8212;passing cabs, cars &#38;c rattling or rumbling along the street.</p>
                <p>Love to you from both, &#38; from the friends<ptr target="loc.04707_n3"/> to whom I have <choice><sic>shewn</sic><corr>shown</corr></choice>
