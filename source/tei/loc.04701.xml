            <p>I was extremely pleased yesterday morning to receive your post card of the 10th<ptr target="loc.04701_n1"/> inst., with its cheerful account of yourself and its loving benediction. Thank you from my heart.</p>
            
            <p>How much I feel your kindness I cannot fully tell you. But if, </p>

            <p>(as you say) you "sent out 'Leaves of Grass' to arouse, &#38; set flowing, endless streams of living, pulsating love &#38; friendship, directly from us to yourself, now &#38; ever."&#8212;you have still further done so, in <hi rend="underline">our</hi> fortunate experience, by your continued loving&#8212;kindnesses &#38; affectionate words. Thanks, and again thanks, &#38; God bless you.</p>
            
            <p>To your "terrible, irrepressible yearning&#8212;your</p>

            <p>never-satisfied appetite for sympathy"&#8212;alas! we can only partially respond, (for what are <hi rend="underline">we</hi>?) but our heart's best love is yours, and a reverence &#38; gratitude such as we feel towards no one else.</p>
            
            <p>We are deeply sorry to learn that you have been so unwell of late. We hoped that the improved condition of your health reported to us at Christmastide had continued,&#8212;until we were alarmed by a newspaper</p>

            <p>paragraph which seemed to <choice><sic>shew</sic><corr>show</corr></choice> that you had had a bad relapse. It is reassuring now to learn that it has not been so bad as we feared, &#38; that you "might be much worse."&#8212;&#38; we hope to hear better news before long.</p>
            
            <p>The other night I picked up a little book at the Railway bookstall, which I have been looking over tonight. It is called: "<hi rend="underline">In Darkest London</hi>"</p>

            <p>and is a story of a Salvation Army captain engaged in the East end. It gives a very painful &#38; realistic account of the horrible misery, destitution &#38; vice prevailing, &#38; of the noble self-sacrificing effects of men &#38; women, (Agnostics, Salvationists &#38;c) who with love &#38; pity, do what they can to lessen its misery. The hero of the story breaks down in health, &#38; is ordered into Kent, where he visits a</p>

            <p>To find your name in such a story was like seeing a beam of light in a dark place. And I was glad to think of, &#38; to read once more, your "<hi rend="underline">Song of the Universal</hi>," &#38; to be cheered by its "quenchless faith."</p>

            <p>Last night I called to enquire about a young girl, (18), who is slowly dying. It stirred me to hear the accounts of her:&#8212;"a triumph of patience. When she is the better side out she is always singing. (Can scarcely hear her speak but <hi rend="underline">sings</hi> pretty clearly)&#8212;and when in pain praising."</p>
            
            <p>"Out of the mouths of babes &#38; sucklings Thou hast ordained strength," and things</p>

            <p>I cannot write any more now. But with best love always</p>
            
            <p>I remain</p>
