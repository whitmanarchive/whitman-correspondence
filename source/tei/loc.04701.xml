                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was extremely pleased yesterday morning to receive your post card of the 10<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04701_n1"/> inst., with its cheerful
                account of yourself and its loving benediction. Thank you from my heart.</p>
            <p>How much I feel your kindness I cannot fully tell you. But if, <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01108.jpg" type="verso"/> (as you say) you "sent out 'Leaves of
                Grass' to arouse, &amp; set flowing, endless streams of living, pulsating love &amp;
                friendship, directly from us to yourself, now &amp; ever."<ptr target="loc.04701_n5"/>—you have still
                further done so, in <hi rend="underline">our</hi> fortunate experience, by your
                continued loving-kindnesses &amp; affectionate words. Thanks, and again
                thanks, &amp; God bless you.</p>  
            <p>To your "terrible, irrepressible yearning—your <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01109.jpg" type="recto"/> never-satisfied appetite for
                sympathy"—alas! we can only partially respond, (for what are <hi rend="underline">we</hi>?) but our heart's best love is yours, and a reverence
                &amp; gratitude such as we feel towards no one else.</p>
            <p>We are deeply sorry to learn that you have been so unwell of late. We hoped that the
                improved condition of your health reported to us at Christmastide had
                continued,—until we were alarmed by a newspaper <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01110.jpg" type="verso"/> paragraph which seemed to <choice>
                    <orig>shew</orig> 
                    <reg>show</reg>
                </choice> that you had had a bad relapse. It is reassuring now to learn that it has
                not been so bad as we feared, &amp; that you "might be much worse."—&amp; we
                hope to hear better news before long.</p>
            <p>The other night I picked up a little book at the Railway bookstall, which I have been
                looking over tonight. It is called: "<hi rend="underline">In Darkest London</hi>"
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01103.jpg" type="recto"/> and is a story of a
                Salvation Army captain engaged in the East end. It gives a very painful &amp;
                realistic account of the horrible misery, destitution &amp; vice prevailing, &amp;
                of the noble self-sacrificing effects of men &amp; women, (Agnostics, Salvationists
                &amp;c) who, with love &amp; pity, do what they can to lessen its misery. The hero
                of the story breaks down in health, &amp; is ordered into Kent, where he visits a
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01104.jpg" type="verso"/> village
                graveyard.—"Long grass grew over the graves, such as Walt Whitman calls 'the
                hair of the dead'" &amp;c &amp;c.<ptr target="loc.04701_n3"/></p>
            <p>To find your name in such a story was like seeing a beam of light in a dark place.
                And I was glad to think of, &amp; to read once more, your "<hi rend="underline">Song
                    of the Universal</hi>," &amp; to be cheered by its "quenchless faith."<ptr target="loc.04701_n4"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01105.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Last night I called to enquire about a young girl, (18), who is slowly dying. It
                stirred me to hear the accounts of her:—"a triumph of patience. When she is
                the better side out she is always singing. (Can scarcely hear her speak but <hi rend="underline">sings</hi> pretty clearly)—and when in pain
                praising."</p>
            <p>"Out of the mouths of babes &amp; sucklings Thou hast ordained strength," and things
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01106.jpg" type="verso"/> "hid from the wise
                &amp; prudent" are "revealed to babes."<ptr target="loc.04701_n2"/> Surely this is
                the victory that overcomes the world—a victory we should all share—the
                glad soul recognizing tender love &amp; care &amp; grounds for hope—in <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the circumstances of life &amp; death.</p>
            <p>I cannot write any more now. But with best love always</p> 
            <closer>
                <salute>I remain</salute>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
