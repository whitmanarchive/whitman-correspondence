            <p>I hope to live to see you and have a good talk. I am writing in a hurry, Charlie was
                going down town. I took a notion all at once to send my pictures, I have <pb

                these I send of his are bad are not a good likeness, Browns, look more like me.
                Charlie did not like Browns at all at first (he does not say so much against them now) so of
                course I felt disappointed. If I get a good full face I will send it. I am afraid
                these will not be very satisfactory. I <choice>
