            <p>I see in the papers, with agitation and alarm, the reports about your illness, which,
                however, are so vague that I can hope they are exaggerations, and that you are no
                worse than when you sent me the postal card of the 18th of May.<ptr target="syr.00035_n1"/> You were bad enough then, God knows, and I felt downcast
                at your condition, though trusting that it was no more than an ill turn, which would
                pass. I would have written to you earlier, but have had several hideous days myself,
                and been unfit to write.</p>
            <p>One paper speaks of Mr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> as being with you. I hope this is
                    <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> Bucke, and that he may have come down to you from
                    Canada.<ptr target="syr.00035_n2"/></p>
            <p>I wait anxiously to hear how you are. If I were not so badly
                crippled—especially the last few days—I would try to come and hear for
                myself. But I should be in the way, considering my condition.</p>
            <p>If Doctor Bucke is with you, I hope he will pencil me a word, if he can.</p>
            <closer>
