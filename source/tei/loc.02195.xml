                <salute>Dear Walt;</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Painter and picture<ptr target="loc.02195_n4"/> arrived in Hampstead a week ago last Friday without any
                misadventure. The Custom house offices in Liverpool gave me no trouble, and beyond
                paying heavily for overweight luggage from Liverpool to London I experienced no
                difficulty. </p>
            <p>Before writing I wanted a few people to see the work. </p>
            <p>To begin with, Grace<ptr target="n0890"/> is surprised and pleased with it&#8212;the
                picture comes up closely to her recollection of you &#38; she thinks that your
                admirers will be interested and pleased with the portrait. On Sunday <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02195.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> i.e. the day
                before yesterday some dozen literary men &#38; women looked in. Miss Brooke for
                instance (author of "An Heir without a Heritage") thinks you look grand,<ptr
                    target="loc.02195_n1"/> and that the picture "emanates" a living personality,
                and that there is a peculiar light and glow about it at all, as though it was
                painted near sundown.</p>
            <p>Bernard Shawe (a delightful Irishman who reviews books in the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Pall Mall</hi> cleverly)<ptr target="loc.02195_n2"/> it was rather
                dark&#8212;late in the afternoon when he arrived, he thought there was a joyous
                spirited look about its execution.&#8212;asked me if I was not pleased with it
                myself? </p>
            <p>Mrs Arthur Wilson<ptr target="loc.02195_n3"/> (a spirited socialist&#8212;"what a
                splendid old lion." In fact it is quite evident that the picture <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02195.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> gives people
                quite a new and vivid presentation of your personality here. Buxton Forman<ptr
                    target="n0240"/> wouldn't hear of its being "commonplace" thought Bucke's<ptr
                    target="n0119"/> remarks about it out of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg"
                    cert="low">a mist</unclear> i.e. to try &#38; give 'a youthful fire to the
                eyes.' </p>
            <p>Ernest Rhys<ptr target="loc.03310_n1"/> took high-tea with us yesterday, he only saw
                it by lamp-light, but Rhys said it gave him a distinctly new, fresh and enlarged
                idea of your personality, &#38; that he was very glad to have seen it before
                starting for America. He intends to start in about 3 weeks time, and thinks that he
                will be in Camden about the middle of November. I have asked him to call on Talcott
                    Williams,<ptr target="nyp.00459_n4"/> perhaps you will give him a "leg up" among
                newspaper men? He is going out in a cargoe-boat, so <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02195.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I should fear that he will be
                pitched and rolled about a good deal.</p>
            <p>I had a smooth passage across except the last two or three days when it was quite
                rough. </p>
            <p>I look back upon my visit to the States with great pleasure&#8212;it is a lovely
                country&#8212;and I remember the jolly talks &#38; dinners that I've had at your
                house. </p>
            <p>I find that your portrait is <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="medium"
                    >searchingly</unclear> carried through and that there is little more to do to
                it&#8212;except the hands.</p>
            <p>Please give my very kind regards to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="loc.03745_n2"/> &#38; With
                love to Walt. </p>

            <postscript>
                <p>Rhys think this work shows more "resource" than anything I have done. I think so
                    too.</p>
