            <p>"That my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps 
                to see each other, is every bit as wonderful"<ptr target="loc.03147_n1"/> and that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful, 
                and that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true is just as wonderful." Indeed there is very 
                little in Leaves of Grass but what I know to be true. It is some more than two years since I first read your book, 
                and sometimes I have felt so in <choice><sic>raport</sic><corr>rapport</corr></choice> with your feelings therein 
                expressed that I have written you <choice><sic>dozzens</sic><corr>dozens</corr></choice> of letters, and I have no 
                doubt you would have got them, had they been done on paper, or any material <choice><sic>transmittible.</sic><corr>transmittable.</corr></choice>

                I presume I have read "The Open Road" twenty times or more. Last fall I was staying over two months—with 
                Mrs Dr. Severance of Milwaukee.<ptr target="loc.03147_n2"/> I read it to her—and one evening she asked me to read it again, her husband 
                being with us, for she said I read it as tho I understood it. Yes, and how "utterly quelled and defeated" too I 
                have felt to find my strength <hi rend="underline">so much less</hi> than my impulses. The poem "To You" has been 
                worth wonders to me, so inclined am I to self reproach. Your "Song of Myself" I have read over and over again. No 
                poems ever gave me so confident a hope in a continued existence. If only "the lover for whom <hi rend="underline">I</hi> 
                pine will be there"! How I long to find them here! and do—scattered everywhere, and their very existence 
                makes me long for them. All around me I see "Of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the rotten 
                excrement of maggots," and so in my loneliness when I try to be happy with them all that is <hi rend="underline">true</hi> 
                to me 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03147.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                comes up plainer. The effort seems to be—honestly no doubt—to conceal "our real names".</p>
            <p>When I read "You Felons on trial in Courts" The tears flow like rain, and I think how <choice><sic>develish</sic><corr>devilish</corr></choice> 
                I have been to day. I feel imprisoned—I am tied here— but ever hopeful of a release. We have large 
                pleasant grounds—and houseroom enough, but the provider and "head of the house" seems ever determined that 
                we shall realize our dependent positions. How easy it is to discover and acknowledge our superiors, but when any 
                person uses a <hi rend="underline">domineering</hi> superiority over you, <hi rend="underline"><choice><sic>resistence</sic><corr>resistance</corr></choice></hi> 
                seems but natural, and so I hate the one I would gladly love. Hate is to the hater and comes back most to him;</p>

            <p>In our manner of living we are hygienists but yesterday we had company for dinner and so to be sociable after the 
                manner of Col. Ingersol.<ptr target="n0839"/> I drank a cup of coffee. I am a good sleeper naturally but that cup 
                of coffee never lost its hold of me until way after midnight. Leaves

                of Grass laid on my lightstand, and I opened to "Song of the Universe." I read it in a new light. It seemed to me 
                the poetry of SP Andrew's<ptr target="nyp.00185_n9"/> late prophetic lecture before Manhattan Liberal Club.</p>
            <p>I had already marked next to last verse, Oh! how fast the world moves to me when I read such thoughts, and how slow 
                when I carry them with me among my neighbors. If you have not read S.P.A.'s may I send the paper to you?</p>
