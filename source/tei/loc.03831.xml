            </opener>
            <p>I often wonder how you are getting on, with the approach of winter? I hope it will
                find you in a comfortable condition.</p>
            <p>I have come here to Paris for the winter, leaving Oxford at last. Paris is the great
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_jc.00176_large.jpg" type="verso"/> center for
                art now of all Europe&#8212;there are thousands of arts students here from all the
                world. A great deal of good work is being produced, and the atmosphere is very
                exhilarating. Next to the French the best work is done by the Swedes &amp; the
                Americans&#8212;there seems to be a real burst of life among these Northern
                people&#8212;the Swedes, Norwegians &amp; Finns, <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc_jc.00177_large.jpg" type="recto"/> and Ibsen<ptr target="loc.03831_n4"/> is
                not an isolated phenomenon. The American work here is very strong&#8212;there are a
                number of young men who have real genius, I think. I am going this afternoon to see
                the young Brooklyn sculptor<ptr target="loc.03831_n3"/> who is making the great fountain for the Chicago
                exhibition&#8212;it is to cover acres &amp; dispense Mississippis!</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_jc.00178_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>However, he is not frightened by the job, but has a splendid design&#8212;America
                sitting high on a barge, which is rowed by gigantic female figures.</p>
            <p>They are all well in England I think&#8212;my mother<ptr target="n7510"/> is paying a short Temperance
                visit to N.Y. Boston &amp; Chicago with an English friend of hers, but we expect her
                back shortly now.</p>

<!--<note xml:id="loc.03831_n3" type="editorial" resp="wwa">Frederick W. MacMonnies (1863&#8211;1937) was a Brooklyn-born sculptor, painter, and portraitist. He served
    as an apprentice under the French-Irish Scupltor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and also studied with the National Academy
    of Design and The Art Students League of New York. After moving to Paris to continue his training in sculpture
    at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, he opened a studio in Paris and began to create some of his most famous works.
