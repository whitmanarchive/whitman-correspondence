                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I trust the spirit may not be deemed intrusive which urges me to write &amp; wish you
                a happy New Year, &amp; to thank you at the same time for the happiness which I have
                had in reading "November Boughs."<ptr target="n3999"/> Christmas brought me a copy, the result of a
                special petition to Santa Claus, &amp; now I can look back through all the wisdom
                and beauty <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02593.002.jpg" type="verso"/> of
                its pages, &amp; forward to a long intimacy with them, such as one has with one's
                own few books. I am so glad you wrote that "backward glance." It will be precious to
                all lovers of your poetry, &amp; stand as the truest &amp; most upright answer to
                its critics. Perhaps you do not know how great a pleasure it is to those who love
                poetry to see their poets again&#8212;Burns, Shakespeare, &amp; the rest&#8212;with
                a poet. It is like going through a gallery of paintings with an artist.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02593.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>And your notes on Elias Hicks,<ptr target="n0301"/> a figure whom I might never have
                met elsewhere, were full of interest to me. It is very true that note on "The United
                States Today," &amp; so far as decline of spirituality is implied in that of
                definite beliefs, it is deeply to be regretted, and yet, amid such varied elements,
                one may say&#8212;is perhaps even more bound to say than in other parts of the
                world&#8212;"I will not accept a part for the whole, join one group of my fellow
                beings <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02593.004.jpg" type="verso"/> &amp; cut
                myself off from the rest." The strongest spirituality has been shown here in
                individualities, in going direct to the heart of things, &amp; that is what you are
                helping us to know &amp; to feel.</p>
            <p>We have not heard any news of you for a long time, but hope earnestly that your
                health is better. My father joins me in heartfelt regards&#8212;</p>

            <p>Very sincerely yours</p>
