                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> Just a line to give you my changed address. I have been here
                since October last&#8212;very busy all last summer getting a little homestead built,
                and this winter digging and planting&#8212;have about seven acres
                altogether&#8212;we are gardening about two acres; fruit, flowers and vegetables;
                have about two and a half acres grass and about the same quantity part wheat for
                ourselves and part oats for the horse. My friends the Fearnehoughs<ptr
                    target="n3063"/> have come with me, and we are employing one or two extra hands
                beside, just now. It is a beautiful valley right up against the Derbyshire moors,
                but warm; we are about eight miles form Sheffield and five and a half from
                Chesterfield&#8212;three and a half from the nearest station. </p>
            <p> I got your bit about the American aborigines.<ptr target="uva.00452_n1"/> Thanks. </p>
            <p> There is a quite old flour mill here, from which the place no doubt takes its name;
                very quaint old wooden wheels and cogs&#8212;the stream which feeds it runs at the
                bottom of my three fields&#8212;lots of wood and water all about the valley.
                Millthorpe itself is a small hamlet of a dozen houses or so. </p>
            <p> Have not seen the Gilchrists<ptr target="n3001"/> for some time, but I heard from
                Grace the other day. </p>
            <p> I was reading Rolleston's<ptr target="n1027"/> translation into German of your
                Answerer this morning. It is as far as I can judge very exact and natural. </p>
            <p> I hope you are well and enjoying yourself. I often think about you. Best
                remembrances to the Staffords<ptr target="n1009"/> when you see them. </p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Your affectionate</salute>
