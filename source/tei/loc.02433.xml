                <salute>Dear Uncle Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I did not imagine that so many days would have flown by before I informed you of the
                great joy that came to us all on the twenty-second of January, when our dear
                Grace<ptr target="n7015"/> received the sweet dignity of Motherhood. The baby
                came to our world of strife under just such <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02433.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> conditions as would rejoice your heart.
                Ideal physical conditions, perfect mental and spiritual equilibrium in the pure
                hearted Mother, have given the dear little baby girl such a start in life as I wish
                were possible for every human being—the little one will surely be a power for
                good in the future. Just now however, she makes a noise in the world very similar to
                that by which other tiny infants make known their wants. Grace herself is just
                lovely, and with her baby by her side, is a subject such as would have inspired a
                Raphael.<ptr target="loc.02433_n8"/> Frances Alma is to be the little one's name. The "Frances" is in honor of
                Mama,<ptr target="loc.02312_n4"/> May,<ptr target="loc.04403_n4"/> and the eleven year
                old Franklin<ptr target="loc.02433_n7"/> whose birthday is also on the twenty-second.
                "Alma" is after dear Mother,<ptr target="n3029"/> of course. The children are all as
                proud as can be of the newcomer, and the acme of happiness is reached when allowed
                to hold the little mass of "unlocated sensations."</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02433.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>Friday night we had the great pleasure of listening to a fine analysis of the
                writings (or rather meaning of the writings) and the influence of Thomas Paine.<ptr target="loc.02433_n9"/> The
                lecturer was Edward King,<ptr target="loc.02433_n10"/> the Little Giant. Moncure R.
                    Conway,<ptr target="n0170"/> Father,<ptr target="n0336"/> George Francis
                    Train<ptr target="loc.02433_n4"/> and others spoke afterwards. Mr. King laid
                special emphasis on the fact that Paine, spite of his iconoclastic flaws was
                constructive, sympathetic rather than destructive. That his aim was to replace
                superstition with a religion based on facts that are <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02433.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to be deduced from ever present
                phenomena of the physical and moral worlds. The courage and steadfastness of the
                man, shown by his taking a stand in opposition to his friends even, when conscience
                required it, were dwelt upon. And oh, to think of our ungrateful country! I wonder if
                there is a school history in the country that gives the least hint of what we owe to
                the efforts of Thomas Paine in behalf of the liberties of man. I am sorry I have <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02433.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> no newspaper clippings
                to send you—Mr. Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> too would have greatly enjoyed
                the evening as he is an admirer of Paine. I hope he reached Camden alive. New York
                must seem to him a very inhospitable place for his train was run into just as the
                city was reached and when he left, it was after a very slim breakfast.</p>

            <p>We see Emma <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#bbb">Frag</unclear> Jenks<ptr target="n5001"/> quite often. She is like a bit of sunshine,
                and her husband<ptr target="n5001"/> is a fine young fellow. What we particularly appreciate in him is
                that on Tuesday nights he is willing to have her attend our Society for Political
                Study and then at ten o'clock he comes after her, which every young husband might
                not be willing to do. She does such pretty work in water-colors—.</p>

            <p>I wish you could have a glimpse of our boys' playroom. At first glance it is
                "confusion worse confounded"<ptr target="loc.02433_n5"/> but when viewed in detail
                it resolves itself <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02433.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                into four little domains—Harold's,<ptr target="n2006"/> Franklin's, 
                Calder's<ptr target="loc.02432_n1"/> and Edwin's.<ptr target="n5001"/> At one
                time soldiers strew the battle-fields—again the tooting of the locomotive is
                heard, or the shouts of Stanley<ptr target="loc.02433_n6"/> and his men—as
                they plunge through Darkest Africa—and the agonies those small boys endure if
                perchance a rustling skirt should ruin a little settlement.</p>

            <p>Mother has just read me some words of John Swinton<ptr target="n0611"/> taken from
                to-day's Sun in which he recalls a day spent with you in the hospitals and expresses
                his appreciation of all you were to your beloved soldiers—</p>

            <p>All send much love—</p>
