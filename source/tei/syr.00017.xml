                <salute>My dear friend and master&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am at last able to send you the lecture, which I have now got published together
                with another by a friend of mine here, delivered before the same society. I hope it
                may do something, however little, towards making the <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> known here. If any American bookseller would like it, which is not, I
                suppose, very probable, he must write to the publisher, Tittman. We are selling it for 1 mark, which
                = I think a quarter of a dollar, about. I have sent a copy to D<hi
                    rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Bucke. Would you kindly
                transmit one to W. O'Connor? whose address I don't know. As to D<hi
                    rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi>
                Knortz, I fear it
                would be quite impossible to carry on the work of translation with him at such a
                distance. I have appended to my lecture a <choice>
                    <abbr>transl.</abbr>
                    <expan>translation</expan>
                </choice> of the Song of the Answerer, &amp; in getting this <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="syr_kc.00050_large.jpg" type="verso"/>translation into final form, I was
                astonished at the amount of discussion it gave rise to, between myself &amp; a German friend who
                looked over my proofs, showing that it would be quite impossible to carry on the work of
                translation with another person across the Atlantic. Besides I greatly doubt if he
                would go into it. His admiration for the <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> is decidedly qualified by objection to your system of punctuation, use of
                participles, &amp;c., which matters seem to bother him more than they ought. His
                translations are sympathetic &amp; effective for the poetic passages&#8212;but when
                he converts a word whose meaning is a little remote or unusual, he <hi
                    rend="underline">evades</hi> the difficulty. For instance, here is his rendering
                of a passage from the Mystic Trumpeter (<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">st.</unclear> 5).</p>
            <q><lg>
                <l>&#8212;Blow again, Trumpeter! Take for thy theme</l>
                <l>The All-encloser, the Redeemer and Orderer&#8212;</l>
                <l>Love, pulse of the All, of sorrows &amp; of joys,</l>


                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr_kc.00051_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <l>The heart of man and woman;</l>
                <l>No other theme than love&#8212;immortalizing, all-embracing, self-surrendering
                    Love.</l>
            </lg></q>
            <p>On the whole I begin to fear that a complete translation is not feasible, at present.
                But I might possibly reckon on assistance enough to produce good renderings of, say,
                8 or ten of the longer poems, which might then be published in a small book&#8212;&amp; perhaps pave the way for something more: What would you think of this?</p>
            <p>I am sending McKay a copy of the lectures &amp; am asking him that we have a copy of the <choice>
                    <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> with broad margins, if he has got one. The 1882 reprint is not very
                satisfactory in this way to me at least, as I like to make notes &amp; references in
                the book.</p>
            <p>Things are going badly in Ireland. The <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"
                    resp="#kc"><choice><abbr>Gov<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">t</hi></hi></abbr>
                        <expan>Government</expan>
                    </choice></unclear> is putting down meetings (of the National party) right &amp;
                left, for no reason, &amp; the people are getting very exasperated. I had hoped
                great things <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00052_large.jpg" type="verso"/>from
                Gladstone's government, but that accursed Egyptian war opened my eyes finally to the
                mixture of hypocrisy &amp; injustice which lie at the root of English policy. If you
                could only live in Ireland for a while, &amp; see this sensitive, keen sighted, but
                helpless nation dragged about in the clumsy lurches of English
                Opportunism&#8212;seeing it all, knowing its own mind &amp; ideal but condemned to
                incapacity for realizing it,&#8212;you would wish us God speed. And yet I did not
                always see my way to these views myself. Now I must close&#8212;I was very glad to hear
                of your health &amp; pleasant circumstances, &amp;c. in your last letter. May this one find it all unchanged.</p>
