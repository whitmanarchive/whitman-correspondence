                <head><handShift rend="printed"/>DIED IN THE ARMY</head>

                <p> <handShift rend="printed"/>The number of deaths that occurred in the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#if">Union</unclear> armies during the slavery war is a question which has been
                    widely discussed ever since the collapse of the Confederacy. Many efforts were
                    made to obtain reliable statistics,
                    and each <gap reason="cut away"/> the investigations have brought inquires
                    closer to <gap reason="cut away" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> be the correct figures. The <gap reason="cut away" quantity="3" unit="chars"/>" researches was
                    undertaken something <gap reason="cut away" quantity="1" unit="chars"/>
                    <gap reason="cut away" quantity="4" unit="line"/> General Richard C. Drum, who
                    entrusted to Mr. J. W. Kirkley the important work. That gentleman had the
                    assistance of a number of competent clerks, and a minute and exhaustive
                    investigation was made of all official documents that could be found. The
                    results have just been published, and <gap reason="cut away" quantity="1"
                        unit="chars"/> a valuable addition to war history. </p>
                <p> <handShift rend="printed"/>The period covered by the record is, for the regular troops, from April 15,
                    1861, to August 1, 1865; for a portion of the volunteers it is prolonged beyond
                    the last-mentioned date until the mustering out of each organization. The last
                    white volunteer organization was disbanded November 18, 1867, and the last
                    colored regiment December 20, 1867, and the last officer of the volunteer
                    general staff was not mustered out until July 1, 1869. The report shows that the
                    aggregate of deaths among the Union forces of 359,496, of which 9,584 were commissioned officers and
                    349,912 were enlisted men. In detail these figures were distributed as
                    follows:&#8212;Killed or died, of wounds, 110,<gap reason="cut away" quantity="1"
                        unit="chars"/>; died of disease, 224,586, drowned and other accidental
                    deaths, 4,114; murdered, 524, <gap reason="cut away" quantity="2" unit="chars"/>
                    after capture, 100; committed suicide, 391; executed, 267; executed by the
                    enemy, 64; died form sunstroke, 313; other known causes, 2,034; causes not
                    stated, 12,121. The "other known causes" include deaths resulting from quarrels
                    not amounting to murder, form being shot by sentries by the provost guard, and
                    miscellaneous causes. In these figures it is noticed that the death registers of
                    some of the largest prisons at the South in which Union soldiers were confined
                    are missing, such as the prisons at Americus, Atlanta, Augusta, Charleston,
                    Lynehburg, Macon, Marietta, Mobile, Montgomery, Savannah, Shreveport, and Tyler;
                    and only partial reports are given from Calawba, Columbia, Florence, S. C.
                    Millen, and Salisbury. It is known that 29,498 Union soldiers died in captivity,
                    while in many instances three or four bodies of Union prisoners were interred in
                    the <gap reason="cut away" quantity="1" unit="chars"/> grave or trench. </p>
                <p> <handShift rend="printed"/>The New England <gap reason="cut away" quantity="1" unit="chars"/> are
                    represented by 40,080 recorded <gap reason="cut away" quantity="1" unit="chars"
                    />; New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, 85,531; the Western States by
                    142,489; Missouri, Delaware, Tennessee, and West Virginia, 39,607; from the
                    Pacific States and Territories, including California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington
                    Territory, Dakotah, New Mexico, and Colorado, 7,297; and 3,854 from States
                    included in the Confederacy. It is also observed that 36,847 deaths occurred
                    among the colored troops, 5,798 in the regular army,<gap reason="cut away"
                        quantity="1" unit="chars"/> among the Indian tribes, and 3,<gap
                        reason="cut away" quantity="2" unit="chars"/> among miscellaneous organizations. </p>
                <p> <handShift rend="printed"/>In addition to bearing testimony of the good conduct of the Union officers as a
                    whole &#8212;nd fewer than 6,365 of whom were killed in action or died of
                    wounds&#8212;the report contains many important and interesting details. The
                    State of Illinois lost 34,834 men, of whom 1,948 died in Rebel prison pens;
                    Indiana, 4,753; Minnesota, 2,584; Nebraska, 239; Ohio, 35,475; Wisconsin,
                    12,301. </p>
                <p> <handShift rend="printed"/>Taking the three most important causes, we find that 4,142 officers and 62,896
                    men were killed in action; 2,223 officers and 40,777 men died of wounds and
                    2,795 officers and 221,791 men died of disease. Among the enlisted men 30 per
                    cent. of the total deaths were of those killed by the enemy, and 66&#8532; per
                    cent. of the officers form the same cause. Among the men 63 per cent of the
                    deaths were occasioned by disease. </p>
