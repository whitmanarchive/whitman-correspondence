            <p>The 3d July was my rejoicing day, dearest
                Friend,&#8212;the day the packet from America reached me scattering for a while the
                clouds of pain and humiliation &amp; filling me through &amp; through with light
                &amp; warmth; indeed I believe I am often as happy reading as you were writing your
                Poems. The long new one "As a Strong Bird"<!-- <ptr target="loc.02867_n1"/> --> of itself
                answers the question hinted in your preface &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02867.002.jpg" type="verso"/> nobly fulfils the promise of its opening
                lines. We want again &amp; again in fresh words &amp; from the new impetus &amp;
                standpoint of new days the vision that sweeps <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">ahead,</supplied> the tones that fill us with
                faith &amp; joy in our present share of life <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&amp; work&#8212;</supplied> prophetic of the
                splendid issues. It does not need to be American born to believe &amp; <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">passionately rejoice in the
                    belief</supplied> of what is preparing in America. It is for humanity. And it
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02867.003.jpg" type="recto"/> comes through
                England. The noblest souls the most heroic hearts of England were called to be the
                nucleus of the race that (enriched with the blood <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&amp; qualities of</supplied> other races &amp;
                planted down in the new half of the world reserved in all its fresh <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">beauty</supplied> &amp;
                exhaustless riches to be the arena) is to fulfil justify outstrip the vision of the
                Poets, the quenchless <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">aspirations of all the ardent</supplied> souls that have ever struggled
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">forward upon this
                    earth.</supplied>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02867.004.jpg" type="verso"/> For me, the most
                precious page in the book is that which contains the Democratic Souvenirs. I respond
                to that as one to whom it means the life of her Soul. It comforts me very much. You
                speak in the Preface <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">of
                    the</supplied> imperious &amp; resistless <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">command from within out of which</supplied>
                "Leaves of Grass" <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">issued.</supplied> This carried with <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">it no doubt</supplied> the secret <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">of a corresponding resistless
                    power over the reader wholly</supplied> unprecedented, <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">unapproached in literature,
                    as</supplied>I believe, &amp; <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">to be compared</supplied>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02867.005.jpg" type="recto"/> only with that of
                Christ. I speak out of my own experience when I say that no myth, no "miracle"
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">embodied
                    the</supplied> notion of a direct communication between God &amp; a human
                creature, goes beyond the effect, soul &amp; body, of those Poems <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription"> on me:</supplied> &amp; that
                were I to put into Oriental forms of<supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription"> speech</supplied> what I experienced it would
                read like one of those old "miracles" or "myths. <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">Thus</supplied> of many things that used to appear
                to me incomprehensible lies, I now <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02867.006.jpg" type="verso"/> perceive the germ of truth &amp; understand that what was called
                the supermantural was merely an inadequate &amp; too timid way of conceiving the
                natural.&#8212;Had I died the following year, it would have been the simple truth to
                say I died of joy. The doctor called it nervous exhaustion falling with tremendous
                violence on the heart which "seemed to have been strained": <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription"> &amp; was much
                    puzzled</supplied> how that could have come to pass. I left <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">him in his puzzle&#8212;but
                    it</supplied> was none to me. How could such <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02867.007.jpg" type="recto"/> a dazzling radiance of light flooding
                the soul, suddenly kindling it to such an intense life, but put a tremendous strain
                on the vital organs? <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">how
                    could</supplied> the muscles of the heart suddenly grow adequate to such new
                work&#8212;O the passionate tender gratitude <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">that flooded</supplied> my
                breast,<!-- I see "heart" here. -JS --> the yearning that seemed to strain the heart
                beyond endurance that I might repay with all my <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">life &amp; soul &amp; body this
                debt</supplied>&#8212;that I might give joy to him who filled me with such joy, that
                I might make his outward life sweeter &amp; more beautiful <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02867.008.jpg" type="verso"/> who made my inner life so divinely sweet
                &amp; beautiful. But, dear Friend, I have learnt to see that this is not to be so,
                now: that for me too <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">love
                    &amp; death</supplied> are folded inseparably together: Death that will renew my
                youth. </p>

            <p>I have had the paper from Burlington<!-- <ptr target="loc.02867_n2"/> --> &#8212;with the details <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">a woman likes so</supplied> to have. I wish I had
                known for certain whether you went on to Boston &amp; were enjoying the music there.
                My youngest boy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02867_n3"/> --> has gone to spend his holiday with his
                brother in South Wales &amp; he writes me such good news of Per.,<!-- <ptr target="loc.02867_n4"/> --> that he is "looking as brown as a nut &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc.02867.009.jpg" type="recto"/> very jolly" &amp; his home in a "clean
                airy old farm house half way up a mountain in the midst of wild rough grand scenery,
                &amp; the sea in sight near enough to hear the sound of it about as loud as the
                rustling of "leaves"&#8212;so the boys will have a good time together, and the girls
                are going with me for the holiday to their grandmother at Colne. W. Rossetti<!-- <ptr target="loc.02867_n5"/> --> does not take
                his till October this year. I suppose it will be long &amp; long before this letter
                reaches <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.02867.010.jpg" type="verso"/> you as you
                will be gone to California <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">&#8212;may it</supplied> be a time full of
