            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>In a former letter, I undertook to
                describe "life and things" in our far-famed Broadway; but my letter only halted
                along, I believe, as far as the Park. A principal beauty of the latter place, this
                fine autumn weather, is the fountain, which they are now allowing to play, after a
                pretty long resting spell. Do you know we have more complete fountains than any
                other city in the world! Paris itself "can't begin" with us in this respect....Off a
                few rods yonder, in front, as you stand with your back to the Astor House, is that
                time-honored edifice—the Park Theatre. Hamblin<ptr target="med.00952_n6"/> has had the front steps taken away,
                and there is now a long, low, roomy outer-lobby. From this you ascend to the
                inner-lobby, shorn of its capacious old proportions—which has given mortal offence
                to some of the most antiquated frequenters of the place, who used to count upon
                walking there during the intermissions, as much as on seeing the play itself.
                Shakspeare, with bare head and crossed legs, yet stands in his niche in front, but
                he seems to "draw" poorly. The knowing ones say that Hamblin has hardly paid his
                expenses since he opened the Park.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Astor House on one corner of Barclay street,
                and the American on the next, must always be much resorted to from their central
                position. It is undeniable, however, that uptown the course of fashion takes it way,
                even in hotels. There is a bitter feeling between the New York and the
                establishments first mentioned....Now you pass music, dry-goods and
                book-stores—places for all sorts of costly nick-nacks—and come to Plumbe's House of
                a Thousand Faces. Have you never been in there? Then enter by all means, and spend a
                good hour in looking over the most remarkable lot of human counterfeit presentments,
                true as life, that ever greeted your eyes!</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Chambers street is one of the lines of
                demarcation in the character of Broadway. From Bowling Green to the City Hotel forms
                Character No. 1; from that to Chambers street forms No. 2; and thence to Canal No.
                3; the rest upward is the "no more beyond." I haven't time to delineate the separate
                traits of each—if we may mention such a thing as traits in Broadway; which, perhaps,
                has more of the cosmopolitan than any other street in the world.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Stewart's<ptr target="med.00982_n2"/> shop for
                dry goods has not done much for elevating the standard of architecture. It is
                difficult to say what order it is of; perhaps none at all. As you pass there of an
                evening, and see scores of young men, putting away muslins and silks, you will
                hardly help thinking that their young-man-hood might be put to some better uses.
                Stewart is horribly rigid with his clerks; as are also Seaman &amp; Muir<ptr target="med.00982_n3"/> just above, on
                the opposite side. These clerks lead a hard life indeed; and generally dwindle away
                before they have far passed thirty years.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Irving Hotel, with a single couched
                lion guarding the entrance, has somewhat innovated on the block on the north side,
                below Reade street. Here is . . . the place for showy jewelry shops. Chains, bracelets,
                blue and green stones; there, with their hundred et ceteras, you see them displayed
                in the large plate-glass windows.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Ah! that gloomy far-back building, behind those
                somber trees! The New York Hospital—the place where mangled bodies, and folks who
                fall down in fits, are taken. One shudders, if he but thinks of the agonies and
                pains daily existing there.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Broadway Theatre—with a collection of frightfully
                danbed<ptr target="med.00982_n4"/> things in gorgeous gilt frames—"painting" by courtesy called—now strikes the
                eye, particularly if it is evening. There shine the gas lamps surrounding the names
                of some thirty States, from Maine to Texas—flanked on each side by the lamps of the
                gilded drinking-houses of that region. Inside the Broadway is as near perfect as one
                can conceive a temple of the drama ought to be; but outside, the effect is none of
                the grandest. Chocolate colored plaster, and some diamond shaped panes of tinged
                glass, are the "own peculiar" of the Broadway. Moffat's new store, opposite his old
                one, has just been completed; and is as spruce and dashy as expense can make a five
                story house on a Broadway corner. On the south side of the street, along here, have
                of late grown up a number of large "halls," for exhibition purposes. You will see
                some fifteen or twenty of them when you next come to town. They have large
                panoramas, and similar pictorial exhibitions, with other things to please "the
                public eye."</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Tabernacle block, (with the exception of Moffat's corner,) stands
                just as it did years ago. The same shade at noon-day, the same tall, dingy brick
                walls, and the windows that look as if all the soap and water in the world couldn't
                divest them of a darkness like the still water of a pond in the woods, meet one as
                of old. The Society Library Building, however, has a more prosperous and frequented
                look than it used to possess; more groups chatting and laughing on the steps—more
                folks going in and out. The Carlton bar, of an evening——but I dare say you know all
                about it.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Barring a few more pretensive windows, (some new comer not being satisfied
                without "an effort" at expansion)—a change of an old stand of twenty or thirty
                years, into the possession of an intruder—the other side of Broadway, for several
                blocks, has not altered much, either. By-the-way, passing there of late my attention
                has been drawn to one of the queerest pictures I ever <hi rend="italic">did</hi> see. It is of "The Last
                Supper;" but, with a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> slight changes from the common version. Instead of the
                pathos, the Judas, and all that, the artist has made the suppers as merry as larks.
                Each has a fair damsel by his side, and a fat flagon in front of him; while a
                musical individual purveys harmony for the feast and its enjoyers! What do you think
                of it?</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Apollo Room, with the three smirking divinities up on the roof—(did <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
                ever go to dancing school there?—the room I mean, not the roof)—and all the old
                landmarks contiguous to these diggins, also remain as in the days past. Canal
                street, and the delightful odor of the gas house, ditto, ditto. But it's of not much
                use to go on. The merry little Olympic, "Tattersall's," and the Broadway House—all
                are there. You meet no striking change till you get up to Niblo's—whose lights are
                fled, and whose music is decidedly dead. Why don't they put up something there?
                There is room for some dozen splendid edifices; where now goes by the interesting
                name of Frog Pond. Some queer Circus, or something that way, is to take up its
                quarters there for the winter.</p>
