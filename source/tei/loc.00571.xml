         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00571_n100"/> was very glad indeed to hear from you in answer to my last, and you know I could not but be gratified to find your business was progressing so favorably,&#8212;<ptr target="loc.00571_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>In accordance with not only your wishes, but my own I went to Brooklyn yesterday and saw your Mother.&#8212;I found her alone, Matt<ptr target="loc.00571_n3"/> &amp; Jeff<ptr target="loc.00571_n4"/> out walking. Eddy<ptr target="loc.00571_n5"/> at church, and George<ptr target="loc.00571_n6"/> out somewhere's else I suppose. She did not remember me at first but as soon as she did she was very much pleased. I had a long talk, and settled the old $2.00 affair of Matts. I came away before she and Jeff returned. Walt, Mother says she feels first rate, is not at all sick, and I think she looks as well now as she did while I was living over there.&#8212;There is no news new Walt. The last fight, the Japenese Embassy, and the Charleston Democratic Convention, fill the papers to the exclusion of Every thing else.<ptr target="loc.00571_n7"/>&#8212;Dunn,<ptr target="loc.00571_n9"/> the ex stage driver is in Boston with that Circus Co. I think he will call upon you as I gave him your address.&#8212;If you come on here this [week] Be sure and make it your business to call and see me. Do not neglect it please Walt, for I want to see you very much. Mrs. Cooper<ptr target="loc.00571_n8"/> &amp; Robert<ptr target="loc.00571_n10"/> send their loves. Ever yours, In a Hurry! Fred.</p>
