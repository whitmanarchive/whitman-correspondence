            </opener>
            <p>I have been back home since 21st of July. I had to come back to look after my farm. The heavy rains came near 
                washing it away. Wife &amp; Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> are still up in the mountains &amp; are well. I &amp; my man live alone in the 
                old house, I am chief cook &amp; bottle washer I keep well &amp; busy, &amp; am not having a very bad time<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01172.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                after all. In a couple of weeks my grapes will be all off (only 1/2 crop this year) &amp; I shall take another holiday</p>
            <p>Hope to see you in Sept, I trust you keep well as usual. I rec'd a letter from you at Hobart which I sent on to 
                <choice><sic>Buck</sic><corr>Bucke</corr></choice>,<ptr target="n0119"/> with one from Eldridge,<ptr target="n0210"/> 
                I read Williams<ptr target="n2002"/> pamphlet on Donnelley's Reviewers<ptr target="loc.01172_n2"/> with melancholy enjoyment. It is very brilliant &amp; effective, quite equal to
                his best work I think. If he had only left out some of his mud-Epithets, and if 
                he had only not<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01172.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                claimed Montaignes Essays &amp; Burtons Melancholy for Bacon! How such a claim as that does discredit the whole business.
                I suppose the evidence that Montaigne wrote his Essays is as good as that Bacon wrote the Essays that bear his name. 
                W<hi rend="underline">m</hi> was fated to slop over in just this way, &amp; to steel his reader against him. I have as 
                yet seen no allusion to his book in the literary journals.</p>
            <p>I wish you were here to enjoy this view, &amp; this air, &amp; also my grapes &amp; peaches. Drop me a card.</p>
