                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I have long wanted to write to you, but have been shockingly
                crowded down with work, and I have nearly forty letters unanswered. Your postal of
                Monday last came duly.<ptr target="loc.03298_n1"/> Also the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Springfield Republican</hi>.<ptr target="loc.03298_n2"/> How deliciously like
                my old friend Henry Peterson is that critical exegesis
                on your lines! I shall certainly send it to Bucke that he may be convinced of the
                error of his ways by it, as I have of mine! </p>
            <p> Your poem about the Arctic snow-bird is beautiful.<ptr target="med.00762_n1"/> I
                send a slip from the Washington <hi rend="underline">Hatchet</hi>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03298.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to let you see
                your article on Shakespeare reproduced. Did I tell you (probably not) about getting
                a letter from Mr. Gibson, the Librarian of the Shakespeare Memorial Library at
                Stratford-on-Avon? This is a gorgeous stone building, all carved and paneled oak
                inside, containing a library, a reading-room, a grand hall, a museum of Shakespeare
                Memorials, etc. The librarian wrote me, very liberally asking me to send to the
                library anything I had written in favor of the Baconian theory, saying that the
                management wished to give house-room to anything related to the subject (Fact is,
                those fellows over there are beginning to feel the force of the Baconian claim. It
                is the sign of the rising of <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03298.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> the tide, and ten years ago such a request would not have been
                made.) I at once sent Mr. Gibson a copy of Bucke's book,<ptr target="loc.03298_n4"/>
                writing on the fly-leaf&#8212;"To the Stratford Memorial Library", together with
                this time, a sort of twistification of a line from Sophocles, "May the truth
                prevail!" In December last, I got a very polite and cordial acknowledgement from the
                librarian, in which he says: "Many thanks for your kind remembrance of my letter, and the welcome gift of the life of Walt Whitman,
                in which is included your letter to Dr. R. M. Bucke, referring to the Bacon and Shakespeare
                controversy, which renders the volume admissable <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03298.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to our library. I am glad to
                handle the volume, and hope, ere a few days are over, to become better acquainted
                with the personal history of your great American Poet. The beautiful portrait of the
                Poet in 1880, to Chapter 2, is exquisite and adds much to our interest in reading
                his life. His poems are not so well known here as Bryant, Longfellow or Whittier,
                but they are gradually becoming better appreciated as they are studied. Of all the
                American poets, Longfellow has the widest popularity, and his writings are better
                known than most of the English poets.".......So, you see, there you are lodged in
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03298.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> the great
                Memorial at Stratford, close by Shakespeare's tomb. </p>
            <p> I must tell you something funny. You know what I say in Bucke's book, page 91, about
                Dr. Kuno Fischer, ending with the observation that it is strange that having gone so
                far in seeing the Shakespearean connection with Bacon, he did not take the step that
                would seem inevitable. Now comes the news that he has taken the inevitable step!<ptr target="loc.03298_n5"/> Mrs Pott writes me from
                London that he has come out squarely for the Baconian theory,<ptr
                    target="loc.03298_n6"/> and was to give a course of lectures on the subject this
                winter at the <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.03298.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                University of Heidelberg, where he is professor of philosophy and literature. So it
                would seem my words were prophetic. This is the most important accession to the
                theory yet made. Dr. Fischer is a very eminent man, widely known in Europe, and his
                advocacy will carry weight. There is a string of eminent German professors who have
                also come out for the cause, notably among whom is Dr. Karl M&#252;ller of
                Stuttgard. He has translated our Appleton Morgan's "Shakespeare Myth"<ptr
                    target="loc.03298_n7"/> into German and it will have the honor of being
                published by the great house of Lanchnitz.<ptr target="loc.03298_n8"/> All this will
                be gall and wormwood <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03298.007_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> to the literary gang here who, for years, in their effort to
                suppress us, have acted like the Dragon of Wantley<ptr target="n4965"/> in his dying moments. </p>
            <p> Mrs Pott writes me that the cause grows daily in England, a number of old scholars,
                not publicly known, but men of learning and judgement, having given their adhesion,
                and the young men at Oxford and Cambridge also joining in numbers, and getting ready
                to fight for Bacon. Hooray! Meanwhile, I bide my time in the cellar. </p>
            <p> Here is something decidedly rich which I heard a couple of weeks since, and tell you
                in confidence, so as not to compromise the narrator. It is extremely <pb
                    xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.03298.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> creamy. You
                know, or you do not know, that Osgood &amp; Co,<ptr target="loc.03298_n9"/> besides
                being publishers, also run the Heliotype Company, which does beautiful work in that
                line, in reproducing maps, plans, engravings, illustrations, etc. They have an
                office here, and their agent is a Boston man, a very nice fellow, named Coolidge. I
                am interested in a little enterprise in his line which brings me into connection
                with him. The other day I was in his office, and in chatting, referring to a 
                beautifully published life of "Home-Sweet-Home" Payne<ptr target="n4964"/> by the firm, I remarked that
                Osgood got out books in splendid style. <pb xml:id="leaf005r"
                    facs="loc.03298.009_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Coolidge assented, but somewhat
                wistfully. "Why", said I, "don't you think so?" "O yes," he hastily answered,
                "but"&#8212;."But what?"&#8212;I asked, laughing. "Well," said Coolidge slowly,
                after a pause, "Osgood's a good fellow, and we all like him, but I'm afraid as a
                publisher, he's going down." "Going down!"&#8212;I repeated. "Why how's that?" "Well,"
                returned Coolidge, "I mean that he's losing his grip." "Losing his grip as a
                publisher!" I exclaimed: "Why, Coolidge, how has that happened?" "Well," he
                returned: then after a long pause, he continued briskly, "Did you ever hear <pb
                    xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc.03298.010_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of a man named
                Walt Whitman, who wrote a book called <hi rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi>?" I
                admitted that I had heard of this man, and of his book. Then he went on to tell me,
                very circumstantially, that Osgood had solicited the publication of the book, got it
                out in good style, and was selling it right along, when the District Attorney
                threatened him with prosecution, etc., etc., (you and I know all this) when he got
                scared, broke his contract and stopped the publication. "What an infernal fool!" I
                excalimed, just here. "Fool!" returned Coolidge, "I should say so! Why that was his
                chance! He <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc.03298.011_large.jpg" type="recto"/> ought
                to have told the District Attorney to go to hell, publicly defied him, and set all
                his presses to work. He'd have sold a hundred thousand copies in a month, and
                nothing could have been done to him." Then he went on to tell me that the affair
                made a great buzz, that Osgood was universally condemned for his cowardice, and
                thought to have acted dishonorably, that in consequence a blight fell upon him, and
                that he had lost his grip as a publisher for the present, and might be going down.
                "If he does go down," concluded Coolidge, <pb xml:id="leaf006v"
                    facs="loc.03298.012_large.jpg" type="verso"/> "it will all be because of his
                conduct toward Walt Whitman". </p>
            <p> Such is the outline of what Coolidge said, and considering that it was told me as to
                one who knew nothing of the matter, and by an intimate agent of the house, you may
                imagine my satisfaction. It was a real comfort to know that although we got so
                little support in the matter form "the organs of public opinion," there was a public
                feeling broad and deep enough to put the brand upon the miserable <choice>

                    <reg>peddler</reg>
                </choice> who did this mean wrong. I rejoiced exceedingly to have learned it. </p> 
            <p> Isn't it a sweet sequel? <pb xml:id="leaf007r" facs="loc.03298.013_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> Don't let Scovel<ptr target="n1049"/> print it (as the
                divvle did my note to him: Wasn't I astonished!) for I wouldn't have Coolidge
                injured in Osgood's regard for the world, though I wouldn't care a continental how
                widely it was known that a blight had fallen upon Osgood for his treatment of you,
                provided the news came without a source being specified. </p>
