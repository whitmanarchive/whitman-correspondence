            </opener>
            <p>How are you this morning.—I wish I was where I could come in and see you and do
                something for you—that has been a trouble to us, that we <choice>
                    <sic>cant</sic>
                    <corr>can't</corr>
                </choice> be of the least benefit to you now when you are ill.<ptr target="loc.00673_n2"/></p>
            <p>You dont know anything about how bad and sorry I felt about your illness</p>
            <p>You have been exceedingly kind and thoughtful dear brother to write to me, that first
                letter was very welcome I was wonderfully glad to get it, a little afraid you was
                hardly yet strong enough <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.00673.002.jpg" type="verso"/> to write.—Dear Mother<ptr target="n0705"/> too has been kind about
                writing I expect a line every day I am anxious to hear,</p>
            <p>I have not heard for eleven
                days—I do so hope to hear the good news that you are better, and are able to
                go out a little</p>
            <p>I feel glad when <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice> bright pleasant weather 
                I think maybe you will gain
                faster,—I know my dear brother you have a good deal of patience and that you
                do not easily get discouraged and that too is in your <choice>
                    <orig>favour</orig>
                    <reg>favor</reg>
                </choice>.—You have a good many friends I know, and have every attention,
                every little thing <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.00673.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                done for your comfort that can be done, do you not Walt.—Still it would seem
                better, to us, if some of us was near you.</p>
            <p>Has George<ptr target="n0700b"/> been to see you I suppose he has though</p>
            <p>And dear brother Jeffy<ptr target="n4995"/> too I know as soon as he can think
                of anything he will go to see you. I should like to hear from him and the dear
                little girls<ptr target="loc.00475_n7"/></p>
            <p>Do you remember Walt some years ago, what a bad time I had with my back (I think
                it was <choice>
                    <sic>neuralgie</sic>
                    <corr>neuralgia</corr>
                </choice> of the spine) anyway I was well only my back I could not walk three
                steps for many weeks &amp; could sit up all day, &amp; when I could walk about &amp;
                even go up &amp; down stairs I was a good deal more than half bent over &amp; I was
                bent over so nearly as bad for more than a year,—I only speak of it so you
                will know how much time will do, my back is now as strong as it ever was in the
                world</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.00673.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I do so want you to get well Walt, I shall be so happy when you are strong as ever
                again, and persons tell me you will be, a good many inquire about you.—</p>
            <p>You know your room here is always ready. I do hope when <choice><sic>it</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice>
                warm weather in June you
                will come. I remember you liked the mountain air here and I know it will be good for
                you And I have been thinking if dear Mother too could bear the journey, for it would
                seem just like home to you then, and I do not think it safe to stay in Washington
                like you did last summer, &amp; Charlie has a great wish to go
                away to the Adirodacks<ptr target="loc.00673_n6"/> &amp; other places, &amp; its a
                great bother to leave the house alone with me, &amp; I would do everything in my
                power for you, dear brother</p>
            <p>I don't know why I have not written to you before, I wish I had something cheerful to
                tell you, things are just the same here I only want you to be well again I do like
                that young fellow that is so kind to you, Peter Doyle<ptr target="n0752"/> I
                shall always remember him</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Good bye my dear brother. I send you a great deal of love<ptr target="loc.00673_n8"/></salute>
