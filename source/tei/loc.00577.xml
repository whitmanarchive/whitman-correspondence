               <salute>Dear Walt.</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>Your letter came duly to hand, we<ptr target="loc.00577_n100"/> have not answered previously because we have had nothing particular to say, nor indeed have we now any further than that the English periodicals appear to be waking up&#8212;that notice in the Saturday Review is quite a pungent one<ptr target="loc.00577_n2"/>. The praise in regard to the mechanical execution of the book is great, from that source. It is more apparent however every day that a less, pretentious Edition to sell at $1.00 must be the one to be universally sold&#8212;we approve heartily of your idea in regard to a change in this respect&#8212;the fine Ed must be put up to 1.50 more would be sold at that price than 125 we believe, because when you make a difference in price people all at once see a difference in quality which they were blind <pb facs="loc.00577.002.jpg" type="verso"/>to before<ptr target="loc.00577_n3"/>. If you make a book too good for the money&#8212;you ask for it, you degrade it at once. People <hi rend="italic">do</hi> like to pay the cost of what they buy.</p>
            <p>Still it is very evident that it was the best policy to insure the fine editions in the style in which they have appeared. It has commanded an attention and respect which we otherwise should not have obtained in certain quarters.  Have you seen the notice in the Literary Gazette&#8212;it is regular "out and outer."<ptr target="loc.00577_n4"/> As I write I am informed that the Spectator has noticed it but I have not seen it<ptr target="loc.00577_n5"/>.</p>
            <p>As soon as we get any thing worth while we will report it as an advertisement in the N.Y. papers<ptr target="loc.00577_n6"/>.</p>
            <p>About Fall we should make an extensive push in the advertisement way. We are now receiving 300 applications a day for Imprints but the orders by mail do not seem to come in much yet&#8212;<pb facs="loc.00577.003.jpg" type="recto"/>probably owing to the season of the year which is more adopted to haying than reading. We shall probably dispose of all the second Edition before the close of next month and we think that we had better point it cheaper for the next Edition, with a small Edition of the other style with the addition at 1.50.</p>
            <p>Let us hear from you further on this point&#8212;we do not think favorably of paper covers for a dollar book&#8212;nor paper covers for any kind&#8212;Let it be flexible cloth or cloth with boards.</p>
            <p>Enclosed is a list of P<gap reason="illegible"/> in England which have been furnished with Leaves of Grass</p>
            <closer rend="right"><!--The closer functions like the opener, to group together a set of information, but this time at the end of the letter. The closer may include <salute>, <signed>, <dateline>, <date>, and <name>. In some instances, date and location information may be given at the end of a letter, and you will encode it within the <dateline> tag as above, in the opener. You may also need to use the <rend> tag here, if the information is not right justified on the page.-->
