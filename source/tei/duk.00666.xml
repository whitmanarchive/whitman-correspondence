        <salute>Dear Charley,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter came last week, enclosing one from the office. I have just written 
        to the Postmaster at Washington,<ptr target="duk.00666_n1"/> asking him to forward my letters here, 
        as I suppose that can be done. How is it? Can it be done—do you know? 
        So you are to leave Washington on Thursday next—&amp; Nelly and Jeannie are also—for a New England visit—May it be a pleasant &amp; healthful &amp; happy one for all of you.
      </p>
      
      <p>In my case there is no notable amendment—&amp; not much change—I have irregular spells 
        of serious distress, pain &amp;c. in the head, full as bad as ever, sometimes lasting all day, 
        &amp; sometimes part of the day or night only, with intervals in which, (while I remain still,) 
        I feel comparatively easy—but my locomotion is about as bad as it was—last evening I thought it worse than usual—(to-day it is not)—I am not taking any medicine, nor have I talked with any doctor since I left W[ashington]—nights &amp; sleep are quite good—appetite middling—&amp;c &amp;c.—I still stay here, 
        afraid to go to Atlantic City, or any where, while I am liable every day 
        to these depressing spells—&amp; incapacitated from walking—</p>
      
      <p>We have the weather in <hi rend="italic">streaks</hi> of hot &amp; cool here—last evening it turned coldish 
        &amp; remains so this forenoon, very bright &amp; pleasant—but we had it very hot here too, some days—</p>
      
      <p>By what I see in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Ledger</hi> and N. Y. Herald<ptr target="duk.00666_n2"/> Wash[ington] items to-day, I infer that William has rec'd 
        the appointment of C[hief] C[lerk] at which I am <hi rend="italic">truly pleased</hi>—Nelly, 
        as I suppose you will see this letter, I will send you my love in it, 
        and you must take this letter the same as if written to you—I <orig><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></orig> ask you to write from W. at present in the midst of your preparations—but write me from Newport, after you get well rested &amp; settled—did you see Dr. Drinkard? &amp; did he say any thing new about my sickness or symptoms?
      </p>
      
      <p>I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs to-day—he &amp; wife are evidently having real good 
        healthy country times away there in the cool uplands of Delaware county—he is home—</p>
      
      <p>I am feeling comparatively comfortable to-day, &amp; still hope for the best—<hi rend="italic">but</hi>—Charley, 
        go in to my office a moment, before you go &amp; see if any letters—tell me if William is 
        definitely appointed—write very soon from Boston, if not before.
      </p>
