        <salute>Dear Charley,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter came last week, enclosing one from the office. I have just written 
        to the Postmaster at Washington,<ptr target="duk.00666_n1"/> asking him to forward my letters here, 
        as I suppose that can be done. How is it? Can it be done&#8212;do you know? 
        So you are to leave Washington on Thursday next&#8212;&amp; Nelly and Jeannie are also&#8212;for a New England visit&#8212;May it be a pleasant &amp; healthful &amp; happy one for all of you.
      </p>
      
      <p>In my case there is no notable amendment&#8212;&amp; not much change&#8212;I have irregular spells 
        of serious distress, pain &amp;c. in the head, full as bad as ever, sometimes lasting all day, 
        &amp; sometimes part of the day or night only, with intervals in which, (while I remain still,) 
        I feel comparatively easy&#8212;but my locomotion is about as bad as it was&#8212;last evening I thought it worse than usual&#8212;(to-day it is not)&#8212;I am not taking any medicine, nor have I talked with any doctor since I left W[ashington]&#8212;nights &amp; sleep are quite good&#8212;appetite middling&#8212;&amp;c &amp;c.&#8212;I still stay here, 
        afraid to go to Atlantic City, or any where, while I am liable every day 
        to these depressing spells&#8212;&amp; incapacitated from walking&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>We have the weather in <hi rend="italic">streaks</hi> of hot &amp; cool here&#8212;last evening it turned coldish 
        &amp; remains so this forenoon, very bright &amp; pleasant&#8212;but we had it very hot here too, some days&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>By what I see in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Ledger</hi> and N. Y. Herald<ptr target="duk.00666_n2"/> Wash[ington] items to-day, I infer that William has rec'd 
        the appointment of C[hief] C[lerk] at which I am <hi rend="italic">truly pleased</hi>&#8212;Nelly, 
        as I suppose you will see this letter, I will send you my love in it, 
        and you must take this letter the same as if written to you&#8212;I <orig status="unremarkable"><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></orig> ask you to write from W. at present in the midst of your preparations&#8212;but write me from Newport, after you get well rested &amp; settled&#8212;did you see Dr. Drinkard? &amp; did he say any thing new about my sickness or symptoms?
      </p>
      
      <p>I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs to-day&#8212;he &amp; wife are evidently having real good 
        healthy country times away there in the cool uplands of Delaware county&#8212;he is home&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I am feeling comparatively comfortable to-day, &amp; still hope for the best&#8212;<hi rend="italic">but</hi>&#8212;Charley, 
        go in to my office a moment, before you go &amp; see if any letters&#8212;tell me if William is 
        definitely appointed&#8212;write very soon from Boston, if not before.
      </p>
