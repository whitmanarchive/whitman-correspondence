                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> A happy New Year to you, &#38; many returns of the same. I was right glad to get your
                letter &#38; to know your eyes were so much better. I feel certain that if you eat
                little or no meat you will be greatly the gainer. It will not do to take
                in sail in ones activities &#38;c, unless he takes in sail in his food also.</p>
            <p> We are all pretty well here <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01153.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> this winter so far. I have just sent off the copy for my new <choice>
                    <abbr>vol</abbr><expan>volume</expan></choice>: think I shall stick to "Signs &#38; Seasons" for the title, as this
                covers all the articles.<ptr target="loc.01153_n1"/> Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/>
                sent me his essay on the <hi rend="underline">Poet as Craftsman</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02599_n1"/> I liked it
                pretty well: what he has to say about you is excellent. He wanted my opinion about
                the argument of the essay, so I told him that I never felt like quarreling with a
                real poet about his form: let him take the form he can use best; any form is good if
                it holds good poetry <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01153.005_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> &#38; any form is bad that holds bad poetry. I would not have
                    Tennyson,<ptr target="n0625"/> or Longfellow<ptr target="n0367"/> or Burns<ptr
                    target="loc.01153_n2"/> use other forms than they do. If a man excells in prose
                he is pretty sure to use prose. Coleridge<ptr target="n3049"/> is greater in prose than in poetry. Poe is
                greater in poetry than in prose. Carlyle<ptr target="n0139"/> tried the poetic form
                &#38; gave it up. </p>  
            <p> I hope you will keep well &#38; that I will see you again before long. How much I
                wish you were here to eat a New Years dinner <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.01153.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> with us. I wrote to Herbert
                Gilchrist the other day.<ptr target="n0262"/> These must be dark days for he &#38;
                    Grace.<ptr target="n0890"/> To me a black shadow seems to have settled on all
                England since I read of the death of Mrs Gilchrist.<ptr target="loc.02182_n1"/> I
                wish you would send me by mail or by Express those books of Emerson,<ptr
                    target="loc.01149_n3"/> the essays &#38; the miscellanies. I want to use them. I
                am going to re-read Emerson, &#38; see how he strikes me now. </p>
