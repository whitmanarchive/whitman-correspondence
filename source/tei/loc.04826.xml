                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A heavy snow storm outside (afternoon) &#38; the wind whistling with rising gusts &#38; falls.&#8212;I wonder
                how the weather is with you, and how you are yourself.</p>
            <p>I was sorry to see in your last PC. to Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> that you were suffering from physical 
                depression,<ptr target="loc.04826_n2"/> &#38; had
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01960_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                more or less suffering all the time. I fear that it was so in some degree during most of the time that I was
                in Camden. I often think of you in your loneliness &#38; suffering. But it is always an encouragement
                &#38; stimulus to me to remember how serenely &#38; patiently you bear it, &#38; of your constant
                loving kindness &#38; thought for others.&#8212;In thinking of you, &#38; in my own worries, I have to
                fall back always on the belief that "it is all right" if we could only see it.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01961_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> came here on Wednesday afternoon &#38; stayed till the last train. He told me 
                that he had written to
                you</p>
            <p>Next day I was in Bolton, &#38; called for a few minutes on Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/> at his office, &#38; spent 
                half an hour later
                with Johnston Both were quite well &#38; in good spirits</p>
            <p>I have not been able to call on any of the others&#8212;partly because the weather has been wet &#38; stormy.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01962_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I am practically clear of my cold again.&#8212;I am not quite acclimatised &#38; hardened yet, but shall be
                so in time</p>
            <p>I cannot write much at present, but I do not want the mail to go without a line or two of loving
                sympathy &#38; good will.</p>
            <p>Please to give my affectionate regards to M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Davis<ptr target="n6113"/>
