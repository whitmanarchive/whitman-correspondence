                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your two post cards of March 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi> &#38; March 10<hi
                    rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.04704_n2"/> addressed to Dr.
                    Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> were received together yesterday&#8212;along with
                one from Warry.<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/></p>
            <p>We were very pleased to receive them &#38; to compare them, so as to arrive at a fair
                idea of your condition. We were very glad to note in the later one (March 10th) that
                there was "a suspicion of shade of betterment" in your <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01130.jpg" type="verso"/> condition. We hope that the improvement
                is now more pronounced, as Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> was "quite convinced" it
                would be, &#38; look for a better report when the weather improves.</p>
            <p>It affects us very deeply that, in the midst of your weakness &#38; suffering, &#38;
                your other correspondence &#38; writing, you are so constantly mindful of us, &#38;
                so kind in writing to us.&#8212;What <hi rend="underline">can</hi> we say in return?
                but that our deepest gratitude &#38; our heart's best love &#38; sympathy are with
                you always.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01131.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I wish that we could <choice>
                    <sic>shew</sic>
                    <corr>show</corr>
                </choice> them better than by mere letter writing, &#38; by sending such papers
                &#38; magazines as are likely to interest you. But since even these please you, we
                shall continue to send them, as poor tokens of our deepest affection.</p>
            <p>We have not only cause for gratitude to you for all that your books have done for
                us,&#8212;&#38; will continue to do for us as we more deeply explore them, &#38;
                assimilate their teaching &#38; spirit&#8212;&#38; for the <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01132.jpg" type="verso"/> glad wonderful gift of your personal
                affection &#38; constant, ever-thoughtful kindness, (so deeply enhancing the
                personal appeal of your books too), but for the warm &#38; ever widening comradeship
                &#38; affection which comes to us through your influence. Love &#38; gratitude to
                you evermore.</p>
            <p>Surely this "ever widening commune of brothers &#38; lovers"<ptr
                    target="loc.04704_n3"/> is destined to develop to unprecedented extents.
                Wherever the songs of Burns<ptr target="n0127"/> are sung Scotchmen meet together as brothers, in a
                common spirit of patriotism.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01133.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>But when <hi rend="underline">your</hi> influence &#38; fame reach their height, not
                Americans only, but your readers in every country will feel themselves linked
                together in a common bond &#38; a common love.</p>
            <p>But, outside this acknowledged brotherhood, your influence will permeate further
                still;&#8212;as in small beginnings it does now. For in our daily lives it makes
                itself felt in all our dealings with others. Johnston feels it in his professional
                work, &#38; I, too, in mine. Brought daily into contact with numbers <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01134.jpg" type="verso"/> of others, we learn to
                regard them more &#38; more in your own spirit,&#8212;&#38; are ourselves happier
                thereby.</p> 
            <milestone unit="undeclared" rend="horbar-short-center"/>
            <p>I am glad to learn that you "are getting on fairly with proofs of 2<hi
                rend="underline">nd</hi> Annex,"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> &#38; can understand how 
                relieved you will be when you get it fairly out of your hands. And to us its interest will be very great
                indeed.</p> 
            <p>I turn again &#38; again, with inexhaustible interest &#38; delight, to the wonderful
                preface to your first edition, (illustrating &#38; harmonizing so well, <pb
                    xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01135.jpg" type="recto"/> in every word, with all
                your after performance.) And I cannot but look forward with tender swelling joy
                &#38; pride &#38; love to your latest confirmation of the "message from the heavens"
                of which you have been the mouthpiece&#8212;"nor once losing nor faith nor ecstacy
                in Him."<ptr target="loc.04704_n4"/></p>
            <p>From the poems which have already appeared, (as in Lippincott's<ptr target="loc.07891_n3"/>) I quite believe
                Traubel's words (in a letter to me) that they will <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01136.jpg" type="verso"/> detract nothing from previous years &#38;
                work," but will <hi rend="underline">add</hi> to them, &#38; that the book "is
                saturated with divine flavors."&#8212;</p>
            <p>But I must close. I intended to write to Traubel by this mail, but will ask you to
                convey my affectionate regards to him instead.</p>
            <p>I expect Johnston &#38; Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> here tomorrow afternoon (Sat.
                4) if the weather is favourable. In that case Johnston will post this for me on his
                return to Bolton (Post from <hi rend="underline">here</hi> tomorrow night too late
                for mail).</p>
            <p>With best love to you always</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
