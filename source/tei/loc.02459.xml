            </opener>

            <p>The American mail this morning brought me three most welcome letters&#8212;one from
                Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/>, one from your dear niece Jessie Whitman<ptr
                    target="n1055"/>, &#38; best of all another kind postcard from <hi
                    rend="underline">you</hi><ptr target="loc.02459_n2"/>, for which I thank you
                very heartily&#8212;</p>

            <p>From it I was rejoiced to learn that you were (on Jan 5th) apparently so much better
                in health&#8212;"comfortable with me still writing a little for
                publication"&#8212;and in such good spirits.</p>

            <p>I sincerely trust that this improvement will continue</p>

                    target="n0119"/> in which the Dr said that he had dislocated his left shoulder
                but was getting on all right with it. He also <choice>
                    <sic>shewed</sic>
                    <corr>showed</corr>
                </choice> me the letter he is sending you by this mail, in which he pays a
                deservedly high tribute to our mutual &#38; much-loved friend Fred Wild<ptr
                    target="n5000"/></p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02459.005.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>In a letter to me Fred says that he takes our gift of L of G<ptr
                    target="loc.02459_n3"/> as a token &#38; a further Link of Love between us. He
                also says:&#8212;"I have sent my warmest love to W.W. by Wallace. Do you also
                remember me. I pray I may become worthy of being one of his friends &#38; lovers."
                This desire of Fred's I gladly forward to you for a more loyal &#38; true hearted
                friend than he man never had.</p>

                />, which I think will interest you</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02459.006.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>Herbert Gilchrist says (on Jan 5th) that he "hoped to see you in a couple of weeks"
                &#38; I trust you had a good time together</p>

            <p>J.W.W. has received the paper you sent (<hi rend="underline">Once a Week</hi> I think
                it is[)] &#38; thanks you for it</p>

            <p>Our second "glum" treat comes off tonight&#8212;</p>

            <p>The frost, wh. seemed to be going when I last wrote has returned in all its severity
                &#38; we have had more snow.</p>

            <p>This has been a glorious day here&#8212;hard frost, &#38; snow with brilliant
                sunshine &#38; blue sky. J.W.W. &#38; F.W. intended going for a delightful walk in
                Rivington &#38; much do I regret that my professional duties have prevented my
                accompanying them.</p>

            <p>Again expressing the hope that you are keeping better &#38; with kindest regards to
                all your houselhold &#38; best love to yourself</p>
