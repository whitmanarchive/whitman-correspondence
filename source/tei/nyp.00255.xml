                <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I received your letter of Sunday week, Jan. 26—Mother, I hope that lameness in
                the wrist is better by this time.<ptr target="nyp.00255_n1"/> There is no news to write you this
                time—I have heard that old Mrs. Mix got through safe to Brooklyn the next
                    day—<ptr target="nyp.00255_n2"/> I
                looked for Jeff, but he didn't come—<ptr target="nyp.00255_n3"/> When you write, tell
                me how Jeff is—</p>

            <p>I suppose you have had a great change in the weather in Brooklyn—we have
                here—for several days past, it has been thawing &amp; melting—Here in
                the office, it is the same old story—it is now about 12 o'clock—the
                Attorney Gen'l. &amp; Ashton<ptr target="nyp.00255_n4"/> have gone to the Supreme Court—they go most
                every day now from 11 till 2—&amp; I have little or nothing to do a good deal
                of the time when they are away—</p>

            <p>Mother, write whether Jeff got the books, for himself &amp; Dr. Ruggles—<ptr target="nyp.00255_n5"/>write how Hattie is—Well, the
                sun is shining, &amp; as I look out this morning on the Potomac, I see the ice is
                broke up, &amp; the river is all open—I hope we shall have but little more
                cold weather—I have not had a very agreeable winter—I have not had a
                satisfactory room &amp; arrangements—I think I shall look around &amp; get
                one more suitable—</p>

            <p>Mother, do you still have the office partly in your house—there in the long
                room?</p>

            <p>Sometimes I feel as though I want to come home for about a week—I think it
                quite likely I shall come before long—I should not be able to stay longer than
                a week—I will tell you though, in time—</p>

            <p>Well, mother dear, I believe that is all this time. Give my love to George, &amp;
                Jeff &amp; Mat.</p>
