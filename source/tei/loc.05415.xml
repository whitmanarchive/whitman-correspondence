         <p>Your letter was received this morning, I was glad that you arrived safely in Washington.
            After I left you on Monday, I went to see the young lady, that I spoke to you of, that
            had been to Atlantic City, and I asked her, what kind of a place it was to have a quiet,
            nice time, and she said very good, that the <choice>
               <orig>Doctors</orig>
               <reg>Doctor's</reg>
            </choice> house was the nearest the ocean, and that there would be a good walk to the
            beach from the house this year, and there is always a good 
               breeze, and she said that if you had a room <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
               facs="loc_gk.01408_large.jpg" type="verso"/> fronting the ocean it was splendid. They
            go down the middle of June.</p>
         <p>I rather think you would like it. As for coming to Camden, come right away if you can,
            plenty of room you know, and no doubt we will get enough to eat Aunt Libbie went away
            this morning. I had a letter from Mary <choice>
               <orig>to day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice>, she wanted to know more about Mamy's death, I am going to write very soon to both Hannah and her, I have not found
            time yet to write all that I want to say, that is a satisfactory letter to them.</p>
         <p>We had a line from Jeff</p>
         <p>George is well and busy</p>
            <p>Hope this will find you
            
               <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_gk.01409_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            feeling better. You might just send a line when you will be here. Love from all</p>
