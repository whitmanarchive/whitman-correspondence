            <p>I am reading Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales"<ptr target="n4173"/> over again&#8212;have not looked at
                them for at least 25 years&#8212;did not think they were so genuine and good as I
                find them now to be. We had no <choice>
                    <sic>clergiman</sic>
                    <corr>clergyman</corr>
                </choice> this morning and I have just come in from officiating&#8212;reading
                prayers, bible, sermon &#38;c. Since coming from chapel I have spent half an hour
                (as I often do) running over "November Boughs"<ptr target="n3999"/> "The Voice of the Rain," for
                instance, one of the most exquisite parables in the English, or any other language.
                "Robert Burns," I think, a marvellous piece of criticism. "Last of the War Cases"
                one of your most touching pieces, and so on turning the leaves and thinking and
                dreaming.</p>
            <p>I thought that by this time I should have been able to say something definite about
                my jaunt east, but I cannot. Wm Gurd<ptr
                    target="n4284"/> has been in N.Y. since Tuesday morning. <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00427.jpg" type="verso"/> but so far I have heard
                no word from him&#8212;I fear something is wrong but cannot think what it
                is&#8212;probably it is nothing serious and when I do hear in a few days more the
                hitch may have been then got over. I still hope I may leave here say about two weeks
                from tomorrow (it may possibly be sooner) but I cannot tell whether I shall go
                direct to Philadelphia or to N.Y. first.</p>
            <p>Our wet weather still continues, it has rained nearly every day since Sept.
                26&#8212;the last few days snow with the rain so that the ground has been white at
                times I look for a fine long "Indian Summer" after all this wet, raw, and cold
                weather.</p>
            <p>The "Complete Works"<ptr target="n6137"/> takes time, a lot of time, but that is all right&#8212;<hi
                    rend="underline">take time</hi>&#8212;enough of it, and have it <hi
                    rend="underline">right</hi>&#8212;it is worth taking pains about&#8212;it will
                be a standard book for many a day&#8212;to many and many it will be a sacred, an
                altogether priceless volume&#8212;a bible of the bibles&#8212;a resum&#233; of them
                all.</p>
