                <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I send you photographs of my eldest and youngest children I wish I had some worth
                sending of the other two. That of myself done in 1850 is a copy of a daguerrotype.
                The recent one was taken just a week or so before I broke down in my long illness
                &amp; when I was struggling against a terrible sense of inward prostration, so it
                has not my natural expression, but I think you will like to have it rather than
                none, &amp; the weather here is too gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one
                if I were to try again&#8212;Your few words lifted a heavy weight off me. Very few
                they are, dear friend: but knowing that I may give to every word you speak its
                fullest truest <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02860.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                meaning, the more I brood over them the sweeter do they taste. Still I am not as
                happy &amp; content as I thought I should be if I could only know my words reached
                you &amp; were welcome to you,&#8212;but restless, anxious, impatient, looking so
                wistfully towards the letters each morning&#8212;above <gap reason="illegible" extent="8 words"/> to come&#8212;to come &amp; see if you feel happy beside me:
                no more this painful struggle to put myself into words, but to let what I am &amp;
                all my life speak to you. Only so can you judge whether I am indeed the woman
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">capable of rising to
                    the full</supplied> height of great destiny, of justifying &amp; fulfilling your
                grand <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">thoughts of
                    women.</supplied> And see <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">my faults, flaws, shortcomings too, dear Friend. I
                    feel</supplied>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02860.003.jpg" type="recto"/> an earnest wish you
                should do this so that there may be the broad unmovable foundation-rock of perfect
                truth &amp; candour for our love. I do not fear.&#8212;I believe in a large all
                accepting because all comprehending love, a boundless faith in growth &amp;
                developmenet&#8212;in your judging "not as the judge judges but as the sunshine
                falling around me."&#8212;To have you in the midst of us! we clustered round you,
                shone upon, vivified, strengthened by your presence&#8212;surrounding you with an
                atmosphere of love &amp; cheerful life. </p>

            <p>When I wrote you in Nov. I was in lodging in London, having just accomplished the
                difficult task of finding a <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02860.004.jpg" type="verso"/> house for us in London, where rents are so <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">high. And I have</supplied>
                succeeded better than <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">I
                    anticipated,</supplied> for we find this a comfortable dear little
                home&#8212;small indeed but not so small as to interfere with health or comfort, and
                at rent that I may safely undertake. My Husband<!-- <ptr target="loc.02860_n1"/> --> was taken from us
                too young to be able to<supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">
                    have made any provision for his children. I have a little of my
                    own&#8212;about</supplied>&gt; £80 a year; &amp; for the rest depend upon my
                Mother whose only surviving child I am. And she by nature generous &amp;
                self-denying as well <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">as
                    prudent, has never made</supplied> anything but a pleasure of this &amp; as long
                as she was able to see to her own affairs, was such a capital manager that she used
                to spare me about £150 out of an income of £350. But now though she
                retains her faculties in a wonderful degree for her years (just upon 86), she is no
                longer able <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02860.005.jpg" type="recto"/> to do this
                &amp; has put the management of the whole into my hands. And I, feeling that she
                needs and ought to have now an easier scale of expenditure at Colne, have to manage
                a little more cleverly still to make a less sum serve for us. But I succeed
                capitally dear friend&#8212;do not want a better home, never get behind hand &amp;
                find it no hardship, but quite the contrary to have to spend a good <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned transcription">deal of time &amp; pains in
                    domestic</supplied> management. And then, just to help me through at the right
                moment dear Per<!-- <ptr target="loc.02860_n2"/> --> obtained in November a good
                opening in some large copper &amp; iron mining &amp; smelting works in South Wales
                at a salary upon which he can comfortably live <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02860.006.jpg" type="verso"/> &amp; he likes his work
                well&#8212;writes very cheerfully&#8212;lodges in a farm house in the midst of grand
                scenery, within a walk of the sea. So this enables me to give the girls a turn in
                education, for hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine. And I chose this
                part because there is a capital day school for them handy. And Herby<!-- <ptr target="loc.02860_n3"/> --> walks in to the best drawing <gap reason="illegible" extent="several words"/>
                <!-- Comparing the words transcribed to the space of unreadable text in the manuscript, it appears that Harned omitted some words here.  -->
                &amp; is very diligent &amp; happy at his work. His bent is so unmistakably strong.
                It was well I have had to be so busy this autumn &amp; winter, dear Walt, for I
                suffered keenly, sometimes overwhelmingly, through the delay in my letters' reaching
                you. What caused it? And when did you get the Sep. &amp; Oct. letter &amp; did you
                get the two copies that I, baffled &amp; almost despairing, sent off in Nov.? </p>
