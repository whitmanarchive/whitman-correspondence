                <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I send you photographs of my eldest<ptr target="n2000"/> and youngest<ptr target="n0261"/>
                children I wish I had some worth sending of the other two. 
                That of myself done in 1850 is a copy of a daguerrotype.
                The recent one was taken just a week or so before I broke down in my long illness
                &amp; when I was struggling against a terrible sense of inward prostration, so it
                has not my natural expression, but I think you will like to have it rather than
                none, &amp; the weather here is too gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one
                if I were to try again&#8212;Your few words lifted a heavy weight off me. Very few
                they are, dear friend: but knowing that I may give to every word you speak its
                fullest truest 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.00088.jpg" type="verso"/>
                meaning, the more I brood over them the sweeter do they taste. Still I am not as
                happy &amp; content as I thought I should be if I could only know my words reached
                you &amp; were welcome to you,&#8212;but restless, anxious impatient, looking so
                wistfully towards the letters each morning&#8212;above all longing, longing so for
                you to come&#8212;to come &amp; see if you feel happy beside me: no more this painful 
                struggle to put myself into words; but to let what I am &amp; all my life speak to 
                you. Only so can you judge whether I am indeed the woman capable of rising to the full 
                height of great destiny, of justifying &amp; fulfilling your grand thoughts of women. 
                And see my faults flaws shortcomings too dear Friend. I feel a
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00087.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                an earnest wish you should do this so that there may be the broad unmovable foundation&#8212;rock 
                of perfect truth &amp; <choice><orig>candour</orig><reg>candor</reg></choice> for our love.
                I do not fear.&#8212;I believe in a large 
                all accepting because all comprehending love, a boundless faith in growth &amp; development&#8212;in 
                your judging "not as the judge judges but as the sunshine falling around 
                me."<ptr target="loc.01823_n2"/>&#8212;To 
                have you in the midst of us! we clustered round you shone upon, vivified, strengthened 
                by your presence: surrounding you with an atmosphere of love &amp; cheerful life. </p>
            <p>When I wrote you in Nov.<ptr target="loc.02860_n5"/> I was in lodgings in London
                having just accomplished the difficult task of finding a 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00086.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                house for us in London where rents are so high. And I have succeeded better than I 
                anticipated for we find this a comfortable dear little home&#8212;small indeed but 
                not so small as to interfere with health or comfort &amp; at rent that I may safely 
                undertake. My Husband<ptr target="loc.02860_n1"/> was taken from us too young to be 
                able to have made any provision for his children. I have a little of my own&#8212;about 
                &#163;80 a year: &amp; for the rest depend upon my Mother<ptr target="upa.00174_n4"/> whose only living child 
                I am. And she by nature generous &amp; self denying as well as prudent has never made 
                anything but a pleasure of this &amp; as long as she was able to see to her own affairs, 
                was such a capital manager that she used to spare me about &#163;150 out of an income of 
                &#163;350. But now though she retains her faculties in a wonderful degree for her years 
                (just upon 86), she is no longer able 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_cb.00034.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                to do this &amp; has put the management of the whole into my hands. And I, feeling that 
                she needs and ought to have now, an easier scale of expenditure at Colne, have to manage 
                a little more cleverly still to make a less sum serve for us. But I succeed capitally 
                dear friend&#8212;do not want a better home, never get behind hand, &amp; find it no 
                hardship, but quite the contrary to have to spend a good deal of time &amp; pains in 
                domestic management. And then just to help me through at the right moment dear Per 
                obtained in November a good opening in some large copper &amp; iron mining &amp; smelting 
                works in South Wales at a salary upon which he can comfortably live 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_cb.00035.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                &amp; he likes his work well&#8212;writes very cheerfully&#8212;lodges in a farm house in 
                the midst of grand scenery, within a walk of the sea. So this enables me to give the girls<ptr target="upa.00174_n2"/> 
                a turn in education, for hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine. And I chose 
                this part because there is a capital day school for them handy. And Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> 
                walks in to the best drawing school in London, &amp; is very diligent &amp; happy at his work. 
                His bent is so unmistakably strong. It was well I have had to be so busy this autumn &amp; 
                winter, dear Walt, for I suffered keenly, sometimes overwhelmingly, through the delay in my 
                letters reaching you. What caused it? And when did you get the Sep.<ptr target="loc.02860_n6"/>
                &amp; Oct.<ptr target="n5002d"/> letter &amp; did you get the two copies that I, baffled &amp; 
                almost despairing sent of the Nov. one<ptr target="loc.02860_n7"/>?</p>
