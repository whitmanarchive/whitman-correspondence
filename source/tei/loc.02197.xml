            </opener>
            <p>It is a long time since I have heard from you or word of you: though I have had one
                short note from Ernest Rhys, it is true, who spoke of you; &#38; of your being
                somewhat under the weather.</p>
            <p>We all liked your brief letter about the President&#8212;&#38; our Friend&#8212;Mr.
                    Forman<ptr target="n0240"/> spoke of it the other evening as "very nice."</p>
            <p>It seemed to me to <choice><orig>eminate</orig><reg>emanate</reg></choice> from someone who felt pretty brisk.</p>
            <p>You find E. Rhys<ptr target="loc.03310_n1"/> a good fellow&#8212;I am heartily glad
                he is getting on so well in the States&#8212;at least he seems to be entering into
                the fun of a winter there.</p>
            <p>Last Friday evening I created a chalk &#38; charcoal portrait of Buxton Forman: he
                was delightful with it &#38; so was his wife, for whom it was a birthday present. He
                has a good characteristic head and I enjoyed making it very much.</p>
            <p>Once a week H.B. Forman is Clerk-in-Waiting at the General Post Office &#38; on those
                evenings in comfortable office lit with electric light I made the portrait.</p>
            <p>I am in the evening now planning out this large reception w 33 friends to see your
                portrait, that I spoke of in my last letter.</p>

            <p>If any names &#38; addresses of friends occur to you, that you would like me to ask,
                send them in your next. I have already got a good many of your friends' addresses
                but the <hi rend="underline">last batch</hi> of subscribers through the <hi
                    rend="underline">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> I have <hi rend="underline">not</hi>
                got. Mrs. Rosamund Powell (a friend of L. Morgan Brown's)<ptr target="n3176"/> sends
                (&#163;3) through me in this letter her annual subscription (free will offering) to
                you. Let me know if you get this all-right?</p>
            <p>Give my kind rememberances to Morse,<ptr target="n0862"/> when you are writing, I expect to show his bust
                along with my others works at this reception in April.</p>
            <p>Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/> is well.</p>
            <p>Mont S.<ptr target="n0910"/> has been very ill as you must have heard.</p>
