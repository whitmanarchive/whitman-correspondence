               <p>I was glad to hear by your postal that you are getting along without an increase of
                   suffering. I wish that we all were near you, if so be that we might make an
                   occasional hour brighter for you &#38; contribute to your exterior comforts. I see no
                   time to be fixed for our return. Alys<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/> proposes to go to
                   Bryn Mawr College in September &#38; then will visit you. She will return to us if all
                   is well in June 1890 with her diploma in her pocket.</p>
               <p>She, with her mother,<ptr target="n6170"/> a niece &#38; myself have been

                   the melancholy skies of London with its "pea soup" smoky

               <p>So I have not much to tell. Yet it is fun to be in the midst of this great fermenting

                    <salute>Dear W. W.</salute> 
                </opener>
                <p>With yr welcome card<ptr target="loc.02996_n2"/> came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley,<ptr
                    target="n4318"/> accepting my MS. "Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity." He is
                    going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants me to cut
                    out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are
                    essential,&#8212;guess
                    I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they
                    are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard&#8212;says "it wd
                    be a vast pity if the book were to fall through," owing to my obstinacy I suppose he
                    means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.</p>
                <p>I too have a terrific cold in head. Am <hi rend="underline">deaf</hi> in one ear
                    temporarily, through sitting by open window (necessarily) where I work. But it is
                    nothing. Wax in ear only.</p>
                <p>We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank
                    you for the news fr. O'C. the Transcripts<ptr target="loc.02996_n1"/> are so thin I am ashamed to send 'em half the time. But it
                    is little trouble, &#38; you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances to
                    Traubel &#38;c. It does one good to think of Dr. Bucke.
                    <hi rend="underline">One</hi> well man at least, ha, ha, thank God for 'em those hearty
                    "fellers." I take great delight in dogs for same reason.</p>
