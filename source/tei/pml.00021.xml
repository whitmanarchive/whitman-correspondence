                <salute>My dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Although your letter I see has the N. Y. post office stamp, Mar. 25, I have only just
                rec'd it, (2 o'clock Wednesday P.M.)—I have talked with Thomas Harlan<ptr target="pml.00021_n3"/>—he treated me very
                well. My impression is, there is little or no chance of getting Congress to pass, at
                this time, a special resolution or law putting the ruffles on the list of
                exempts—There is no Committee of Ways &amp; Means yet appointed in the H[ouse]
                of R[epresentatives]—True, any member could offer such a Bill, &amp; if it had
                powerful influence, they <hi rend="italic">might</hi> suspend the rules &amp; pass
                it—but there are too many, both in House &amp; Senate, who would almost
                certainly object—one objection would be that ruffles are matters of extra
                ornament &amp;c. &amp;c. and ought to pay a tax, if any thing does<ptr target="pml.00021_n4"/>—</p>

            <p>Still, I will try what I can do—I will see a few of the members,
                forthwith—I have one in my mind, I think may be the best one I can get to
                offer a Bill, &amp; if he is willing, we will try it on—Had I known it when
                the Committee &amp; House were cooking the Bill, I have no doubt I could have got it
                put in with the ¶ including shirt-bosoms, &amp;c.—But that's poor
                consolation.</p>

            <p>There is nothing new or important with me. I am well as usual, &amp; working the
                same, (not much.) Love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all.</p>
