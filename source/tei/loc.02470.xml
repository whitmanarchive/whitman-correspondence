            <p>Sitting here on the evening of Good Friday&#8212;a general holiday&#8212;I thought I
                    w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> give myself the pleasure of sending you a line or
                two.</p>
            <p>This morning I recd a letter from J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> inviting me to spend
                the afternoon with him &#38; enclosing a facsimile of your kind p.c. of the 14<hi

                to his "affectionate fervid letter of Mar 3<hi rend="underline">rd</hi>"<ptr target="loc.02470_n2"/> which you had "read twice and absorbed" pleased him
                greatly.</p>
            <p>I have just returned from his house where our mutual friend Wentworth Dixon<ptr target="loc.02465_n4"/>&#8212;one <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02470.002.jpg"

                across the deep blue empyrean. At times the entire sky became overcast &#38; we had
                blinding showers of snow &#38; sleet which were swept along by the high wind like
                flying wraiths <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02470.003.jpg" type="recto"/> or

            <p>On the 25<hi rend="underline">th</hi> the Bolton International Club had a "Whitman
                Evening" when Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> read a short paper &#38; selections
                from Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> Oration<ptr target="loc.04697_n2"/> upon you.
                The reading provoked a good deal of criticism&#8212;some of it very shallow&#8212;to
                which Fred replied in a vigorous table speech. I also took part in the discussion,
                read extracts from <hi rend="underline">L. of G</hi> &#38; <choice>

                the flags of different nations&#8212;English, French, German, Swiss &#38;c. Fred
                also exhibited his just finished oil painting of an American mail steamer ploughing
                her way through the moonlit <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02470.004.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> heaving waters of the Atlantic. The picture wh' is really a fine
                one was much admired.</p>
            <p>On Monday evg last we had another Whitman reading at the College &#38; we anticipate
                a great treat upon Ap 10<hi rend="underline">th</hi> when J.W.W. gives us his
