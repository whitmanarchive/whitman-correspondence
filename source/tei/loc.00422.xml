               <salute>Dear brother Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The enclosed $25 is from my old friend Joseph P. Davis<ptr target="loc.00422_n1"/> who is Engineering down in Peru. Although he is far away yet he does not forget home. I have written him in some of my letters what you were doing, with short extracts from your letters.</p>
         <p>Well Walt it looks as if we had met rather a bad reverse in the West. If Rosecrans<ptr target="loc.00422_n2"/> is whipped I should hardly think that the United States was large enough to contain the infernal quacks that administer the military arm of our government. I suppose their is at least 30 000 men <hi rend="italic">nibbling</hi> around in Kansas and other parts west. Matters that would tumble of their own weight <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad.00383_large.jpg" type="verso"/>if the army in front of Rosecrans was <choice><sic>thouroughly</sic><corr>thoroughly</corr></choice> whipped. Tis awful to think of. I mailed you a letter from George a few days since, did you get it.</p>
         <p>Mother is <choice><abbr>abt</abbr><expan>about</expan></choice> the same as usual. I think she fails somewhat. I suppose not more than we must expect however. Mattie and the babies are quite well. Hattie is getting to be quite a girl, and the little one is also getting to be quite a youngster. Jess is <choice><abbr>abt</abbr><expan>about</expan></choice> the same, he is not well. He needs good living more than anything I think. Andrew I suppose Mother wrote you about  I think that it is unfortunate that he should be so <choice><sic>humbuged</sic><corr>humbugged</corr></choice> by the "Italian Dr."<ptr target="loc.00422_n3"/> but I suppose he would not otherwise have tried to get well at all  <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_ad.00384_large.jpg" type="recto"/>The Dr. <choice><sic>requirs</sic><corr>requires</corr></choice> him to pay $180 in 3 installments in <hi rend="italic">advance</hi>. He has paid $46 and is now living his 15 days at the "<choice><sic>Foriegn</sic><corr></corr></choice> Dr's" as a <choice><sic>prepairing</sic><corr>preparing</corr></choice> course, then he is to take certain baths. The whole thing in my opinion is one of the biggest of humbugs. However if Andrew <choice><sic>believs</sic><corr>believes</corr></choice> in it I suppose it is best to bolster him up in his beliefs.</p>
            <p>I shall write you again [in] a few days sending you some more money. till then good bye</p>
