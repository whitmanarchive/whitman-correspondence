                <salute> Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Again am I your debtor for the dear good letter you sent me<ptr target="loc.02532_n2"/> 
                &#38; wh. I duly received yesterday morning. My heart's best gratitude to you for
                it. It was indeed welcomed. Thank you also for the second letter of Dr B's<ptr
                    target="n0119"/> wh, you kindly enclosed<ptr target="loc.02532_n3"/>&#8212;We
                are glad to have your endorsement of Dr B's opinion of our dear friend Wallace,<ptr
                    target="n6121"/> for he is indeed a splendid fellow.<pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.02532.002_large.jpg" type="recto"/> But do you what he has written to
                me in reply to that letter (which I sent on to him)? He says&#8212;"'Splendid
                fellow' indeed! Oh how it made me wince! How it cut me! I know better." That was of
                course a remark of your own when someone spoke of your "blameless life."</p>
            <p>I was pleased to note in your letter that you were then no worse as regards your
                health; &#38; we continue to hope to hear still better news of you.</p>
            <p>This morning I received &amp; thank you for the copy of the <hi rend="underline">Phila
                    Press</hi><pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02532.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with what you call the "fishy" report of your visit from Arnold.<ptr target="n6163"/> 
                I guess it is fishy<ptr target="loc.02532_n4"/> &#38; a very poor reflection of the actual occurrence. I
                enclose a copy of a par. in this week's <hi rend="underline">Literary World</hi><ptr target="loc.02532_n5"/>
                referring to it.</p>
            <p>I also send you a copy of the <hi rend="underline">Academy</hi><ptr target="loc.02532_n6"/> containing an extract
                from Arnolds "Seas and Lands"<ptr target="loc.02535_n5"/> in wh: he refers to his former visit to you.</p>
            <p>Your remarks about the autograph hunters amused me, as we<pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc.02532.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> have one in Bolton&#8212;his name
                is Collins<ptr target="n5001"/>&#8212;who has written to you twice &#38; cannot
                understand why you should write to me so often &#38; have never acknowledged <hi
                    rend="underline">his</hi> letters! "<hi rend="underline">Poor</hi> creetur!"</p>
            <p>This has been a miserably wet day here. Tonight I have had two good hours' work upon
                my paper (on you) wh. I am to read at the next meeting of the "Bolton Literary
                Society."<ptr target="loc.02532_n8"/></p>
            <p>It is now 11 oclock so I think I will go to bed &#38; finish this tomorrow.
            Good night &#38; God bless you!</p>

                <p>A moderately bright day with a good deal of haze &#38; a touch of frost in the
                    air. I have just returned from a long round of visits in my open carriage wh. I
                    have quite enjoyed&#8212;the air outside the town is really very bracing &#38;
                    exhilirating. I met a friend of of mine who said&#8212;"Have
                    you seen this week's <hi rend="underline">Penny Illustrated Paper</hi><ptr target="loc.02532_n7"/>?' "No" I
                    said "Why?" "Because there's a nice<pb xml:id="leaf005r"
                        facs="loc.02532.006_large.jpg" type="recto"/> little bit about your old
                    friend, Whitman in it!" he replied.</p>
                <p>I went at once to the Railway bookstall &#38; got some copies &#38; send one to
                    you, one to H.L.T<ptr target="n3041"/> one to Andrew Rome<ptr
                        target="loc.04931_n2"/> &#38; one to Dr. Bucke. It is a trifle but even as

                <p>I have had another short round of visits in the town, &#38; peeped in at the
                    annual Chrysanthemum show in the Town Hall. A really magnificent display of
                    bloom. Surely the very acme of perfection in floriculture.<pb xml:id="leaf005v"

                    building of the Lanc &#38; York Ry Good's yard opposite&#8212;(my surroundings
                    are very prosaic)</p>
                <p>It will interest you to know that during the contest for seats on the Bolton
                    School Board this week the socialist candidate had a <pb xml:id="leaf006v"
                        facs="loc.02532.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> quotation from you

                    his posters with your name at foot. Another trifle but significant!</p>
