            <p>I still keep quite well considering—have been down here the past week<ptr target="pml.00050_n2"/>—every thing much the same as of old with our friends the S[tafford]s—Mr and Mrs S, and all their sons and daughters—Harry is down at Atlantic City, telegraph operator at a RR station but is going to Camden, same position—</p>
            
            <p>A fine week down here for me—the finest sort of mellow sunny autumn weather—the old woods fine &amp; I in it for hours every day (sometimes I think it as good in its way as the Creek)—I go about nearly the same, my lameness no better (occasionally pretty bad, worse) but my feelings of comfort &amp; strength in general better than former years—often decidedly better—</p>
            
            <p><date when="1880-11-13"><hi rend="italic">13th Saturday</hi></date>—Still here—We drove over yesterday (Mrs S and I) to the old place at Timber Creek &amp; down by the pond—I thought it beautiful as ever along the creek and banks—</p>
            
            <p>This month <hi rend="italic">Scribner</hi> has a long criticism by E C Stedman on L of G &amp; author, quite funny—"I would &amp; I would not" style, with a bad portrait<ptr target="pml.00050_n3"/>—Dr. B[ucke] is furious—Burroughs thinks it well enough &amp; will do good—probably the truth between the two—</p>
            
            <p>I see in the papers allusions to "the Gilchrist Thomas process" &amp; its adoption in some of the great works &amp; foundries—So I think it must be a permanent triumph—I congratulate you all &amp; of course Percy especially (for all I dont know him)<ptr target="pml.00050_n4"/>—</p>

            <p>Rather cold, the feeling of snow, but dry &amp; pleasant in a way—I sell some of my books occasionally—have quite a supply left—of late have had more <hi rend="italic">American</hi> purchasers than foreigners—(different from previous experience)<ptr target="pml.00050_n5"/>—</p>
            
            <p>Rec'd your letter of two months since in Canada—it was very welcome—I wrote a postal card from here to Herbert, over a month ago<ptr target="pml.00050_n6"/>—Did he get it? Is the address on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> right? Do you see any thing of my friend Josiah Child?<ptr target="pml.00050_n7"/> A gentleman named Ingram<ptr target="pml.00050_n8"/> (in the Engineer's office, London General Post Office) has written to me twice in the interest of publishing a Vol: of my prose writings in London<ptr target="pml.00050_n9"/>—He seems to be a nice sort of man (is the author of an edition of Poe in London)—I think I shall give him your address &amp; ask to call on you.</p>
