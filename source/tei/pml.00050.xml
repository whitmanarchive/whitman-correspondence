            <p>I still keep quite well considering&#8212;have been down here the past week<ptr target="pml.00050_n2"/>&#8212;every thing much the same as of old with our friends the S[tafford]s&#8212;Mr and Mrs S, and all their sons and daughters&#8212;Harry is down at Atlantic City, telegraph operator at a RR station but is going to Camden, same position&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>A fine week down here for me&#8212;the finest sort of mellow sunny autumn weather&#8212;the old woods fine &#38; I in it for hours every day (sometimes I think it as good in its way as the Creek)&#8212;I go about nearly the same, my lameness no better (occasionally pretty bad, worse) but my feelings of comfort &#38; strength in general better than former years&#8212;often decidedly better&#8212;</p>
            
            <p><date when="1880-11-13"><hi rend="italic">13th Saturday</hi></date>&#8212;Still here&#8212;We drove over yesterday (Mrs S and I) to the old place at Timber Creek &#38; down by the pond&#8212;I thought it beautiful as ever along the creek and banks&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>This month <hi rend="italic">Scribner</hi> has a long criticism by E C Stedman on L of G &#38; author, quite funny&#8212;"I would &#38; I would not" style, with a bad portrait<ptr target="pml.00050_n3"/>&#8212;Dr. B[ucke] is furious&#8212;Burroughs thinks it well enough &#38; will do good&#8212;probably the truth between the two&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I see in the papers allusions to "the Gilchrist Thomas process" &#38; its adoption in some of the great works &#38; foundries&#8212;So I think it must be a permanent triumph&#8212;I congratulate you all &#38; of course Percy especially (for all I dont know him)<ptr target="pml.00050_n4"/>&#8212;</p>

            <p>Rather cold, the feeling of snow, but dry &#38; pleasant in a way&#8212;I sell some of my books occasionally&#8212;have quite a supply left&#8212;of late have had more <hi rend="italic">American</hi> purchasers than foreigners&#8212;(different from previous experience)<ptr target="pml.00050_n5"/>&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Rec'd your letter of two months since in Canada&#8212;it was very welcome&#8212;I wrote a postal card from here to Herbert, over a month ago<ptr target="pml.00050_n6"/>&#8212;Did he get it? Is the address on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> right? Do you see any thing of my friend Josiah Child?<ptr target="pml.00050_n7"/> A gentleman named Ingram<ptr target="pml.00050_n8"/> (in the Engineer's office, London General Post Office) has written to me twice in the interest of publishing a Vol: of my prose writings in London<ptr target="pml.00050_n9"/>&#8212;He seems to be a nice sort of man (is the author of an edition of Poe in London)&#8212;I think I shall give him your address &#38; ask to call on you.</p>
