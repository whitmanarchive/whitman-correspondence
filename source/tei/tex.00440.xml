                <salute>Dear Sirs</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours of 21st <choice>
                <orig>rec'd</orig><reg>received</reg></choice>, with the curious list—I suppose of course from the
                District Attorney's office—of "suggestions" lines and pages and pieces &amp;c.
                to be "expunged." The list whole &amp; several is rejected by me, &amp; will not be
                thought of under any circumstances.<ptr target="upa.00204_n1"/></p>
            <p>To give you a definitive idea of what I meant in my notes of March 8 and March
                19—&amp; of course stick to—I mail you with this a copy of L. of G. with
                the not numerous but fully effective changes and cancellations I thought of making:
                see in it pages
            <list><item>84</item>
            <item>88</item>
            <item>89</item>
            <item>&amp; 90</item></list></p>
            <p>All those lines &amp; passages marked in pencil to come out, &amp; their places to be
                exactly filled with other matter—so that they will superficially present the
                same appearance as now.<ptr target="upa.00204_n2"/> The whole thing would not
                involve an expense of more than from 5 to $10—</p>
            <p>My proposition is that we at once make the revision here indicated, &amp; go on with
                the regular issue of the book—If then any further move is made by the District
                Attorney &amp; his backers—as of course there are others behind it
                all—they will only burn their own fingers, &amp; very badly—</p>
            <p>I want the paper copy I send of L of G. returned to me when through.<ptr target="upa.00204_n3"/></p>

            <postscript>
               <p>Let this whole matter be kept quiet in the house—no talk or information
                    that may lead to newspaper items—the change to be just silently
                    made—the book, &amp; at casual view all its pages, to look just the
                    same—only those minutely looking detecting the difference—</p>
                <p>Inform the official people at once that the cancellation is to be made for future
                        editions.<ptr target="upa.00204_n4"/></p>
