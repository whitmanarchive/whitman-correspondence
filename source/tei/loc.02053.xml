            <p>How best can I introduce myself to you? How can I make myself known + liked by you
                who so well-known and loved by me.</p>

            <p>When we call on folks + wish to make a good impression we don our best clothes, make
                our best bow tell our politest lie + the thing's done.</p>
            <p>But to you, who likes naked flesh better than broadcloth, a warm grasp, a close
                embrace better than a fancy bow, the truth harsh and sonorous better than tinkling
                lies&#8212;to you I can't simper and smirk.</p>
            <p>I love you! I claim you for a friend! I hold you tight! sometimes you strangely elude
                me! A few times you speak unkindly, worse you speak sometimes in an unknown tongue
                but yet you comfort and cheer me!</p>
            <p>I read your "Specimen Days"<ptr target="n4121"/> first and liked them. I liked the
                chatty, shrewd kindhearted old friend who chaperoned me through the war + all over
                the States. And then I read the Leaves of Grass and met my dearest friend! Didn't
                and don't yet half understand it all except that it breathes + lives + like all
                things that live and breath it has much of mystery + miracle about it all through.
                (After its only dead things that are dissectable)</p>

            <p>Many things more I want to say but haven't words for now. Little things are the
                easiest to say always and of those I have but few for Walt Whitman. I will write
                again if my disjointed rhapsodies are bearable and I hope to come down and see you
                very shortly if your health permits you to see people.</p>
            <p>And now dear friend and teacher have I spoken at all into words that are clear? If so
                Walt Whitman knows his</p>
