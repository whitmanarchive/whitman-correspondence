               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I feel middling well to-day. I go to the office just the same as usual—If I had a good home where I could have a decent time, &amp; keep in for three or four days, I should get all right—the principal trouble with me, I think, is neuralgia—it gives me great distress in the head at times—but the spells do not last long at a time—I eat pretty nearly the same as usual—but do not sleep well—But I think I am making too much of it—I thought I would write you just a few lines, you would get Saturday.</p>
            <p>You must tell Jeff or George to get the "Galaxy" of Dec. 1.—it is a magazine—it is for sale at most of the book-stands—30 cts—it has a piece in about me<ptr target="nyp.00213_n1"/>—I think it is very good—John Burroughs is a young man from Delaware county, New York—he lives here, now, is married—I am well acquainted with him, &amp; he &amp; his wife have been very hospitable &amp; friendly to me.</p>
            <p>Mr. Conway's article<ptr target="nyp.00213_n2"/> was about as impudent as it was friendly—quite a mixture of good &amp; bad.</p>
            <p>I am glad you like Emily Price—she is a good girl. She seems to me one that you needn't make any fuss or change—but let domestic things go on just as they may be, when she comes to visit you.</p>
            <p>It is pleasant this afternoon—the sun is shining out—the river &amp; hills on the other side look beautiful.</p>
            <p>I sent Han a book—"Lady Audley's Secret"<ptr target="nyp.00213_n3"/>—&amp; shall send her a letter to-day.</p>
            <p>Dont forget, George or Jeffy, to get the Galaxy of Dec. 1.</p>
            <p>Mother, if any of you want another copy of the new "Leaves of Grass," I can send you an order for one on the binder in New York, &amp; you can get it.</p>
            <p>Well, mother dear, I believe that is all—except that I am getting a new pair of trowserloons—Shall not get any other new clothes this winter—</p>
            <p>Love to George &amp; all.</p>
