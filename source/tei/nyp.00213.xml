            <p>I feel middling well to-day. I go to the office just the same as usual&#8212;If I had a good home where I could have a decent time, &amp; keep in for three or four days, I should get all right&#8212;the principal trouble with me, I think, is neuralgia&#8212;it gives me great distress in the head at times&#8212;but the spells do not last long at a time&#8212;I eat pretty nearly the same as usual&#8212;but do not sleep well&#8212;But I think I am making too much of it&#8212;I thought I would write you just a few lines, you would get Saturday.</p>
            <p>You must tell Jeff or George to get the "Galaxy" of Dec. 1.&#8212;it is a magazine&#8212;it is for sale at most of the book-stands&#8212;30 cts&#8212;it has a piece in about me<ptr target="nyp.00213_n1"/>&#8212;I think it is very good&#8212;John Burroughs is a young man from Delaware county, New York&#8212;he lives here, now, is married&#8212;I am well acquainted with him, &amp; he &amp; his wife have been very hospitable &amp; friendly to me.</p>
            <p>Mr. Conway's article<ptr target="nyp.00213_n2"/> was about as impudent as it was friendly&#8212;quite a mixture of good &amp; bad.</p>
            <p>I am glad you like Emily Price&#8212;she is a good girl. She seems to me one that you needn't make any fuss or change&#8212;but let domestic things go on just as they may be, when she comes to visit you.</p>
            <p>It is pleasant this afternoon&#8212;the sun is shining out&#8212;the river &amp; hills on the other side look beautiful.</p>
            <p>I sent Han a book&#8212;"Lady Audley's Secret"<ptr target="nyp.00213_n3"/>&#8212;&amp; shall send her a letter to-day.</p>
            <p>Dont forget, George or Jeffy, to get the Galaxy of Dec. 1.</p>
            <p>Mother, if any of you want another copy of the new "Leaves of Grass," I can send you an order for one on the binder in New York, &amp; you can get it.</p>
            <p>Well, mother dear, I believe that is all&#8212;except that I am getting a new pair of trowserloons&#8212;Shall not get any other new clothes this winter&#8212;</p>
            <p>Love to George &amp; all.</p>
