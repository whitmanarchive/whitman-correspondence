                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>We were very much pleased to receive your kind postcard of Feb 26<hi rend="underline"
                    >th</hi>,<ptr target="loc.04703_n2"/> addressed to Dr. Johnston,<ptr
                    target="n4102"/> &#38; only wish that you could have reported an improved
                condition of health, instead of "about same." We hope to receive better news
                later.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01122.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I can't write much now, but will send you a copy of a very kind &#38; friendly letter
                I have received from J.A. Symonds,<ptr target="n0615"/> which will no doubt interest
                you.</p>
            <p>Not the least interesting thing about it to me is the frank cordial spirit of
                comradeship &#38; kindness, ("real &#38; not fictitious") it reveals, &#38; which
                seems to distinguish those who are "sealed of the tribe of Walt."<ptr target="loc.04703_n5"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01123.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I had asked him not to trouble with replying to my letter, &#38; he sends me this
                long friendly letter in return!</p>
            <p>The "forgeries" he refers to are facsimile copies of a letter &#38; post cards
                received from you which I made &#38; sent him&#8212;along with copies Dr. J. had
                made of letters from Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38; Warry.<ptr
                    target="loc.07319_n6"/> (I afterwords sent him a copy of Dr. Bucke's<ptr
                    target="n0119"/> letter).</p> 
            <p>It has been my custom to make as careful copies as possible of your correspondence,
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01124.jpg" type="verso"/> &#38; to give Dr.
                J. copies of the postcards <hi rend="underline">I</hi> receive. I sent these (last
                received) to Symonds.</p>
            <p>The weather here is very fine but cold&#8212;frosty nights, &#38; clear, sunshiny
                days with north &#38; north-east winds.</p>
            <p>Have had a busy week &#38; cannot write at much length, but with best love to you
                always</p>

                        target="loc.04703_n3"/> It pains us to note that you are still "in a bad
                    way," though so cheerful &#38; kind. Your loving-kindness in writing to us so
                    frequently, while so unwell, affects us very deeply, &#38; rouses in us depths
                    of responding gratitude &#38; love &#38; sympathy beyond expression. If only we
                    could <hi rend="underline">do</hi> something to help you, what a relief it would
                    be to our impotent yearning!</p>

                <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston called on me this morning, &#38; told me he
                    intended to send you a copy of one of my letters. I don't think it worth it, but
                    I allowed him to do as he wished.</p>
                <p>It is addressed to the friend in Liverpool who procured my copy of the 1855
                    edition of L of G. He had looked into it, but could make nothing of it. In a
                    hurried note he told me his impressions (adverse ones) &#38; asked what I had to
                    say about them. <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01127.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    When I replied I was tired &#38; out of sorts. And I felt that it was labour
                    thrown away (in a sense) as he was quite unlikely to come under your influence.
                    He is many years older than I. But he is one of the most respected &#38; valued
                    of my friends, &#38; I owed him such return as I could make for many kindnesses;
                    so I wrote at some length. But the letter is too elementary &#38; inadequate to
                    be worth your perusal, &#38; was, of course, only meant to meet the special case
                        <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.01128.jpg" type="verso"/> of the man to
                    whom it was addressed.</p> 
                <p>I have known him many years, but chiefly at a distance &#38; through
                    correspondence.</p> 
                <p>Johnston received a letter yesterday morning from Capt. Nowell,<ptr
                    target="loc.04703_n4"/> in which he mentioned that he had told you of a copy of <hi
                        rend="underline">L. of G</hi>. he had seen offered for sale in L'pool for
                        &#163;<hi rend="underline">6.18.0</hi>. Probably it was the copy which
                        Goldstraw<ptr target="n5001"/> got for me &#64; <hi rend="underline">
                        &#163;6</hi>.&#8212;A piece of extravangance on my part, perhaps, but I
                    value it too highly to think so</p>
