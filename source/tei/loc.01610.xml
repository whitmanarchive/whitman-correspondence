            <p>You have had many tributes from the learned and great of Europe and America. Yet you
                will not despise that of a simple, honest woman who writes to thank you, in all
                sincerity for those "Leaves of Grass" from which her soul has drawn such health,
                freshness and aroma. I visited Washington for the first time, this May. The quest of
                Mrs. Schwartz<!--annotation?-->, (who one night in passing off the platform of a
                Car, gave you a rose) I was compelled to many Car rides in my transit to "the City".
                On Car No 14, I encountered you more than once. Your face, which I chose to think a
                    <hi rend="underline">facsimile</hi> of the grand old patriarch's, Abraham,
                attracted me. Through Mr. Devlin<!-- <ptr target="n0181"/> -->, from Mr.
                Doyle<!--annotation-->, I was allowed to read your&#8212;I prefer saying&#8212;I was
                permitted a <hi rend="underline">long look</hi> into that wonderful mirror of your
                creation, where I saw the reflex of <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01610.002.jpg" type="verso"/> soul, and felt the
                influence of your divining power. Mr <choice>
                    <sic>O'Conner's</sic>
                    <corr>O'Connor's</corr>
                </choice><!-- <ptr target="n0452"/> --> manly, eloquent, but most unnecessary vindication<!-- <ptr target="n0272"/> --> of your purity was also given me.</p>

            <p>I needed no one to translate for me the language of yours, written so plainly in
                every line and furrow of your face, and revealed to the world in the many gracious
                deeds of love to your kind.</p>

            <p>I closed your book revelation, a wiser and more thoughtful woman, than when, from
                idle curiosity I first opened it, at the very stanza, "Perfectious" which I have
                just quoted. Life held grander possibilities to me from that hour, and the mission
                of a soul, born into this world to love, influence, and suffer, was invested with
                profounder responsibilities.</p>

            <p>To whoever is granted the power to make <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01610.003.jpg" type="recto"/> another long<!-- song? - KM --> for <hi rend="underline">Truth</hi>, for its own beautiful sake; love the lowly and
                oppressed for the sake of the divinity spark which is in each human body, and see in
                Nature the heart of the great Mother–God who conceived and gave it
                birth.&#8212;To such an one there is a debt due of allegiance and profound
                gratitude.</p>
            <p>I thank you Sir, with all my heart, and pray for you the abiding Presence and hourly
                Comfort of the divine <hi rend="underline">Pure in Heart</hi> whom you worship.</p>

            <p>I need make no apology for this note. You will not misunderstand it. I go to my home
                in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, tomorrow. I may never again chance to see you, but you
                will believe, nevertheless that I will wish for you&#8212;and teach others to do the
                same&#8212;a long earth–life of usefulness, and an eternity of <hi rend="underline">appreciation</hi> and reward.</p>
