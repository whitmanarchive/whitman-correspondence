                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am <hi rend="underline">perfectly delighted</hi> with the photograph of thee
                which has just come, addressed in thy handwriting&#8212; &#38; with the date June 1 1887,
                written on it. How well I remember thee in that big comprehensive chair! </p>
                <p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="owu.00029.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> It has come as a
                sort of greeting to my little baby, who will be just two weeks old tomorrow. I held
                it up for her to look at, but I must truthfully confess that her attention seemed to
                be more absorbed with her own pink fingers that with the picture! I think <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="owu.00029.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Alys or father must
                have told thee of the baby's birth, I have been hardly able to write before, &#38;
                am still in bed&#8212;but I can't keep sending a note of thanks for thy photograph,
                &#38; giving thee at the same time a little news about the wee stranger. <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="owu.00029.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> She weighs the
                immense amount of nine pounds, &#38; spends her days chiefly in eating, sleeping
                &#38; being adored. She almost never cries, and she sleeps the whole night through.
                She is very fat and very pretty, with great blue eyes, &#38; a fascinating little
                dimple. Alas! I am afraid I cannot hide the self-evident fact that I am very proud
                of her, and think her the most wonderful baby that was ever born. It is no use
                struggling against Fate. I meant to be strictly impartial in my judgment of her, but
                "C'est plus for que moi". I think she is a little angel. As for myself&#8212;I hope
                to be up again in a week or so, and quite well and strong. The doctor and nurse say
                I am making a marvelous recovery&#8212;but I do not find it at all hard to imagine
                physical states of greater bliss than my own. However, the Angel more than makes up
                for it all.</p>
            <p>It is a lovely day&#8212;the river is shining in the sunlight &#38; the boys are
                leaping into the water from the barges &#38; splashing merrily about. Little
                Ray&#8212;the baby&#8212;lies cooing in her cot, &#38; if I interpret her soft
                sounds aright she is sending thee her thanks for making her mother so happy by thy
                gift.</p>

                thee.</p></postscript>
