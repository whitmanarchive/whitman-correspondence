            <p>I have waited till I am afraid you have forgotten me or else never received the
                letter I wrote in answer to yours of date "a long time ago" <add type="insertion">(<hi rend="underline">very definite</hi>)</add> in reply to my first to
                you: I am inclined to believe that your silence does not mean that you do not wish
                to hear from me again. You remember the "Dear Strange Boy and brother" as you were
                pleased to call me do you not?</p>
            <p>I have an impression that I can give a reason why you did not answer my last though I
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02857.002.jpg" type="verso"/> perhaps do you
                injustice in the thought. When I wrote I said something I think about
                Wentworth<!-- <ptr target="n0689"/> --> having the copyright of your book. Now it strikes me that
                you might have thought me interested in the matter but I am not nor have I ever
                been. You do not need that I should go into particulars to tell you the conclusion
                arrived at about the matter. If I did you injustice pardon me.</p>
            <p>The past six months has brought changes to me as it probably has to you and I have
                had some sad experiences though I thrive I am all the better for it. Besides the
                experience has taught me many things that I should probably have never otherwise
                learned. Some times the world seems very dark but is only brighter for it when the
                clouds have passed away. I think we never enjoy <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02857.003.jpg" type="recto"/>any thing till we have suffered the
                opposite. And, were there no&#8212;what we call sun there would be no happiness. But
                the world is beautiful, happy and full of Love, and the longer I live the more I
                realize it. Every sorrow and sadness gives way to joy when we contemplate the future
                that awaits the immortal soul. Be life ever so weary, live on then, brave hearted.
                Hope on, through the darkness, and smile through. Heaven waiteth for mortals when
                earth is departed. And eternity lives at the death bed of years.</p>
            <p>What do you think of the political condition of affairs or are you no politician I
                can perhaps believe that you are not interested in such matters.</p>
            <p>But I will not <hi rend="underline">write</hi> more now till I hear from you again.
