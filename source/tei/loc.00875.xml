         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00875_n100"/> have not seen your friend Babbitt since he left the Mason Hospital (about the time I wrote you before); but I have been there to inquire about him<ptr target="loc.00875_n2"/>.  Three days ago I called, and a soldier who had recently seen him reported him as gradually regaining his strength, though not his voice.  He is able to go out a little.  He is with, or near, some good friends of his, who are no doubt a comfort to him.</p>
            <p>What you write me of yourself and of your experiences, interests me and makes me almost envy you the privilege of being with our noble unfortunate soldiers.  You ought to write the epic of this war.  By the way, has anything been done with Drum Taps?  O'Connor<ptr target="loc.00875_n3"/> said he would communicate with Carleton<ptr target="loc.00875_n4"/> on the subject.  I have spoken with one publisher here about them; but he did not bite.</p>
            <p>An item of great domestic importance to us will perhaps interest you.  A boy was born to me yesterday&#8212;a lusty little chap, fat, well-formed, weight ten pounds.  Mother doing well thus far.  I have seen the new moon over my right shoulder to some purpose lately.</p>
            <p>A few days ago I wrote a letter about you to Secretary Chase<ptr target="loc.00875_n5"/>.  I hope you will yet hear from him.  He acknowledged at the time the receipt of the book you handed him; so I knew the package must have reached you.  I am heartily glad if the books have been put to any use.  How is your friend Brown who was to lose his foot?<ptr target="loc.00875_n6"/>
            </p>
            <p>Give my love to the O'Connors.</p>
            <p>Good bye.</p>
