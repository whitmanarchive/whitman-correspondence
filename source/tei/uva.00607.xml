            <p>    
                Every thing is going on right here, &amp; ab't as usual—I keep ab't the same, &amp; well enough considering—went out 
                yesterday afternoon, (Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> wheel'd me up of course in the chair<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/>) to Mr &amp; Mrs: Harned's<ptr target="n4146"/> 
                where we had a first–rate dinner (my 5 o'clock supper) of champagne &amp; oysters—the best &amp; plenty—come back just 
                after 8. Both Mr and Mrs H so hospitable &amp; generous &amp; good to me—Mrs Doughty and Maggy are well &amp; Mrs D does very 
                well—gives me plenty for my meals &amp; all right<ptr target="uva.00607_n3"/>—we've killed one of the roosters, (he 
                behaved very badly &amp; put on airs) and had a chicken pot pie &amp; I had some of the c[hicken] for my breakfast this morning—&amp; 
                some new coffee better than the old, (wh' was not good)—My appetite is good as ever—Warry is well &amp; jolly &amp; keeps 
                first rate &amp; good to me—go out towards evn'g as ever—last night it rained &amp; keeps it half–up to day, &amp; is cloudy 
                &amp; dark &amp; half warm—Warry has just been in to make up the bed, &amp;c:—
                </p>
            <p>
                The most important event is Harry's marrying,<ptr target="loc.07663_n4"/> which is to come off this evn'g, to be by Squire Tarr<ptr target="n5001"/> at his house—
            </p>
            <p>
                Harry was up with me yesterday noon to talk ab't it—I felt quite solemn ab't it (I think more of the boy, &amp; I believe he does 
                of me, than we knew)—He kissed me &amp; hung on to my neck—O if he only gets a good wife &amp; it all turns out lasting &amp; 
                good (Mary, I think more of Harry than you suppose)—at any rate one first–rate point, it may anchor him in a way that nothing else 
                might, &amp; give him a definite object &amp; aim to work up to—(&amp; perhaps he needs that)—I am sitting up in my big den, 
                in the old chair as I write, every thing comfortable—
            </p>
            <p>
                <date when="1890-09-15"><hi rend="italic">5 P M</hi></date>—Chicken pot pie &amp; rice pudding to–day—&amp; oysters &amp; champagne yesterday—so you see, 
                Mary, we are not starving—
            </p>
            <p>
                <date when="1890-09-06"><hi rend="italic">Tuesday forenoon Sept: 16</hi></date>—Harry and Becky were married last evn'g, &amp; they came around here afterward a 
                little while, at my special invitation—I have had my breakfast (Warry broiled a bit of meat for me, very nice)—the sun has 
                been under a cloud, but I see it is plainly coming out—Love to you f'm me &amp; all of us—I enclose $5, 2 for Mrs: M[apes],<ptr target="uva.00607_n5"/>
                2 for the dear mother &amp; 1 for dear boy Glen<ptr target="n5001"/> &amp; my best respects &amp; well wishes to all—
