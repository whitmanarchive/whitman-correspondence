            <p>    
                Every thing is going on right here, &#38; ab't as usual&#8212;I keep ab't the same, &#38; well enough considering&#8212;went out 
                yesterday afternoon, (Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> wheel'd me up of course in the chair<ptr target="loc.03012_n1"/>) to Mr &#38; Mrs: Harned's<ptr target="n4146"/> 
                where we had a first&#8211;rate dinner (my 5 o'clock supper) of champagne &#38; oysters&#8212;the best &#38; plenty&#8212;come back just 
                after 8. Both Mr and Mrs H so hospitable &#38; generous &#38; good to me&#8212;Mrs Doughty and Maggy are well &#38; Mrs D does very 
                well&#8212;gives me plenty for my meals &#38; all right<ptr target="uva.00607_n3"/>&#8212;we've killed one of the roosters, (he 
                behaved very badly &amp; put on airs) and had a chicken pot pie &#38; I had some of the c[hicken] for my breakfast this morning&#8212;&#38; 
                some new coffee better than the old, (wh' was not good)&#8212;My appetite is good as ever&#8212;Warry is well &#38; jolly &#38; keeps 
                first rate &#38; good to me&#8212;go out towards evn'g as ever&#8212;last night it rained &#38; keeps it half&#8211;up to day, &#38; is cloudy 
                &#38; dark &#38; half warm&#8212;Warry has just been in to make up the bed, &#38;c:&#8212;
                </p>
            <p>
                The most important event is Harry's marrying,<ptr target="loc.07663_n4"/> which is to come off this evn'g, to be by Squire Tarr<ptr target="n5001"/> at his house&#8212;
            </p>
            <p>
                Harry was up with me yesterday noon to talk ab't it&#8212;I felt quite solemn ab't it (I think more of the boy, &#38; I believe he does 
                of me, than we knew)&#8212;He kissed me &#38; hung on to my neck&#8212;O if he only gets a good wife &#38; it all turns out lasting &#38; 
                good (Mary, I think more of Harry than you suppose)&#8212;at any rate one first&#8211;rate point, it may anchor him in a way that nothing else 
                might, &#38; give him a definite object &#38; aim to work up to&#8212;(&#38; perhaps he needs that)&#8212;I am sitting up in my big den, 
                in the old chair as I write, every thing comfortable&#8212;

                little while, at my special invitation&#8212;I have had my breakfast (Warry broiled a bit of meat for me, very nice)&#8212;the sun has 
                been under a cloud, but I see it is plainly coming out&#8212;Love to you f'm me &#38; all of us&#8212;I enclose &#36;5, 2 for Mrs: M[apes],<ptr target="uva.00607_n5"/>
