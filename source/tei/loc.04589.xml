                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>I was profoundly touched, and greatly enriched and honored, by your unexpected gift.
                From every point of view, I don't see that anything of more worth could be added to
                the hoard of—1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the
                broad, the original, the imaginative, in poetry and humane literature, 4. Of one whose
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_gt.00094_large.jpg" type="verso"/>  
                good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student and reader.</p>
            <p>You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &amp; in this
                striking and unique shape, all your life-work<ptr target="n4195"/>. There is no book just like this,
                &amp; there never will be. The <hi rend="underline">personal</hi> note is
                everywhere. Moreover, as a <hi rend="underline">book</hi> merely, the most famous
                bibliophile—with the famous binders &amp; printers, &amp; a mine of wealth, to
                aid him—could not get up a volume so notable &amp; so sure of ever-growing
                value. This would be my notion of the volume, as
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_gt.00095_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                a <hi rend="underline">book</hi>, if I knew nothing of its author—of its "only
                begetter." Moreover, it impresses one as the result of a growth: of something not <hi rend="underline">made</hi>, off-hand, but the final outcome of a certain secular evolution.</p> 
            <p>For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my
                haven,—believe me, my dear &amp; honored old Bard, they are returned to you
                four-fold.</p>
            <p>I have delayed this letter a few days, because it was in my mind to send you a
                return-gage: a more dimensional, but
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_gt.00096_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                otherwise inadequate, symbol of our common nationalism &amp; outlook. To-day, then, I
                forward to you by express the first seven volumes of the "Library of American
                Literature"<ptr target="nyp.00668_n11"/> (the seventh 
                enriched by your own poetry and portrait)—which you
                will accept, I trust, &amp; which surely will seem of more significance to Walt
                Whitman than any other gift which <hi rend="underline">I</hi> could send him. The
                succeeding volumes will reach you as they come from the press.—If you live to
                read them all,—well, I needn't wish you any
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_gt.00097_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                greater length of years! To edit them, we have served as many years as Jacob served
                for Rachel, and I fear our practical returns will be as disappointing as he found
                the gift of Leah.</p>
            <p>However,—<hi rend="underline">you</hi> of all men will take in, comprehend, the
                purpose, the meaning, of this long compilation. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> will
                justly
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_gt.00098_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                estimate its significance, &amp; this quite irrespectively of its literary or
                artistic qualities. There are masterpieces in it. But it is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> a collection of masterpieces: it is something of more moment to you
                &amp; me. It is <hi rend="underline">America</hi>. It is the symbolic, the
                essential, America from her infancy to the second Century of her grand Republic. It
                is the diary, the year-book, the Century-book, of her progress from Colonialism to
                Nationality. All her health &amp;
                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_gt.00099_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                disease are here: her teething, measles, mumps, joy, delirium, nuptials, conflicts,
                dreams, delusions, her meanness &amp; her nobility. We purposely make the work <hi rend="underline">inclusive</hi>—trying to show every facet of this our
                huge, as yet half-cut, rose-diamond.</p>
            <p>So I know that, in turning these pages, from the early "adventure," from the early
                theology &amp; superstition, from the early heroism &amp; <hi rend="underline">grit</hi>, down to
                <pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc_gt.00100_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                the latest moment of our wondrous development,—I know that you will be
                seeing, in your chamber, what you have so observed &amp; thought upon for
                years—as you went to &amp; fro, among the people, through the land &amp; under
                the canopy. In short, I send you an American "cosmorama" for your own room: hoping
                it may lighten some of the hours of your retirement there, &amp; that it may now
                &amp; then remind you of its designer.</p>
            <p>Nothing better becomes this compilation than the portion covering selections from
                your
                <pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc_gt.00101_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                own work. Fine as it is, I said to Miss Hutchinson<ptr target="loc.04589_n2"/> that I could
                readily obtain half-a-dozen counterparts, equally imaginative and noble, from your
                "Leaves of Grass," etc.—It is my hope that you see, from the manner in which
                that <hi rend="underline">précis</hi> is made up, that I do measurably
                comprehend your genius &amp; philosophy; that I have <hi rend="underline">understood</hi> your purposes in life &amp; in art. A chap was here, 'tother
                day, who had been visiting you. He reported you
                <pb xml:id="leaf006v" facs="loc_gt.00102_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                as saying that I wouldn't take off my hat to Apollo, if we sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> 
                happen to meet. That pleased me immensely, &amp; I "laughed consumedly," as the old Comedies say. Well:
                there <hi rend="underline">is</hi> too much taking off of hats, but I certainly
                should doff my own to the Sun-God. On the other hand, if it should prove cold in his
                neighborhood, I should speedily clap it on again.—Nor have I ever essayed <hi rend="underline">serious &amp; prolonged criticism</hi> of any man, unless I
                deemed him worthy of it—i.e. <hi rend="underline">great</hi>. For the
                small-fry, a few passing words &amp; kindly phrases are quite enough. This is my
                longest letter of the year—rambling enough, but may you have plenty of time to
                read a thousand such! And so always think of me as one of your most faithful
                lovers—for such indeed is</p>
