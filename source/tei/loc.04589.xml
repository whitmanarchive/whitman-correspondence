                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was profoundly touched, and greatly enriched and honored, by your unexpected gift.
                From every point of view, I dont see that anything of more worth could be added to
                the hoard of&#8212;1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the
                broad, the original, the imaginative, in poetry and humane literature, 4. Of one
                whose</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_gt.00094_large.jpg" type="verso"/><hi
                    rend="underline">2</hi></p>
            <p>good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student
                and reader.</p>
            <p>You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &#38; in this
                striking and unique shape, all your life-work. There is no book just like this,
                &#38; there never will be. The <hi rend="underline">personal</hi> note is
                everywhere. Moreover, as a <hi rend="underline">book</hi> merely, the most famous
                bibliophile&#8212;with the famous binders &#38; printers, &#38; a mine of wealth, to
                aid him&#8212;could not get up a volume so notable &#38; so sure of ever-growing
                value. This would be my notion of the volume, as</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_gt.00095_large.jpg" type="recto"/><hi
                    rend="underline">3</hi></p>
            <p>a <hi rend="underline">book</hi>, if I knew nothing of its author&#8212;of its "only
                begetter." Moreover, it impresses one as the result of a growth: of something not <hi
                    rend="underline">made</hi>, off-hand, but the final outcome of a certain
                    <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aa" cert="high">secular</unclear>
                evolution.</p>
            <p>For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my
                haven,&#8212;believe me, my dear &#38; honored old Bard, they are returned to you
                four-fold.</p>
            <p>I have delayed this letter a few days, because it was in my mind to send you a
                return-gage: a more dimensional, but</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_gt.00096_large.jpg" type="verso"/><hi
                    rend="underline">4</hi></p>
            <p>otherwise inadequate, symbol of our common nationalism &#38; outlook. To-day, then, I
                forward to you by express the first seven volumes of the "Library of American
                Literature" (the seventh enriched by your own poetry and portrait)&#8212;which you
                will accept, I trust, &#38; which surely will seem of more significance to Walt
                Whitman than any other gift which <hi rend="underline">I</hi> could send him. The
                succeeding volumes will reach you as they came from the press.&#8212;If you live to
                read them all,&#8212;well, I needn't wish you any</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_gt.00097_large.jpg" type="recto"/><hi
                    rend="underline">5</hi></p>
            <p>greater length of years! To edit them, we have served as many years as Jacob served
                for Rachel, and I fear our practical returns will be as disappointing as he found
                the gift of Leah.</p>
            <p>However,&#8212;<hi rend="underline">you</hi> of all men will take in, comprehend, the
                purpose, the meaning, of this long compilation. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> will
                justly</p>

            <p>estimate its significance, &#38; this quite irrespectively of its literary or
                artistic qualities. There are masterpieces in it. But it is <hi rend="underline"
                    >not</hi> a collection of masterpieces: it is something of more moment to you
                &#38; me. It is <hi rend="underline">America</hi>. It is the symbolic, the
                essential, America from her infancy to the second Century of her grand Republic. It
                is the diary, the year-book, the Century-book, of her progress from Colonialism to
                Nationality. All her health &#38;</p>

            <p>disease are here: her teething, measles, mumps, joy, delirium, nuptials, conflicts,
                dreams, delusions, her meanness &#38; her nobility. We purposely make the work <hi
                    rend="underline">inclusive</hi>&#8212;trying to show every facet of this our
                huge, as yet half-cut, rose-diamond.</p>
            <p>So I know that, in turning these pages, from the early "adventure", from the early
                theology &#38; superstition, from the early heroism &#38; <hi rend="underline"
                    >grit</hi>, down to</p>

            <p>the latest moment of our wondrous development,&#8212;I know that you will be
                seeing, in your chamber, what you have so observed &#38; thought upon for
                years&#8212;as you went to &#38; fro, among the people, through the land &#38; under
                the canopy. In short, I send you an American "cosmorama" for your own room: hoping
                it may lighten some of the hours of your retirement there, &#38; that it may now
                &#38; then remind you of its designer.</p>
            <p>Nothing better becomes this compilation than the portion covering selections from
                your</p>

            <p>own work. Fine as it is, I said to Miss Hutchinson<ptr target="n5000"/> that I could
                readily obtain half-a-dozen counterparts, equally imaginative and noble, from your
                "Leaves of Grass," etc.&#8212;It is my hope that you see, from the manner in which
                that <hi rend="underline">pr&#233;cis</hi> is made up, that I do measurably
                comprehend your genius &#38; philosophy; that I have <hi rend="underline"
                    >understood</hi> your purposes in life &#38; in art. A chap was here, 'tother
                day, who had been visiting you. He reported you</p>
            <p><pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc_gt.00102_large.jpg" type="verso"/><hi

            <p>as saying that I wouldn't take off my hat to Apollo, if we sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> 
                happen to meet. That
                pleased me immensely, &#38; I "laughed consumedly", as the old Comedies say. Well:
                there <hi rend="underline">is</hi> too much taking off of hats, but I certainly
                should doff my own to the Sun-God. On the other hand, if it should prove cold in his
                neighborhood, I should speedily clap it on again.&#8212;Nor have I ever essayed <hi
                    rend="underline">serious &#38; prolonged criticism</hi> of any man, unless I
                deemed him worthy of it&#8212;i.e. <hi rend="underline">great</hi>. For the
                small-fry, a few passing words &#38; kindly phrases are quite enough. This is my
                longest letter of the year&#8212;rambling enough, but may you have plenty of time to
                read a thousand such! And so always think of me as one of your most faithful
                lovers&#8212;for such indeed is</p>
