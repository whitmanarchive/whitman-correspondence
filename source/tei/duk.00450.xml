            <p>Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> and Jessie<ptr target="n1055"/> came here yesterday&#8212;I

                alleviating all that stale, dusty, musty atmosphere&#8212;drew out a carpet kept in
                reserve, and we put it down&#8212;Lou engineering&#8212;to a line&#8212;then she
                went away and returned having purchased a new carpet for Han's<ptr target="n0285"/>
                sleeping room, and had a stove for winters use set up&#8212;bought an arm chair, a

                was put in place in our best room&#8212;a good heater. The women worked, and so did

                none left.</p> 
            <p>I wished that she had left 25 dollars for the taxes&#8212;but alas&#8212;numerous
