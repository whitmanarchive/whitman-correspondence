                Another day of midsummer warmth &amp; beauty&#8212;Never in my life do I remember to have known such weather so long 
                continued. Every day perfect &amp; like its predecessors. I seem to be living an enchanted life in a new earth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And I rejoice on <hi rend="underline">your</hi> account. Surely you must be

                gaining health from it, consciously or not.

                I spent good part of this morning in writing letters home. My friends, of course, are interested in all my doings here, &amp; 
                I shall have to report pretty fully on my return. Perhaps my main hope, in connection with my trip, is that I may be able to
                make a better return for all their affection when I go back. I have reason to be devoutly thankful for my friends, &amp; it
                is a sacred privilege to me to convey their love to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>&#8212;the "poet of comrades" &amp; our own 
                dearest friend. If only I may acquire more of your spirit!

                This afternoon I read Symonds' poem "Love &amp; Death," &amp; copied most of it for further absorption at leisure. It seems so 
                characteristic of his cultured, sweet &amp; delicate spirit. God be with him &amp; bless him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tomorrow I shall be away, so shall not be able to write to you. I go to Forest (near Sarnia) for the day to visit 
                Dr. J's<ptr target="n4102"/> aunt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr.<ptr target="n0119"/> has some visitors tonight, so I write this (&amp; me to H.T.<ptr target="n4267"/>) in my 
                room&#8212;<hi rend="underline">your</hi> room. Through the open window I see a few stars out&#8212;Jupitor lustrious &amp;
                dominating&#8212;chorus of frogs to sounding.&#8212;

            <p>
                I sometimes wish my friends could see you personally &amp; come into direct contact with you. How their hearts would go out to you! 
                And I am sure you would love <hi rend="underline">them</hi>&#8212;plain, unaffected, manly fellows that they are.&#8212;I am a poor
                representative of them in anything but love to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I think it a blessed Providence that led the Dr. to shew me the letters he has that you wrote to Pete Doyle. How our friends will 
               respond to the warm affection &amp; kindness they manifest! Deeper &amp; warmer love to you than ever in their name!  
            </p>
