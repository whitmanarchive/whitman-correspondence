<p>the book is out &amp; 1st edition quite exhausted<ptr target="nyp.00446_n1"/>—</p>
            <p>I send you same mail with this a paper-bound copy of "Specimen Days" for your
                printing office use—will send you a regularly bound copy in a day or
                two—the volume is issued in precisely the same style as "Leaves of
                Grass"—same cloth binding, same butterfly on the back, same size,
                &amp;c.—It is a great jumble (as a man himself is)—Is an autobiography
                after its sort—(sort o' synonyms &amp; yet altogether
                different—"Montaigne," Rousseau's "Confessions" &amp;c)—is the gathering
                up, &amp; formulation, &amp; putting in identity of the wayward itemizings,
                memoranda, and personal notes of fifty years, under modern &amp; American
                conditions, a good deal helter-skelter but I am sure a certain sort of orbic
                compaction and oneness the final result—dwells long in its own peculiar way on
                the Secession War—gives glimpses of that event's strange interiors, especially
                the Army Hospitals—in fact makes the resuscitating and putting on record the
                    <hi rend="italic">emotional aspect</hi> of the war of 1861–'65 one of its
                principal features.</p>

            <p>The years from 1876 to the present date Whitman has been a partial paralytic. Very
                much of his days—(and nights also as it appears)—he has spent in the
                open air down in the country in the woods and fields, and by a secluded little New
                Jersey river—His memoranda on the spot of these days and nights fill a goodly
                portion of the Volume—Then comes the "Collect," embodying "Democratic Vistas,"
                the Preface to <choice>
                    <abbr>L of G.</abbr>
                    <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                </choice> of 1855, and much other prose.</p>

            <p>It is understood that Whitman himself considers "Specimen Days" the exponent and
                finish of his poetic work "Leaves of Grass," that each of the two volumes is
                indispensable in his view to the other, and that both together finally begin and
                illustrate his literary schemes in the New World. Talking lately in a half jocular
                vein to a friend he termed them his Adam and Eve, sent out in "this garden the
                world."</p>

            <p>(don't fail to copy this—can't it conclude your notice?)<ptr target="nyp.00446_n2"/></p>
