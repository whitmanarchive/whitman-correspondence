                <salute>My noble and dear friend&#8212;Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have had the pleasure of talking for you, and of you again. Yes&#8212;and a deep interest was aroused. It was good to hear 
                the listener say&#8212;"I promise you&#8212;I will read him now." One man&#8212;fine&#8212;true and scholarly and sincere took my 
                hand and said: "I am converted."</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00360_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Bless you&#8212;dear soul! Is it not good to have Truth for a theme?</p>
            <p>How I want to see you and talk with you. That few minutes&#8212;was so much to me&#8212;yet it was so short. 
                For years I have longed to sit beside you and have wondered how it would be. Then&#8212;when it came&#8212;it was so different 
                from my fancies&#8212;but <hi rend="underline">you</hi> dear friend, were not disappointing.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00361_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>Can you make a few strokes of your pen for me&#8212;just as a proof that the hand is no weaker than when I took it?</p>
            <p>I don't know just what to send that shall give you comfort or pleasure. Flowers fade soon. 
                Please have something that you want&#8212;and play that I sent it, instead of this unbeautiful Money Order.</p>
