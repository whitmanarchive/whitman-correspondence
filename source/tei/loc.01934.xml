            <p>It is very mortifying to me not to be in a position to send you even a small portion
                of the balance <choice>
                    <sic>your</sic>
                    <corr>you're</corr>
                </choice> due. We are in a much better locality for retail trade, and we hope to
                stir up a better mail trade by a new list which we shall send out soon. But we
                cannot hope for anything very satisfactory, considering the unprecedented stagnation
                in all business circles, for several weeks. Assuming A.K.B. &amp; Co.'s liabilities
                at such a time as this has made it very awkward for me. I never was in debt before.
                The business would be unmixed pleasure to me were my capital larger, as I think I
                can serve humanity better by distributing good books than in any other way. The
                first <choice>

                    <corr>opportunity</corr>
                </choice> that can be made, something will be sent you. I regret the inability to
                promptly settle more as I have understood you have never been paid by others who
                kept your books for sale. There seems no reason to doubt a good business being done
                here in a few weeks&#8212;in the early fall. I hope your health is improving. Many
                persons ask us about you, and take a keen interest in your welfare. I regret that I
                am not so situated as to be able to extend you an invitation to visit <name>New York</name>, and offer you comfortable quarters here while you
                remain; but I do not "keep house," have no family; and I vibrate between <name>New York</name> and <name>Brooklyn</name> as to
                sleeping quarters, not having any fixed habitation. Some one is compiling a book for
                the use of "Liberals" at funerals, etc. I have called his attention to your poem on
                Death ("Dark mother," etc.)<!-- <ptr target="n0694"/> -->, which I consider the finest ever written.</p>
