                     in the left column. An image of the entire leaf is unavailable, but images of each column are provided, in reading order. On the back, Whitman wrote a letter to Susan Stafford on April 12, 1887.

            <p>As you see by my address I am staying with a great friend of yours. You may see him
                this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,&#8212;going out as a
                schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet
                earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth,
                whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a
                clergyman, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00566_large.jpg" type="recto"/><!-- This is not actually a separate leaf; it is the other half of the first recto surface, 
                but since we do not have an image of the entire surface, both parts of the recto had to be split up into separate images. In order for the file to validate, 
                this has been marked up as a separate leaf.--> and
                this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently &#38; unobserved by the rest of his orthodox
                family.</p>
            <p>I posted a copy of my book<ptr target="loc.05995_n1"/> to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and
                tell me how you <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#smb">like it</unclear>.</p>
            <p>Andrew Lang<ptr target="n3116"/> wrote a leader in the Daily News about it and fine
                things have been said in the London, and <hi rend="underline">Scotch Press</hi>
                particularly. As yet, I have not taken
                my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time
                near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly
                within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &#38;</p>
