                yours of 26&#8212;a little wild &#38; nervous &#38; uncertain some parts, (but I am
                always glad to get any letters from you dear boy)&#8212;Harry, you certainly know
                well enough you have my best honorable loving friendship settled&#8212;Of the past I
                think only of the comforting soothing things of it all&#8212;I go back to the times
                at Timber Creek beginning most five years ago, &#38; the banks &#38; spring, &#38;
                my hobbling down the old lane&#8212;&#38; how I took a good turn there &#38;
                commenced to get slowly but surely better, healthier, stronger&#8212;Dear Hank I
                realize plainly that <hi rend="underline">if I had not known you</hi>&#8212;if it
                hadn't been for you &#38; our friendship &#38; my going down there summers to the
                creek with you&#8212;and living there with your folks, &#38; the kindness of your
                mother, &#38; cheering me up&#8212;I believe <hi rend="underline">I should not be a
                    living man to-day</hi>&#8212;I think &#38; remember deeply these things &#38;
                they comfort me&#8212;<hi rend="underline">&#38; you my darling boy are the central
                    figure of them all</hi>&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;Of the occasional ridiculous little storms &#38; squalls of the past I have quite
                discarded them from my memory<ptr target="loc.03997_n2"/>&#8212;&#38; I hope you
                will too&#8212;the other recollections overtop them altogether, &#38; occupy the
                only permanent place in my

                be discouraged by any business or other
                disappointments of the past&#8212;It will all turn out right&#8212;The main thing,
                in my opinion, after finding out as much as possible of life, &#38; entering upon it
                (it is a strange mixed business this life) is to live a good square one&#8212;This I
                believe you are really anxious to do, &#38; God bless you in it, &#38; you shall
                have all the help I can give&#8212;Your loving ever-faithful old friend &#38;
