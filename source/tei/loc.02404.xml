            <p>I'll not <hi rend="underline">date</hi> this, as I am away from home&#8212;farther than I've been for some time&#8212;at <hi rend="underline">town</hi>, 13 miles away. You might <unclear reason="damage" cert="low" resp="#nhg">thus</unclear> direct a reply.</p>
            
            <p>Well I <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> sold my cotton bales. The market <gap reason="damage" extent="7" quantity="8" unit="chars"/>. Compelled to sell to get money <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> tax. Had to agree to take one third <gap reason="damage" extent="damage" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> <unclear reason="damage" cert="high" resp="#vm">merchandise</unclear>. Think I've done well enough. At any rate what promises to <hi rend="underline">satisfy</hi> one ought to be <hi rend="underline">well</hi>. &amp; make the smallest <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="5" unit="chars"/> <hi rend="underline">a draw</hi> and <hi rend="underline">wait</hi>.</p>
            
            <p>I believe I will enclose you one dollar (without registering) for <hi rend="underline">past</hi> pay for J. Burroughs's<ptr target="n0129"/> book. You can let me know how much more will be required to get you <unclear reason="damage" cert="medium" resp="#nhg">another</unclear> copy. I think you will <gap reason="damage" extent="2" quantity="6" unit="chars"/> to keep the book I have. Then I can <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="5" unit="chars"/> it to my friends&#8212;and one's self likes to read a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> book over many times&#8212;that is if one's self has fine good sense.</p>
            
            <p>How I read the latter half of J.B's book quick and carefully at first&#8212;<hi rend="underline">then</hi> wanted <hi rend="underline">time</hi> to study the less important first half. I have loved The Birds,<ptr target="n0867"/> but <hi rend="underline">one needs names</hi> to study anything, and I always distrusted getting right names from our composite, mongrel population, and also
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02404.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            my eyes have been not strong enough for the purposes of Birds&#8212;<gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="5" unit="chars"/> them <hi rend="underline">sore</hi> by <hi rend="underline">reading</hi> in early life&#8212;now at 45 &amp; 46 they are better than <unclear reason="damage" cert="high" resp="#vm">from</unclear> 10 to 25 and I read the finest print, new <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> glasses. But I'll not <hi rend="underline">make discovery</hi> <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="5" unit="chars"/> and report to J.B&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>"Before Genius" <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="7" unit="chars"/> "Before Beauty" are good <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="5" unit="chars"/>. <hi rend="underline">Most</hi> <gap reason="damage" extent="2 words" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> are "just as surely coarse as they are fine." Probably General Lee was not <hi rend="underline">coarse</hi>, but was he great?</p>
            
            <p>That John Burroughs is one of the most highly accomplished men in the world, I dont doubt but claim it for him, and <hi rend="underline">morally</hi> his <hi rend="underline">likes and dislikes</hi> promise or argue <gap reason="damage" extent="1 word" quantity="4" unit="chars"/>. (I sent him a long letter in October already prepared and sent off a <hi rend="underline">few minutes</hi> after getting his book. If you can remember, next time you write to him say for me I did not get his reply. He may think I should have written again.</p>
            
            <p>This thing now while writing. Perhaps you would rather have to think a friend to be <hi rend="underline">vain</hi> than to think him <hi rend="underline">stupid</hi>. This might be the last time I can ever write to you&#8212;life is
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02404.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                uncertain. When I saw that your new book was going to be called Two Rivulets I suspected it might be <hi rend="underline">you and I</hi>&#8212;two "envisioned" and friendly souls. You must forgive me (even if you have to <hi rend="underline">laugh</hi> enough to complete the restoration of your health)&#8212;but I have really called Two Rivulets <hi rend="underline">our</hi> book. Then if you are rested enough to bear to laugh some more, I will say this&#8212;somebody <gap reason="damage" extent="1 or 2 words" quantity="8" unit="chars"/> had a curious story published in Blackwood's Magazine<ptr target="n0869"/>&#8212;it was copied by an American newspaper which accidentally fell into my hands&#8212;I was prepared for it in <unclear reason="damage" cert="medium" resp="#vm">part</unclear>. It was copied in October 1876. If you could see the volume of Blackwoods <unclear reason="damage" cert="medium" resp="#vm">for</unclear> 1876, maybe you will find it, and <unclear reason="damage" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">need</unclear> to be prepared to be <hi rend="underline">indignant</hi> for I think you were <hi rend="underline">abused one more time</hi>. Maybe you know who wrote the story entitled "John's Hero"&#8212;</p>
           
            <p>If I am "a seer" or in any way "great", certainly I am coarse as well as fine. Overflowing with lubricating <hi rend="underline">humor</hi>.</p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02404.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Now if this all looks like a lot of foolishness and stupidity, you are a man of great charity and you can</p>
            
            <p rend="center">and you must</p>
            
            <p>forgive me.</p>
            
            <p>I see what Burroughs says about Emerson's writings, and think I must order some of his books. A friend sent me a copy of the Boston "Index". Emerson's Prose Writings in Two Volumes is priced &#36;5, but whether &#36;5 each or &#36;2.50 each I cant tell but guess &#36;2.50 each. The small volumes <unclear reason="damage" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">separately</unclear> would cost much more but would be more handy and probably <hi rend="underline">larger print</hi>.</p>
            
            <p>I guess the collected  Prose works in two volumes may not contain <hi rend="underline">his last</hi> prose writing. Probably his First Essays and English Traits would be best for me if I should choose to invest in a small way at first.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe I need not write more now,</p>
