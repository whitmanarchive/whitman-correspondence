            <p>It is not for want of thinking of you, dear Walt, that I write but seldom: for
                indeed my thoughts are chiefly occupied with you &amp; your other self&#8212;your
                Poems&#8212;&amp; with struggles to say a few words that I think want saying about
                them; that might help some to their birthright who now stand off, either
                ignorant or misapprehending.</p>

            <p>We all go on much as usual.</p>

                    </choice> 13.</hi> I wonder if you will like a true story of Lady Dilke that I
                heard the other day&#8212;I do: It was before her marriage. She was a handsome
                young heiress, a daring horsewoman, fond of hunting. There was a man, weakly &amp;
                of good position, who had behaved very basely &amp; cruelly to a young girl in her
                neighborhood, &amp; when (as is the case in England) half the country was assembled
                on the hunting field, Lady D. faced him &amp; said in a voice that could be heard
                afar, "Sir you are a black-guard, &amp; if these gentlemen had the right
                spirit in them they would horsewhip you." He looked at her with effrontery &amp;
                made a mocking bow. "But," she continued, "since they won't, I will"&#8212;and she
                cut him across the face with her riding whip; upon which he turned and rode off
                the field, like a dog with his tail between his legs, &amp; reappeared in that
                neighbourhood no more. She was a woman much beloved&#8212;died at the birth of her
                first child (from too much chloroform having been given her). Her husband was
                heart-broken. I see you, too, are having floods. With us it pours five days
                out of seven, &amp; so in Germany &amp; France. We have made the acquaintance of
                Arabella Buckley, who has just written an interesting article about Darwin, whom she
                knew well, for the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>. She says his was the most
                entirely beautiful &amp; perfect nature she ever came in contact with. How I wish we
                could have a glimpse of each other, dear Friend&#8212;half an hour talk&#8212;nay, a
                good long look &amp; a hand-shake. Herby is overhead painting in his
                studio&#8212;such a pleasant room. How is John Burroughs? We owe him a letter &amp;
                thanks for a good <choice><abbr>art.</abbr><expan>article</expan></choice> on Carlyle. Love to you, dearest friend.</p>
