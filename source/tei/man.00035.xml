            <p>You see I venture to salute you,<ptr target="n0905"/> &amp; to write to you in the same strain as that in
                which you so kindly addressed me in your letter of 26 May, &amp; which I was <choice>
                    <abbr>vy</abbr>
                    <expan>very</expan>
                </choice> glad to receive. I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> get your Riddle Song,<ptr target="man.00035_n1"/>
                &amp; was very pleased indeed to have it, &amp; now I have your tribute to Emerson,
                which is exceedingly interesting. It is pleasant to see you all rallying round the
                grand old man of letters, but more than of letters.</p>

            <p>Alfred Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> left England <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="man_ej.00199_large.jpg" type="verso"/>about a week ago, for Venice, &amp;
                he will probably be absent for a month or more. but he shall have the paper on
                Emerson, &amp; anything else you forward me, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"
                    resp="#nhg">directly</unclear> he returns.</p>

            <p>Tennyson has two country houses, &amp; some people might say "therefore <hi
                    rend="underline">no home</hi>"! One is "Farringford, Freshwater, Isle of Wight,"
                where he abides for about seven months in the year, the winter especially&#8212;&amp; the
                other is "Aldworth, Haslemere, Surrey", where he spends nearly four <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="man_ej.00200_large.jpg" type="recto"/>months of the
                summer, &amp; he is usually a month or five weeks in London, in the Early Spring.</p>
            <p>I think you must send me anything you would like him to have, &amp; I will make it
                a duty, as well as a pleasure, to send it on to him at once.</p>
            <p>His son, &amp; my son-in-law, Lionel Tennyson, lives in London for some ten months
                out of the twelve, at 4 Sussex Place, Regents Park, N.W.</p>
            <p>I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> know Mrs. Gilchrist.<ptr target="n0259"/> She is re-editing the Life of
                Blake,<ptr target="loc.04050_n1"/> &amp; I have a few of his letters, &amp; she has <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="man_ej.00080_large.jpg" type="verso"/>been once or twice in my house to
                copy them for her book. I am not surprised that you are attached to her. She seemed
                to me most interesting and intelligent&#8212;&amp; it is a great thing to be <hi rend="underline"
                    >intelligent</hi>, is not it?</p>
            <p>I am much interested to hear how you live &amp; feel, taking life cheerfully. I wish we could clasp
                hands and talk of many matters. Spiritual as well as temporal. but there is a
                great callous
                Atlantic betwixt us. but I daresay you would hardly allow that the Atlantic was
                callous!</p>
