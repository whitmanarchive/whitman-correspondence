                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The good ship 'Crystal' landed me safe at Leith a fortnight &amp; more ago, after a
                voyage of 14½ days, which I relished greatly. I was the only passenger on
                board, &amp; so there was nothing to spoil the native sea-sentiment. For reading I
                had Hugo's<ptr target="n4276"/> "Les Miserables" &amp; Chapman's Homer, &amp; I read
                all the sea-poems in <hi rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi> with a fresh zest.
                After so many months in your new world, you can imagine how Edinburgh (Leith is the
                port of Edinburgh) affected me with its fine antiquity, its Walter-Scott-like<ptr target="n4277"/> atmosphere of old Scotch city life, &amp; all the rest of
                it. From the Castle, which overlooks the whole place, I had an inspiring vision of
                the past on my first afternoon.</p>
            <p>By this time I have fallen into the old routine again more or less. One day passes
                very much like another, &amp; unluckily the weather has <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03330.002.jpg" type="verso"/> been of the proverbial British
                kind,—wet, cold &amp; austere, six days out of seven. Within easy reach of
                this house is a great stretch of grassy land,—called the Town Moor, whence one
                gets a superb sweep of sky, &amp; there I often go &amp; ramble about, sometimes
                with a book for company. I shall very probably be here for another fortnight, &amp;
                then go to London for a week or two before going on to Wales where I may spend the  
                autumn.</p>
            <p>I was troubled to hear on reaching this side that you had been more than usually
                unwell, but Walter Scott's<ptr target="n4147"/> people tell me that they have had better news, which
                relieves my mind again.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="underline">Democratic Vistas</hi> vol.<ptr target="loc.03330_n1"/> is getting many first rate
                reviews. I will send some of these on presently. Meanwhile how goes the new book?
                Let me know if I can be of use in circulating it over here. Remember me to
                    Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/> Also to Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp;
                other friends</p>
