                <hi rend="underline">Daily Courier</hi> is of especial interest as containing an
                admirable critique of Dr Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> book &#38; I fear in sending it to me you have
                despoiled yourself of one of your treasures but
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02440.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            this will all the more enhance its value to me and I desire to thank you very
                cordially for it &#38; for the other papers you so kindly sent.</p>
            <p>Mr Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> has kindly shewn me the post card he received from you on Sept 12<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02440_n4"/> from

                it has by this time passed off &#38; left no bad effects upon you. We hope to hear

            you soon.</p>

            <p>We have had a glorious day for our out-of-door meeting&#8212;an ideally perfect day.
                Nearly all "the boys"<ptr target="loc.02440_n6"/> were present with two friends &#38; the reading of my notes
                &#38;c which took place in a green field beneath a tree, occupied nearly two hours
                &#38; was much enjoyed by every one &#38; by none more than myself for I seemed to
                be living over again the happy time I spent with you Much were they all
                interested in all I had to say &#38; much do they appreciate
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02440.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            all your kindness to me &#38; thro me to them. They esteem it a high honour to have
                been medially brought into personal contact with you &#38; Mr Wallace has been
                commissioned to express this to you by letter which he will do probably by next
                mail</p>
            <p>Pardon my writing more at present as it is close on mail time</p>
