            <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge the receipt of the "Camden Daily Courier" for June
                2nd 1883<ptr target="loc.02440_n1"/>[,] "Unity" Aug 28th 1890<ptr target="loc.02440_n2"/> &#38; the accompanying slips "of that blithe throat
                of thine" "Yonnondio" "Halcyon Days" &#38; "the voice of the rain".<ptr target="loc.02440_n3"/></p>

            <p>The <hi rend="underline">Daily Courier</hi> is of especial interest as containing an
                admirable critique of Dr Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/> book &#38; I fear in sending it to me you have
                despoiled yourself of one of your treasures but</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02440.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>this will all the more enhance its value to me and I desire to thank you very
                cordially for it &#38; for the other papers you so kindly sent.</p>

            <p>Mr Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> has kindly shewn me the post card he received from you on Sept 12th<ptr target="loc.02440_n4"/> from
                which I am extremely sorry to learn that you are suffering from an attack of the <hi

                confined to the house we are in hopes that it is not a very severe one &#38; that
                it has by this time passed off &#38; left no bad effects upon you. We hope to hear
                better news from</p>

            <p>you soon.</p>

            <p>We have seen the French article in the <hi rend="underline">Universal</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">Review</hi><ptr target="loc.02440_n5"/>&#8212;in fact I have the number containing it.</p>

            <p>Later 8pm</p>

            <p>We have had a glorious day for our out-of-door meeting&#8212;an ideally perfect day.
                Nearly all "the boys" were present with two friends &#83; the reading of my notes
                &#38;c which took place in a green field beneath a tree occupied nearly two hours
                &#38; was much enjoyed by every one &#38; by none more than myself for I seemed to
                be living over again the happy time I spent with you[.] Much were they all
                interested in all I had to say &#38; much do they appreciate</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02440.004.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>all your kindness to me &#38; thro me to them. They esteem it a high honour to have
                been medially brought into personal contact with you &#38; Mr Wallace has been
                commissioned to express this to you by letter which he will do probably by next
                mail</p>

            <p>Pardon my writing more at present as it is close on mail time</p>
