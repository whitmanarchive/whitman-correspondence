                <salute>My dear Walt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I have been too long in acknowledging the receipt of a
                newspaper containing the short poem about the Arctic singing bird.<ptr
                    target="med.00762_n1"/> It is really a thing to give thanks for&#8212;a piece of
                verse that shows poetry at its greatest. Would it be too great a favour to ask for,
                if I begged you to let me have it in your own handwriting? </p>
            <p> I suppose D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> sent you a letter I wrote him about D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Karl
                    Knortz<ptr target="uva.00476_n1"/> &amp; his judgment on my translation, which
                letter I asked him to forward to you. Since then I wrote to D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> K. explaining my views,
                and asking him if he would revise the M.S. without impairing its literality. I have
                not yet had an answer to this proposal. If he would take it up in the manner I
                suggest a really good thing might be made of it. I should earnestly like to see it
                fairly afloat &amp; before the public in Deutschland. </p>
            <p> We are settled now pro tem in the County Wicklow <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03571.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> on the lower slopes of the Wicklow
                mountains &amp; about two miles from the sea, which we have a good view of from the
                windows. We are within easy reach, by train, of Dublin. Which is advantageous for me
                as I am coming forward in the political line &amp; belong to the Dublin Young
                    Ireland Society<ptr target="loc.03571_n1"/>. Our President, John O'Leary,<ptr
                    target="loc.03571_n2"/> is a splendid fellow&#8212;a lion-like old man with long
                full grey beard, jet black 20 years ago, when he was sent to penal servitude for the
                Fenian rising in '65.<ptr target="loc.03571_n3"/> He was released after 6 years on
                condition of not returning to Ireland till '85. He is now trying to instil a
                spirit of toleration with the rather narrow and bitter patriotism of the National
                League. He and O'Donovan Rossa<ptr target="loc.03571_n4"/> were fellow prisoners! so
                strangely do men's paths diverge. </p>
            <p> I wonder if you have seen Irving act.<ptr target="loc.03571_n5"/> I used to admire
                him very much, &amp; hear he has improved lately. I have seen his Hamlet 12
                times&#8212;and each time with new interest. </p>
