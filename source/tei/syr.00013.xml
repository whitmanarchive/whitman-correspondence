                <salute>My Dear Walt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>This morning I had occasion to call at the house of a Mr. William Brough, who lives in
                a costly residence on Farragut Square and is a very pleasant, educated
                man—evidently of wealth. I saw there on the wall of his parlor a fine, large
                cut of yourself in a handsome frame. I found that he admired Drum-Taps <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr_kc.00030_large.jpg" type="verso"/>very much. I
                mentioned the proposed pension for you, and he said that if you were in need of
                assistance he thought there would be no trouble in raising a purse and that he would
                be glad to take hold of the matter if it was thought advisable. If the pension is
                not authorized I will see him again about the subscription.</p>
            <p>Eldridge<ptr target="loc.00943_n2"/> and O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> have gone to
                California to <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="syr_kc.00031_large.jpg" type="recto"/>the
                place where Dr. Channing<ptr target="loc.00945_n5"/> resides, and have arrived
                safely. I saw them off two weeks ago. O'Connor, I fear cannot hold out long, but his
                place is kept open for him here. His trouble is induration of the spinal marrow.</p>
            <p>I have been dropped out of the Govt. Service to make room for a Democrat and am
                looking about here for something to do.<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00032_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I am thinking of starting a Bureau of
                General Information. Literary, Scientific and Political, at the Capital of the
                Nation. The only question is whether I can subsist till the Bureau becomes a paying
                institution.</p>
            <p>I enclose a paragraph I cut out of the Richmond Va. Times. Let me hear from you.
                Wishing you health and happiness and long life I am,</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours sincerely</salute>
