                <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes<ptr target="loc.01626_n1"/>—&amp; in such a sudden, cruel way—poor young man—he has had a reckless unsatisfactory life—many deficiencies &amp; very shiftless—all of which I understood perfectly well—but I had an affection for him after all—Have I not heard that he had a wife &amp; child? which, (if so,) he has left—but was parted from quite a while ago—</p>
            
            <p>—Pete, so your shirts came all safe, &amp; they fit you, do they?—good—The blue shirt (did I write?) is to wear <hi rend="underline">over</hi>, loose—it is made large for that purpose—I like the looks of them, the blue shirt collar turned down low with a nice black 
                silk neck handkerchief, tied loose—over a clean white shirt without necktie—I think they are very becoming to young working-men—I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—when you hear, tell me if they came safe.—I send you some papers to-day—</p>
            
            <p>—There is nothing new with me, or my condition—My principal malady is about the same, 
                (no worse)—but I <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01626.002.jpg" type="verso"/>have had for three or four days a wretched cold in the head, 
                sore throat, most lost my voice for two days—every thing bad enough—am better rather to-day, begin to speak so I can be understood—shall be all right soon—</p>
            
            <p>—As I write, it is now between 11 and 12 a.m. Friday—it is very mild, sunshiny forenoon—I am sitting here in the parlor,—looks south, looks down a pleasant street, West street, 
                full view, makes quite a nice view for me to sit &amp; look out—the letter carrier 
                comes around in about an hour from now, &amp; takes my letters to <choice><abbr>P.O.</abbr><expan>Post Office</expan></choice>—I have become sort of acquainted with most of the carriers, ferry men, 
                car conductors &amp; drivers, &amp;c. &amp;c.—they are very good indeed—help me on &amp; off the cars, here &amp; in Philadelphia—they are nearly all young fellows—it all <choice><sic>help</sic><corr>helps</corr></choice> along—Well Pete, dear loving boy, I will bid you good bye for this week. 
            </p>
