                <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes<ptr target="loc.01626_n1"/>&#8212;&amp; in such a sudden, cruel way&#8212;poor young man&#8212;he has had a reckless unsatisfactory life&#8212;many deficiencies &amp; very shiftless&#8212;all of which I understood perfectly well&#8212;but I had an affection for him after all&#8212;Have I not heard that he had a wife &amp; child? which, (if so,) he has left&#8212;but was parted from quite a while ago&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete, so your shirts came all safe, &amp; they fit you, do they?&#8212;good&#8212;The blue shirt (did I write?) is to wear <hi rend="underline">over</hi>, loose&#8212;it is made large for that purpose&#8212;I like the looks of them, the blue shirt collar turned down low with a nice black 
                silk neck handkerchief, tied loose&#8212;over a clean white shirt without necktie&#8212;I think they are very becoming to young working-men&#8212;I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash&#8212;when you hear, tell me if they came safe.&#8212;I send you some papers to-day&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;There is nothing new with me, or my condition&#8212;My principal malady is about the same, 
                (no worse)&#8212;but I <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01626.002.jpg" type="verso"/>have had for three or four days a wretched cold in the head, 
                sore throat, most lost my voice for two days&#8212;every thing bad enough&#8212;am better rather to-day, begin to speak so I can be understood&#8212;shall be all right soon&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;As I write, it is now between 11 and 12 a.m. Friday&#8212;it is very mild, sunshiny forenoon&#8212;I am sitting here in the parlor,&#8212;looks south, looks down a pleasant street, West street, 
                full view, makes quite a nice view for me to sit &amp; look out&#8212;the letter carrier 
                comes around in about an hour from now, &amp; takes my letters to <choice><abbr>P.O.</abbr><expan>Post Office</expan></choice>&#8212;I have become sort of acquainted with most of the carriers, ferry men, 
                car conductors &amp; drivers, &amp;c. &amp;c.&#8212;they are very good indeed&#8212;help me on &amp; off the cars, here &amp; in Philadelphia&#8212;they are nearly all young fellows&#8212;it all <choice><sic>help</sic><corr>helps</corr></choice> along&#8212;Well Pete, dear loving boy, I will bid you good bye for this week.
