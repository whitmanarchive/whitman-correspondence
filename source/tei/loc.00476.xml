         <p>Tis a long time since I have heard from any of you&#8212;but I suppose all goes about
            the same as ever. I suppose you have had all sorts of newspaper rumors in regard to the
            yellow fever in St Louis<ptr target="loc.00476_n1"/>&#8212;but the truth is that the
            stories are nearly entirely fabrications Altogether
            there has been, probably, some 35 to 40 deaths by yellow fever during the
            season&#8212;out of this number some 6 or 8 were St Louis people who had been in some
            capacity about those that had come from the South&#8212;or had been connected with the
            hospital boat that carries the sick people from the city to the fever hospital. I have
            no doubt but that had the weather continued warm for a couple or three weeks longer we
            should have had quite a touch 
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad00526_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            of the trouble. From what I can observe I judge the spread
            of this disease is simply a question of time That it
            always commences in the south (so far as the West is concerned at any rate) is a
            fact&#8212;that it will progress with quite a certain rate of travel&#8212;now if the
            time between its first breaking out and where it meets a heavy frost is long enough I do
            not see why it should not spread to the lakes. This season it broke out in New Orleans

            </choice> 6 weeks earlier than usual&#8212;we have had rather a backward season as regards
            frost and cool weather&#8212;the disease was quite bad within <choice>

            </choice> 150 miles of
            us&#8212;I think more favorable conditions would undoubtedly have produced it
            here&#8212;Steamboats seem to be the home of the disease&#8212;let one of them be in the
            locality when the sickness is bad and it is pretty sure death to have anything to do
            with it&#8212;this does not seem to be the case with R. R. cars&#8212;Another thing
            seems sure and that is that with proper sanitary laws&#8212;with good energetic health
            officers&#8212;no city that is kept decently clean but what can stamp out the disease by
            taking prompt action</p>

         <p>I do not know that you are interested in all this, but I have been pretty well exercised
            about the matter, knowing that if it did come here I should have to stop and face the
            music no matter how bad it became&#8212;We have had several cool nights&#8212;and to-day
            the weather is what might be called cold&#8212;I think we will have a decided show of
            ice to-night&#8212;and so the question of fever for this season is certainly disposed
            of.</p><!--xxx here.-->
         <p>I am getting on reasonably well have pretty good health&#8212;indeed just now it is
            extremely good&#8212;at one time&#8212;near the latter part of July I got <choice>

            the bad air of the numerous sewers, bone boiling and fat rendering establishments that I
            had to visit<ptr target="loc.00476_n2"/> and was badly off for a couple of
            weeks&#8212;and indeed did not feel well until we had a "cold wave" about two weeks
            ago&#8212;since that time I have felt the very best&#8212;and too my work has let up
            very much</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_ad00528_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
         <p>How are you all getting on How is George and Lou and Ed and yourself&#8212;I hope you
            continue to gain&#8212;I judge from what Hattie writes that you made quite headway this
            last summer I hope so and am very glad. What is new with you are you doing anything in
            the way of books&#8212;I dont see anything in the papers<ptr target="loc.00476_n3"
            />&#8212;but then the papers I see would not be apt to say much anyhow&#8212;except in a
            mean way. Has George got through his foundry work&#8212;and if so I suppose is mostly on
            his farm<ptr target="loc.00476_n4"/>&#8212;Will you make a winter trip to your New York
            friends if so you must call and see Worthen<ptr target="loc.00476_n5"/> I have just
            had a letter from Hattie in which I learn that she is a little sick&#8212;has been laid
            off from study&#8212;I hope she is not sick to any extent&#8212;indeed I sincerely hope
            she is all right now&#8212;I have just written her to-night to let the study go and get
            well as quick as she can&#8212;I hope to hear in a day or two that she is all well
            again</p>
         <p>Give my love to all&#8212;write me when you feel like it and give me all the news.&#8212;</p>
