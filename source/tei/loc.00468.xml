            <p>When I wrote you yesterday I had not had time to read your last letter but when I went home and gave it to Mattie the thought that you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> yet come to see her made her feel very happy  It seems to be the one desire of her life to have you come and see her&#8212;she rested much better last night&#8212;her throat is better and her cough better but she has the most intense pain in her side and shoulder and arm&#8212;One side and breast is so swollen that it makes her quite one-sided and the pain most all the time is terrible severe&#8212;</p>
            <p>What do you think about the trip? I am sure we can make you very comfortable here&#8212;and I believe you could come through without hardly knowing it&#8212;at the same time if George could he might come with you&#8212;</p>
            <p>You would not need to make any preparation for the journey&#8212;you would find a colored porter on the car that would bring you your meals&#8212;you could have the table put up in the section and eat as if you were at home&#8212;</p>
            <p>If Mat was well enough I would come for you&#8212;but as it is I cannot leave her&#8212;</p>
            <p>The children are very good and as well as can be&#8212;</p>
            <p>I will write again soon  write me and tell [me] what you think about coming</p>
            <p>Love to Loo and George</p>
