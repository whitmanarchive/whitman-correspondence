            <p>I own the Stereotype plates of your Poem, "Leaves of Grass" I bought them of the assigness of Thayer &amp; Eldridge at the time of their failure. I should like to sell them &amp; did not know but you would like to purchase if you could get them at the right figure. I do not know what they cost, but my impression is, that it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $800. I would be pleased to have you state what you would give for them, or to know if you could refer me to any publisher who would be likely to purchase. I think you could make better arrangements with publishers if <pb facs="yal.00101.002.jpg" type="verso"/>you owned the Stereotype plates</p>
