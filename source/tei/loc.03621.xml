            <p>This day I have obtained a P.O. order for &#163;4.12. payable to you.<ptr target="n0522"/> The order (as you are aware) does not pass thro' my own hands.</p>
            
            <p>Of the &#163;4.12, half is the money of Mr. Cozens, to whom you have already sent the books. The other half is from a new subscriber, Jas. Anderson Rose,<ptr target="n0916"/> 11 Salisbury St., London, W.C.&#8212;He is a solicitor of some note, once Under-Sheriff of London, brother of an Alderman

            who has been Lord Mayor; is besides a great collector of engravings &amp; other works of artistic (or literary) interest. He does not <hi rend="underline">know</hi> your writings, but seems sincerely desirous of making some acquaintance with them.</p>
           
            <p><choice><abbr>Wd.</abbr><expan>Would</expan></choice> you kindly tell Mrs. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0259"/> that I have by me a letter of hers (undated) <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> was presented to me a month or so ago by a Mr. Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/>&#8212;who paid two long visits at my house, &amp; whom I liked much, obtaining from him numerous details that interested me extremely regarding yourself &amp; the Gilchrists. I <choice><abbr>wd</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice>

            have written to Mrs. G before now, but for incessant occupations, &amp; in the last 2 <choice><abbr>mos.</abbr><expan>months</expan></choice> much anxiety regarding my brother's state of health. He was lately in a bad way, requiring a severe surgical operation; &amp;, <choice><abbr>tho</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> that went off rightly, he does not rally adequately, &amp; I feel by no means confident as to the final result. One great object has been to get him out of town to some suitable seaside house: I am in hopes that today this will be accomplished, more or less well. Please also tell Mrs. G that a son was born to me on 28 Feb: he &amp; the little girl (<choice><abbr>tho</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> the boy did at one time alarm us much) go on well, &amp; are

                <p>I <choice><abbr>shd</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> have said that the &#163;4.12. was the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> money now actually in my hands on your account. Have not heard from Dowden<ptr target="n0199"/> since I wrote you last.</p>
