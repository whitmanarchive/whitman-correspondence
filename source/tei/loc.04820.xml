            <p>I hope that this will find you in better health than when you wrote last.<ptr target="loc.04820_n5"/>&#8212;If the cool weather
                here is anything to go by you will at last have had a diminution of the oppressive heat.</p>
                <p>Cool, showery weather here, with one or two days this week of strong winds &#38; positively
                <hi rend="underline">cold</hi> for the time of year.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01912_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>Clear, cool evening tonight. Last night specially fine, with glorious sunset.</p>
            <p>D<hi rend="underline">r</hi>. Johnston<ptr target="n4102"/> &#38; his brother<ptr target="loc.04820_n3"/> (from Scotland) M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> 
                Johnston<ptr target="loc.04820_n4"/> &#38; a lady
                friend of hers,<ptr target="n5001"/> went off at noon to the Isle of Man. They are staying at a house Johnston &#38; I
                have stayed at before&#8212;a house at once boarding-house &#38; farm. It is situated
                on the west coast, 5 miles from the little town of Peel. It is away from the tourist haunts,
                in the most beautiful region of the Island. The farm slopes
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01913_large.jpg" type="recto"/>   
                up from the sea (the house 2 fields away) with rugged hills behind, with wooded glens &#38;c.
                The coast&#8212;curving outwards like a wide shallow bay&#8212;is very rocky &#38; precipitous, 
                with steep hills, &#38; narrow winding bays or creeks. Ireland visible on
                clear days, or at sundown&#8212;the lighthouse at Point of <choice><orig>Ayr</orig><reg>Ayre</reg></choice>, Scotland, visible at night. 
                Scanty population of farmers &#38; fishermen, simple unsophisticated &#38; hospitable. (Have several
                friends amongst them.) Boating, fishing &#38; one or two good places for bathing
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01914_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                (au naturel). Rocks on shore, with innumerable pools, a paradise at ebb tide for a naturalist.
                Purest &#38; sweetest air&#8212;an almost ideal place for bodily &#38; mental rest &#38; recuperation,
                alone (or nearly so) with mountain &#38; sea, &#38; the innocent farm pursuits.</p>
                <p>Doubtless Johnston will write you at length about it all &#38; send you photographs of the place &#38; people.</p>
                <p>I imagine him at this moment, newly arrived, &#38; good old motherly M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi>
                    Teare<ptr target="loc.04820_n6"/> ministering to him &#38; the rest. (First visit of M<hi rend="underline">rs</hi> Johnston and the rest).</p>
                <p>We were there 4 years ago, &#38; a rare good time we had!
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01915_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    We were there at the end of harvest &#38; came in for the Manx "m&#275;lya"<ptr target="loc.04820_n7"/>&#8212;all the farm servants, &#38; neighbors coming into supper, 
                    &#38; then adjourning to the barn, where to the
                light of 2 or 3 candles Johnston played a fiddle &#38; the rest of us danced &#38; romped about in hilarious games.</p>
                <p>What good times J. &#38; I had <hi rend="underline">alone</hi>, too, down at the foot of the cliffs, amongst the rocks,
                    &#38; elsewhere, reading L. of G. "Sea Drift"<ptr target="loc.04820_n2"/> &#38;c.&#8212;not to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>And the talks with fishermen&#8212;old John Gow,<ptr target="n5001"/> for instance, with his rheumatism, &#38; his reminiscences
                of wrecks on that coast. And down at old
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01916_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                Ann Watterson's<ptr target="n5001"/> little cabin nestled in among the rocks right on the shore, 
                fullfronting the bay,&#8212;with Bradda Head, <choice><sic>Cronk-ny-ira-la</sic><corr>Cronk ny Arrey Laa</corr></choice>, the Calf of Man,
                Fleshwick Bay &#38;c in grand panorama, &#38; the everpresent sound of the sea.</p>
            <p>The harvesting, boating &#38;c. and one visit to the quaint little church (about as big as your room) the parson<ptr target="n5001"/> ringing the bell
                to summon his people, the quaint congregation, with their simple <hi rend="underline">unconventional</hi> ways &#38;c.</p>
                <p>I was there again the following spring for 4 days, and two years ago I spent 3 weeks there.&#8212;Johnston
                with me the first time, &#38; visiting me the second time.</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01917_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                <p>Blessings on them all! And may Johnston &#38; his party enjoy <hi rend="underline">their holiday.</hi></p>
