            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friend Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>I received your large and kind letter in due time &amp; was glad to hear that you <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> well &amp; enjoying your self. I was out on pass the day your letter come and when I came in &amp; they gave it me I thought that it was a <choice><sic>furlow</sic><corr>furlough</corr></choice>, or a discharge or <hi rend="italic">something better yet</hi>, a commission as a Colonel or <choice><sic>Brigadear</sic><corr>Brigadier</corr></choice> General, to <hi rend="italic">command Armory Square Hosp</hi>&#8212;but as it was it pleased me more than any, for I care more for a letter from you than I would for a Com.</p>
            <p>Now I suppose that you would like to know how I enjoy my self: Well I go out most every day but I do not get them big dinners that I <choice><sic>ues</sic><corr>use</corr></choice> to. &amp; I feel quite lost without you hear, but I must be contented to let you remain at home on <choice><sic>furlow</sic><corr>furlough</corr></choice> for a short time, for when you get back I want you to attend Congress with me, as I am a going up to hear the speaking whenever I can get out&#8212;(which is <choice><sic>prety</sic><corr>pretty</corr></choice> often now) I have not bin up to the N. York dining rooms but once since you left so I do not know how things is getting along <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice>.</p>
         <p>Things in the Hospital has maid quite a <choice><sic>chaing</sic><corr>change</corr></choice>. it has <choice><sic>bin</sic><corr>been</corr></choice> filled up with wounded since you left. in this ward we had three Colonels and one Major &amp; one <choice><sic>Adjudant</sic><corr>Adjutant</corr></choice> General and several other commissioned officers amongst <choice><sic>whome</sic><corr>whom</corr></choice> <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> two <choice><sic>Rebble</sic><corr>rebel</corr></choice> <choice><sic>Lieutenents</sic><corr>Lieutenants</corr></choice>&#8212;and three reb privates! but to day the rebs <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> all sent off that <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> able to go, so we have no rebs in this ward, but <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> is some in some of the other wards!&#8212;Two of the Colonels and all of the rest of the commissioned officers that were able to be <choice><sic>transfered</sic><corr>transferred</corr></choice>: were <choice><sic>transfered</sic><corr>transferred</corr></choice> to the Hospital at Georgetown, so we <choice><sic>aint</sic><corr>ain't</corr></choice> got so many shoulder <choice><sic>strapes</sic><corr>straps</corr></choice> hear, but we have got enough <hi rend="italic">yet for my use</hi>. I think that this last battle has bin a <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> hard battle, but it has bin a decided victory although it has cost a many a life for <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> was a great many of our men killed &amp; wounded</p>
         <p>The rebs that was in this ward were <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> saucy. they <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> as confident of gaining their indapendance as we as of whipping them. they say that they have got plenty to eat and wear, (but I thought by the look of them that they had not enough to ware for they <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> ragged) or maybe they but on <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> old clothes to fight in. (I forgot to ask em that)</p>
            <p>Saturday morning 14th</p>
            <p>I will commence writing again. My leg is rather worse this morning &amp; the Doctor <choice><sic>sayes</sic><corr>says</corr></choice> that I must stay in bed to day, so I suppose that I must spend the day in bed the best way I can so I will write you another <choice><sic>sheat</sic><corr>sheet</corr></choice> full
Well this is <choice><sic>saturday</sic><corr>Saturday</corr></choice> &amp; they are a scrubbing the floor. so it will be wet hear all forenoon, so I think that I will be as well in bead as any place else, so I must lay and content myself&#8212;Now I suppose that you would like to hear something about the boys that <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> home on <choice><sic>furlow</sic><corr>furlough</corr></choice>. Sargent Denison<ptr target="tex.00136_n2"/> has got back&#8212;H. Benton<ptr target="tex.00136_n3"/> has not got back yet although his <choice><sic>furlow</sic><corr>furlough</corr></choice> was out the 10th, several others of the boys has got back that went home to vote&#8212;I received a letter from Bush since he went home. he is well and enjoying him self, he <choice><sic>sayes</sic><corr>says</corr></choice>, he sent a great deal of love to you &amp; said that he was a going to write to you, so I expect that <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> is a letter hear for you now from him
(Your letter I did not do quite with it as you told me. that is I did not take it to each one, but I took it to the lady nurse of each ward &amp; told her to read it her self (which she did in public) and then to pass it to each one of the men that <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> mentioned in it, for them to read, and than to let each one read it that wanted to so when that was don I would carry it to the next ward and do the <choice><sic>saim</sic><corr>same</corr></choice> with it <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> and so on all through the Hosp. It was in every ward and they all read it that wanted to amongst the rest Dr. Draper<ptr target="tex.00136_n4"/> read it&#8212;they were all <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> much pleased with it)&#8212;
All of the old patients are a getting along well&#8212;but <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> is a good many deaths amongst those that <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> brought in last. they are all <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> badly wounded. and the most of them are wounded in the body or head. <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> are <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> few wounded in the legs (but some are) That man in ward A that had the Consumption that <choice><sic>layed</sic><corr>laid</corr></choice> just above the middle door&#8212;is still living, he looks better than he did that night when I seen you up <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> that man with the bad arm &amp; that man with the bad <choice><sic>leges</sic><corr>legs</corr></choice> are mending&#8212;in fact <choice><sic>thay</sic><corr>they</corr></choice> are all doing so well as they can&#8212;They have just began to build the <choice><sic>Chapple</sic><corr>Chapel</corr></choice> &amp; Library that <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> has bin so much talk about, this morning but if they are as long about getting it finished as they were a getting the floor in this ward it will take them <hi rend="italic">three years or during the war</hi>.&#8212;then it will not be of much use; <hi rend="italic">will it</hi>
Well Dear friend I hardly know what else to write to interest you but I will put in something&#8212;We still have Miss Lowell<ptr target="tex.00136_n5"/> hear to run this ward &amp; she is worse than ever since we have got these <hi rend="italic">shoulder straps</hi> she does not <choice><sic>alow</sic><corr>allow</corr></choice> me to walk over the floor nor to speak nor nothing else. she <choice><sic>eaven</sic><corr>even</corr></choice> has a guard to set at each door to keep out the visitors that comes. when a visitor comes he has to send in his <hi rend="italic">card</hi> to let Miss Lowell see who it is  then sometimes he is <choice><sic>admited</sic><corr>admitted</corr></choice> sometimes he is sent away. <hi rend="italic">So you had better set a pack of cards struck off to use when you come back, or maybe Miss Lowell will not be for letting you in.</hi>
Well I think my letter is getting full long as I must begin to think about closing. I do not expect that you can read one half of it for it is so carelessly wrote and spelt, but what you cannot read you must guess at&#8212;that is if you are a <choice><sic>yankey</sic><corr>Yankee</corr></choice> for they are good at guessing&#8212;but I must not call you a <choice><sic>yankey</sic><corr>Yankee</corr></choice> you are to honest for to be one The weather is splendid hear <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> different from what it was this time last year it is <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> warm we have had but one or two cold disagreeable days.&#8212; I expect that they will have the <choice><sic>Godress</sic><corr>Godess</corr></choice> of Liberty <choice><sic>summounted</sic><corr>mounted</corr></choice> on the Capitol as they have maid great progress with it lately. they have got the scaffold all up&#8212;I have not bin up to the Capitol for some time, but <choice><sic>probily</sic><corr>probably</corr></choice> I will go up on Monday if my leg is better.
</p>
            <p>Well as I have wrote short enough this time I will close hoping <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> soon to hear from you&#8212;all the boys join me in sending <choice><sic>thear</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> love to you &amp; your Mother. so good by and may God bless you, from your friend and <choice><sic>Compainion</sic><corr>Companion</corr></choice>, Lewis K. Brown.</p>
            <p>Write soon &amp; oblige LKB. I understood yesterday that <choice><sic>Elija</sic><corr>Elijah</corr></choice> Fox has not <choice><sic>gon</sic><corr>gone</corr></choice> home yet, but I did not see him</p>
