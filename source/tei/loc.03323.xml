                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Happy New Year!</p>
            <p>I send you the article on Mrs Gilchrist's book from the <hi rend="underline"
                    >Nation</hi>, for which I have never ceased hunting, and which I found where it
                had no business to be. You will observe that the holy Father sprinkles us with an
                aspergillus full of ice water. The cold impudence of that <hi rend="underline"
                    >Nation</hi> surpasses.</p>
            <p>Sometime when you are sending you can return me the article for my collection.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03323.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I have for some time wanted to write to you, but have been strangely ill, and only
                just able to walk through the office duties. I keep up my spirits as well as I can,
                but find it all pretty depressing.</p>
            <p>The article by the wretch named Willard<ptr target="loc.03323_n1"/> in the American
                Magazine filled me with indignation. What a beast a man must be who comes to you
                with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a
                magazine!</p>
            <p>I hope you have read "King Solomon's Mines."<ptr target="loc.03323_n3"/> It is
                immense. I have read it forty times, I do believe. The battle chapters let one into
                the spirit of Homer as the translations cannot do. <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.03323.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> I wish somebody would rightly
                review it for the benefit of the Boston school.</p>
            <p>I see the little pieces you send forth. "Yonnondio" is beautiful.<ptr
                    target="loc.03323_n2"/> The Boston <hi rend="underline">Advertiser</hi>, which
                also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of
                tribute.&#8212;I think your term, "Shakespeare-Bacon,"<ptr target="loc.03323_n4"/>
                will stick to Verulam.<ptr target="loc.03323_n5"/> Donnelly<ptr target="n4108"/> is,
                I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him
                since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.</p>
            <p>I hope you are keeping reasonably well. Au revoir.</p>
