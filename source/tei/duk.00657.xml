        <salute>Dear Charley,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have now been a week here, &amp; am about the same&#8212;well enough to keep up and around, 
        but with bad spells most every day, &amp; sometimes very bad ones. My head does not get 
        right, that being still the trouble&#8212;the feeling now being as if it were in the 
        centre of the head, heavy &amp; painful &amp; quite pervading&#8212;locomotion about the same&#8212;no better. I keep pretty good spirits, however, &amp; still make my calculations on getting well.</p>
      
      <p>I am pleasantly situated here&#8212;have two nice rooms, second floor, with windows north 
        &amp; south, if there is any air. They are the rooms in which my mother died, 
        with all the accustomed furniture, I have long been so used to see. 
        I am quite satisfied here, so far&#8212;Sleep good, &amp; appetite sufficient. 
        It has been warm weather here, but I have stood it fairly. I hear by your letter 
        &amp; the papers it has been very oppressively hot in Washington. Today, as I write, 
        it is cloudy &amp; cooler here. I have not felt well enough yet to strike out for Atlantic City.</p>
      
      <p>Charley, I rec'd your letter Saturday, with the one enclosed. (It was a very kind 
        sympathetic note from Kate Hillard.)<ptr target="duk.00657_n1"/> I have written to Harry Douglas, my fellow clerk in the office, 
        asking him to send me my letters here under frank from the office, till July 1st&#8212;I am glad to hear Nelly is feeling better&#8212;I hope quite well&#8212;I send my best love to her&#8212;please hand her this letter to read&#8212;Nelly, I still feel that I shall pull through, 
        but O it is a weary, weary pull&#8212;&amp; when I have these spells in the head that still afflict me, 
        it requires all my phlegm. My lift at the Ashton's was a great help to me&#8212;the change from the 15th st. rooms, &amp; then the weather being so favorable&#8212;the change here is so far good, too&#8212;As soon as I get a little stronger, 
        &amp; free from head-distress, I shall go down to Atlantic City&#8212;Remember me to Dr. Drinkard 
        if you see him, &amp; if you have a good chance, read to him what I have said of my case&#8212;if he has any suggestions, write me&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Charley, I have amused myself with <hi rend="italic">Kenelm Chilinglly</hi>&#8212;read it all&#8212;like it well&#8212;Bulwer is <hi rend="italic">such a snob</hi> as almost redeems snobdom&#8212;the story is good, 
        &amp; the style a master's&#8212;Like Cervantes, Bulwer's old-age-productions 
        are incomparably his best. Send me a Chronicle occasionally.
