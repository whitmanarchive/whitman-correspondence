            <p>With your letter came one from O'Connor bursting with wrath; I think I will enclose
                it to you. No doubt he will be a host there in <choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>Washington</expan></choice> &#38; will reach that

                </choice> yet. Tis a pity Osgood has not got some pluck &#38; so make a fight. No
                doubt we could beat them to tatters, &#38; make a big strike for the book Write
                &#38; ask him if he will

                     fight if he is well backed up. It is the last thing I ever
                dreamed of. If this is the wish of Boston then I pray for her purification by a fire ten times bigger than the
                fire of a few years ago.</p>
            <p>I enclose my <choice><abbr>ck.</abbr><expan>check</expan></choice> for the <choice><abbr>amt.</abbr><expan>amount</expan></choice> you ask for, &#36;100.</p>
            <p>What a blank there in New England! To me Emerson filled nearly the whole horizon in
                that direction. But I suppose it is better so, tho' the very sunlight seems
                darkened. I should have gone to his funeral had I not had so much to do before
                sailing for England.

                     I wrote a page on him for the Critic, yesterday, tho' I may be
                too late.</p>
            <p>If our passage was not paid to England, I should not go. I am ashamed to go off at
                such a time. I have had no heart for the trip from the first, &#38; now the death of
                Emerson (how those few words penetrate me!) &#38; your troubles, make me want to
                stay at home more than ever.</p>
            <p>If you have Mrs Gilchrist's address send it me; also that of Mr. Carpenter.</p>
            <p>I have written an essay on Carlyle which I think goes to the heart of him more than
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01140.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> anything I
                have seen. I spoke to your <hi rend="underline">North American Review</hi> man about it on
                Friday, but he did not bite; said it was not in his line, &#38;c. I shall probably
                offer it in London.</p>
            <p>If you do not hear from me again anything addressed to me care Henderson Brothers
                Glasgow, 49 &#38; 51 Union Street will be forwarded to me. We land at Glasgow &#38;
                shall stay there a few days.</p>
