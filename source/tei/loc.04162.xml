            <p>I send you here two stanzas written by me and addressed to you.<ptr target="n0832"/> I have taken this
                liberty at the suggestion of my uncle Mr Symonds,<ptr target="loc.04162_n1"/> to whom I showed the verses, and by
                whom I was assured that my sending them would not be looked upon by you in the light
                of an impertinence. With the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00310_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> exception of a single line they are just as I wrote them two
                years ago some few weeks after your book first fell into my hands Mr Symonds <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">bids</unclear> me
                tell you something of myself. I was born in the year 1860. I am second son of what
                is here called a "country-gentleman" I have never been to any of our great public
                schools, but have got the little I know of the classics under various <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00311_large.jpg" type="recto"/>private tutors. I
                hope by next <choice>

                    <corr>Christmas</corr>
                </choice> to have entered Balliol College Oxford. Owing to my want of a public-school training, I have not as yet been able to do much in the way of athletics I
                hope however when I get up to Oxford to do some rowing. With many hopes that you
                continue better in health</p>
