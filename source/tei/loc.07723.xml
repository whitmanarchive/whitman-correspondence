                <p>
                    I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the "impalpable nudge" to write to me. Thy card has 
                    come<ptr target="loc.01390_n1"/> to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits &amp; discouraged. I have been quite ill all
                    summer&#8212;"over-work," "nervous prostration," the rest&#8212;&amp; in
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01390.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    spite of many weeks of tedious "absolute rest," I am worse &amp; not better, &amp; now I have to go off for I don't know
                    how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband<ptr target="n6114"/> &amp; the two little ones<ptr target="loc.01390_n2"/> in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright
                    spot is that mother is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me&#8212;it reminds me that absence is not the
                    end of everything
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01390.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    &amp; it sings, without the definite words, the "Song of the Open Road." My road has seemed so shut up&#8212;I am laid 
                    aside in the midst of all the work I care for&#8212;fit for nothing&#8212;and oh! the horror of feeling one's
                    <hi rend="underline">mind</hi>, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read 
                    or study or write or do anything I cared
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.01390.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    to all summer long. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But thy remembrance reminds me not to complain, &amp; thy example encourages me to keep sound in spirits&#8212;"which 
                    is the main thing." Thank thee for writing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will write from the Pyrennees in a few days&#8212;&amp; I hope I shall not be so egotistic &amp; gloomy. I am sure
                    thee will have seen Alys by this time &amp; that she will have told thee all our news.
