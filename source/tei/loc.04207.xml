                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Pray forgive my long silence.<ptr target="loc.04207_n1"/> I have been deep in troubles of my own. All the books have arrived and been safely transmitted. Many thanks.</p>
            
            <p>You have doubtless heard about affairs in England. The tone adopted by certain of your friends here became so unpleasant that I requested all subscriptions etc. to be paid over to Rossetti,<ptr target="n0522"/> and received no more myself. During a certain lawsuit against the Examiner, your admirers&#8212;notably Mr. Swinburne<ptr target="n0610"/>&#8212;pleaded against me that I had praised <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, cited <hi rend="italic">your</hi> words against me in court etc. I never was so shocked and astonished, for I would not have believed human beings capable of such iniquity.</p>
            
            <p>As I think I told you before, I shall ever regret the insertion of certain passages in your books (Children of Adam<ptr target="loc.04207_n2"/> etc). I do not believe them necessary or defensible. These passages are quoted as being the work of an immoral writer, and, <choice><orig>altho'</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> I tried to show they were part of a system of philosophy, it would not do. I know the purity and righteousness of your meaning, but that does not alter my regret.</p>
            
            <p>I think your reputation is growing here, and I am sure it deserves to grow. But your fatal obstacle to general influence is the obnoxious passages. I wish you would make up your mind to excise them with your own hand.</p>
            
            <p>God bless you!&#8212;May your trouble lift, and may happy days be in store for you!&#8212;Let me know about your affairs. I may soon be in a position to help you more definitely.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute rend="right">Yours ever,</salute>
