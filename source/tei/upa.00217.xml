            <p>I like with all my heart (&amp; head too) "A memorandum at a venture". It is as clear as daylight to me that you speak truth—invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope &amp; promise &amp; impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in this truth since it burst upon me a veritable

                sunrise in reading your poems in 1869—each part of those poems necessary to the whole—It would indeed be betraying a great cause a sacred trust to cancel what is now once more attacked.</p>
            
            <p>I cannot think the smallest harm of any kind, even pecuniary, (except to the men themselves who thus expose the nature of their thoughts)—will come of it. I do not think you will sell one less copy, &amp; I suppose you will have a larger

            share of the profits. I am very glad you have written these clear strong words for the North American.</p>
            <p>A real pleasure it is to see John Burroughs—both for your sake—for it seems in a kind of way almost like seeing you—&amp; for his own. What eyes he has for the ways of the whole dumb world. He has gone just now to my favorite Haslemere, in quest of nightingales—&amp; I hope

            will make the acquaintance of an excellent friend of mine there to whom I gave an introduction Unluckily Herby is away—painting some portraits in Monmouthshire with which he has succeeded well. He has also sold his Academy picture—&amp; will be back in time to see John Burroughs on his way <choice><abbr>thro'</abbr><expan>through</expan></choice> <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="8"/>. Ah if you had but come with him! Best love from Giddy &amp; I.</p>
