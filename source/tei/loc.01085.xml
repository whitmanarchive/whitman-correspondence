                tried very hard to secure a copy of your "Leaves", and at last in New York did so, I
                took the book up and ran my eyes over detached lines uninterestedly because carelessly: at last
                I came to a poem ("24"&#8212;page 242 Thayer &amp; Eldridge edition) that brought me
                to a stand-still and as I read and reread the lines I felt&#8212;I, the

                not understand you all in all fully, but I recognize the manliness of you, the power
                you possess, the strength of mind and limb&#8212;and, <unclear reason="illegible"
