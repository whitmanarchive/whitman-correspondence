                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I was delighted yesterday morning to receive your kind post card 
                of Dec<hi rend="underline">br</hi>: 23<hi rend="underline">rd</hi>,<ptr target="loc.04966_n2"/> &amp; I thank you for it with all my heart.</p>
            <p>I was very much pleased to note the rather better report of your health at the time
                of writing:—("pretty fair—considering")—
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02218_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                &amp; of your having been out the previous day.</p>
            <p>This morning, I had the further pleasure of receiving a letter from 
                D<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Johnston,<ptr target="n4102"/>
                enclosing copies of your P.C. to him &amp; of a letter from Horace L. Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> 
                dated Dec<hi rend="underline">br</hi>: 25<hi rend="underline">th</hi>, which 
                confirmed the glad news of your improved condition.</p>
            <p>I was also very much pleased to receive a copy of <hi rend="underline">"The New Ideal"</hi><ptr target="loc.04966_n4"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02219_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                for Dec<hi rend="underline">br</hi>, and one of <hi rend="underline">"Unity"</hi><ptr target="loc.04966_n3"/> 
                for August 28<hi rend="underline">th</hi>;—both very kindly sent by
                Traubel at your suggestion. I will write to him tonight (though briefly) to thank him.</p>
            <p>I note your description of your solitude &amp;c, relieved "once in a while" by
                "something or somebody that <hi rend="underline">cheers</hi> you," &amp; I wish that
                 <hi rend="underline">I</hi> could do something better to cheer you than writing
                stupid letters. But I can only do "as they" are said to "do in Chowbent" 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.02220_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                (a village near Bolton)—viz:—the best they can!</p>
            <p>Indeed, I am doing very little in any way at present. I am still suffering from
                exhaustion of brain &amp; nerves, which is very slow to quit, &amp; which, while it
                lasts, prevents me from doing any thing beyond my necessary work.</p>
            <p>Even the society of friends ("the College"<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/>) of which I was the founder &amp; leader,
                &amp; which met at our house while we lived in Bolton, has seen very little of me this winter</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.02221_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <note type="editorial" place="top" resp="#ht"> March 7th '91 note</note>
            <p>Both in it, &amp; in literary work besides, I have been anxious to extend your
                influence &amp; to help on your work. And I trust that in good time, &amp; by God's
                help, I shall be able to do so—perhaps all the better for my present
                inactivity.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, it is my proudest &amp; dearest privilege to write to you, &amp; to shew
                you something—(if nothing better) of a love which is as that of a son, &amp;
                of the gratitude &amp; homage due to my greatest benefactor &amp; exemplar.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.02222_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>As I read your postcard, &amp; thought of you sitting alone in your room, (in your
                big chair—with wolfskin,) writing &amp; reading—"or rather going through the
                motions"—I wished that I could sit with you, &amp; read aloud for you what you
                wished, &amp; write as you dictated. How <hi rend="underline">gladly</hi> would I do
                so if I only could!</p>
            <p>But I have to content myself with looking up at your portrait which looks down upon
                me from the mantelpiece &amp; writing as I can.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.02223_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I am most heartily glad that you begin the New Year under improved conditions of
                health—(or seemed <hi rend="underline">likely</hi> to do so at Christmas.)
                I devoutly hope that as the year goes on it may bring you increasing strength &amp;
                immunity from pain, inspirations of nobler cheer &amp; trust &amp; love, with wider
                &amp; deeper returns of the love you have poured forth in such a measureless &amp;
                lifelong flood—&amp; that 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_vm.02224_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                your eyes may be gladdened with visible beginnings of the noble
                harvest yet to come to the burning seeds of faith &amp; joy &amp; love 
                you have so diligently planted.</p>
            <p>With heartfelt, deepest thanks for all your benefits—&amp; for all your personal
                loving-kindness—to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>, &amp; with responding love,
                gratitude &amp; reverence always.</p>
