            <p>I return herewith the printed slips with Dr. Knortz's
                    translations.<ptr target="loc.05536_n1"/> That of the 'Out of the Cradle
                endlessly Rocking' is of really splendid power, &#38; would be perfect but for
                some curious failures to understand the English&#8212;e.g. 'that <hi
                    rend="underline">low</hi> and delicious word'&#8212;low is translated
                'gemein' (= vulgar) instead of 'leise' (low in sound, tone). 'Absorbing' is rendered
                'absorbed in thought'&#8212;the <hi rend="underline">word</hi> stronger and
                sweeter than any' he has read as 'world'! &amp;c. I have translated the said poem, and was just
                writing the last two or three lines, when the cannons boomed and bells rang
                announcing the New Year last night. I got your postcard, &#38; sent copies to Dr.
                K. and Schmidt. The latter has kindly sent me something of his in return, which
                unfortunately I can't read, not knowing Danish.<ptr target="loc.05536_n2"/> But it
                has such a tantalising resemblance to German that I mean to learn it&#8212;enough
                for reading purposes. Many thanks for the copy of the Critic, <choice><abbr>recd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> yesterday.<ptr
                    target="loc.05536_n3"/> Matt. Arnold himself said that he feared he should see
                little or nothing of the real America, &#38; he is right.<ptr
                    target="loc.05536_n4"/> The misery of the poorer classes in England is fast
                reaching <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_af.01053_large.jpg" type="verso"/>the
                <hi rend="underline">in</hi>tolerable point &#38; friends there say there is certainly a tremendous
                catastrophe &#38; overturn impending. Fortunately such a thing is not likely to
                prove fruitless, if it does happen, for people know now pretty well what they
                want&#8212;that is&#8212;State guarantee that as long as there is food in a
                community, no person willing to work, shall want. That is to say, society to be
                organized on the human, not on the wild-beast principle. "The Age of Feudalism" says
                Carlyle "perished&#8212;having produced the still more indomitable Age of Hunger."
                And the Age of Hunger will prove more indomitable than that of 'Competition' too. I
                wonder do you know a man called Carpenter (Edward),<ptr target="n0141b"/> lives in
                England, has written a book called '<hi rend="underline">Towards Democracy</hi>' of which he will surely have
                sent you a copy?<ptr target="loc.05536_n5"/> He is doing much good work
                there&#8212;issues pamphlets, lectures, &amp;c. against the Tyranny of
                capitalism&#8212;Is it not certain that you in America will have all this to go
                through some day when you get more densely populated &#38; the squeeze begins? And
                wouldn't it be well to put things on a right footing <hi rend="underline">now</hi>,
                instead of waiting till vested interests, &amp;c. accumulate &#38; force justice
                &#38; charity to appear in the guise of avenging angels?</p>
