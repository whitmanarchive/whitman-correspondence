                <salute>Dear Walt&#8212;:.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yes; i.e. Baxter<ptr target="n6000"/> wrote me an indignant letter&#8212;enclosing clipping fr. some N. Y.
                paper&#8212;a hifalutin journalese acc't of the Japanese's outrageous act. It seems,
                then, that the set of the alleged conversations with you which he gave me was only a
                copy: I have them now somewhere. The duplicate wh. he retained he has pub.<hi
                    rend="underline">d</hi>,&#8212;where I can't quite make out, N. Y. Herald I
                suppose you mean.<ptr target="loc.03000_n2"/> We were very sorry for yr sake: the damage done is irreparable I
                suppose. You remember, I wrote &#38; warned you that the fellow tried to pub. these
                things. We were both of us&#8212;you &#38; I&#8212;too careless. I should have tho't
                that he might have a duplicate, &#38; your good nature sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi> not
                have hindered you writing him peremptorily &#38; severely not to pub.&#8212;However,
                with all my deep chagrin, I c<hi rend="underline">d</hi> but laugh (long &#38; well),
                over little Stedman<ptr target="n1043"/> &#38; Holmes (I suppose the Holmes bit came out
                too). What the frantic-for-notoriety pap. reports is true as gospel, whether you
                said it or not. How w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> it do for me to send to Stedman the
                card I rec'd fr. you anent yr alleged opinion of him &#224; la Hartmann,<ptr
                    target="n4980"/> (in which card you say good things of Stedman, &#38; deny that you
                hold the Hartmannian opinion) how wd it do for me to send this to Stedman? <hi
                    rend="underline">I</hi> was not going to mention the matter to you or to St.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03000.002.jpg" type="verso"/> But since it has come
                out so publicly, this card w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> serve as a sort of rebuttal
                &#38; <hi rend="underline">amende</hi> perhaps. You say in it "as to my alleged opinion
                of Stedman: I have no such opinion.<ptr target="loc.03000_n1"/> My feeling toward S. is one of good will &#38;
                thanks markedly&#8212;O'C<ptr target="n2002"/> says he is a good fellow, &#38; I say so too."</p>
            <p>But no: I w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> not dare to send this card. Stedman w<hi
                    rend="underline">d</hi> never forgive my <hi rend="underline">trying to comfort
                    him</hi>. Ha! ha! The worst of the damnable business is that it sh<hi
                    rend="underline">d</hi> come so close on the heels of that at bottom
                warm-hearted (if conceited &#38; patronizing&#8212;slightly&#8212;) letter of S's to
                you. Hang it, hang 
                it. Damn these foreign adventurers say I.</p>   
            <p>I think I shall now pitch overboard fr my book the Hartmannian lading (supplement)
                entirely.</p>
            <p>I have a day off to-day: am resting by varnishing, shellac-ing &#38;c
                inside&#8212;polishing the nacre of the shell.</p>
            <p>Glad to hear that the Sarrazin book<ptr target="loc.03000_n3"/> is out. Will make note thereof.</p>
