            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>Vibrations of hot breath and cold breath come to us
                from the land of the Buckeyes—the positive election news from whence is looked for
                here, with great interest. If Ohio has newly chosen the whig<ptr target="med.00961_n4"/> ticket, as a dispatch
                in one of the morning papers intimates, it will make the contest close. The
                impression here, at present, is, however, that the democratic Governor is elected
                in Ohio. But you will know the result, by telegraph, before this reaches you....We
                are now, as you may imagine, in the true whirl of excitement. "Old Hunkers" and
                "Barnburners,"<ptr target="med.00950_n1"/> and Taylorites<ptr target="med.00989_n10b"/> of a 
                warmer or cooler complexion, "mingle, mingle,
                mingle," in crowds, public and private, and hold hot arguments in Wall street, and
                on the steamboats, and even amid the deafening roar of the omnibusses. Old Tammany
                has a monster flag, with that Grecian temple, and the names of the regular
                democratic nominees. Great fun, though, is poked by the wags, at the petty larceny
                conduct of the female figure who appears to be either running away or hiding behind
                the centre post of the aforesaid temple. Last night, the great flag fell down, and
                trailed in the dust of Nassau street.</p> 
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The Government continues ousting the Van Buren<ptr target="med.00989_n11"/>
                men from the Customhouse, and its appertainments. Several were discharged yesterday
                and the previous day....Have you, amid the "Free Soil"<ptr target="med.00954_n6"/> excitement, noticed what wide
                and steady progress has been made by the doctrines of what are called the "National
                Reformers"? (that ambiguous and unmeaning name, which they ought to change for
                something more descriptive and distinctive.) Depend upon it, these people are
                already fitted by numbers and power, to exercise a potent influence on the elections
                of this country. Well, there is much good in some of their nations<ptr target="med.00981_n1"/>—particularly that
                demanding public land, in moderate quantities, for all actual settlers....We shall
                soon have a complete line of telegraph from this city to Halifax, N.S., via Boston
                and <gap reason="illegible, folded"/> A good plan has been adopted by that extortortionate 
                <gap reason="illegible, folded"/> between this
                city and Philadelphia. For some time past, they have sent an early train—at 6
                o'clock a.m.—fare three dollars; so that a person can go and stay several hours in
                Philadelphia, and then return at night....Our railroad, hence to Albany, is, about
                one-fourth of it, completely graded and ready for the superstructure of rails, etc.
                It looks somewhat ticklish, running close along the river, and often touching it,
                with the great mountains and rocks penning it in to the east....Lots of the innocent
                ones, in town, are victimized by sharpers, about now. Even the stale tricks of
                pocket-book dropping, watch stuffing, and so on, go down yet. Omnibus thieving, too,
                is rife....The crowd at the Castle Garden Fair is so great, that sometimes, of an
                evening, people can't get in. Where does all the money go?....Dr. Morrill,<ptr target="med.00980_n4"/> the
                balloon man, who started last Wednesday afternoon from Broadway, on an upward trip,
                came down ku-slosh in the waters of the Atlantic ocean, half a dozen miles from the
                light ship, somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock at night. After ducking and bobbing up
                and around, for some time, the high-flyer was taken off by a pilot boat, but for
                whose presence near by, the Doctor would certainly have gone to kingdom come. He
                saved not only himself, but his baloon, and come into town Friday morning....There
                is a great war going on here among the hatters—who get some hard 
                <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi>. Never was the
                Scottish man more popular in his land, than K. is in this. But O, what a fashion the
                brimless things of Broadway present this fall!</p>
