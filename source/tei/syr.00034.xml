                <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours of 27 January,<ptr target="syr.00034_n1"/> and Leaves of Grass, received.
                Please accept my sincere thanks for your kindness in sending me the book and for the
                gratification you have given me by writing in it as I requested. I beg to enclose
                P.O. order in your favor for One Pound&#8212;No. 2044.</p> 
            <p>I hope that you did not consider my request for your photograph impertinent. My only
                intimation that you had had one recently taken was the published letter to you from
                    Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> and therefore my allusion to it. It was a very
                deep disappointment to me that I failed so signally in my endeavor to prove to you
                how many in Ireland would gladly avail themselves of an opportunity to show their
                gratitude for such a gift as Leaves of Grass. But the reason is readily given. The
                chief men in connection with the University had contributed through Mr. H.H.
                Gilchrist,<ptr target="n0262"/> and such men as the Lord Chancellor<ptr target="syr.00034_n3"/> and Sir E.C. Guinness<ptr target="syr.00034_n2"/> resemble 
                Gallio<ptr target="syr.00034_n4"/> 
                in that they care for none of these things. Professor Edward
                    Dowden<ptr target="n0199"/> I have the honor of knowing for the past eighteen
                months&#8212;indeed, it is to my love of Leaves of Grass that I am indebted for my
                acquaintance with so lovable a man&#8212;and he is aware that I did my
                best&#8212;however&#8212;perhaps I soared too high&#8212;in addressing Barbarians. I
                had told Dowden of my not having received any reply to my cards or letters and my
                apprehension that you might be ill, and I have therefore all the greater pleasure in
                conveying (to him at least) your "best regards."</p>
            <p>The two volumes I mentioned as having been sold by me were purchased by the National
                Library for one pound.</p> 
            <closer>
                <salute> With every sincere wish that you may enjoy <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, which is happiness, I am,
                    dear sir, yours very gratefully,</salute>
                <signed>Richard Colles</signed>
