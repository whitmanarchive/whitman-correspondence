        <salute>Dear Benton Wilson,</salute><ptr target="loc.01563_n2"/>
        <salute>Dear loving comrade,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>As I have just been again reading your last letter to me of December 19, last, I think I
        wrote to you on receiving it, but cannot now remember for certain. Sometimes, after an
        interval, the thought of one I much love comes upon me strong &amp; full all of a
        sudden—&amp; now as I sit here by a big open window, this beautiful afternoon, every
        thing quiet &amp; sunny—I have been, &amp; am now, thinking so of you, dear young
          man,<ptr target="loc.01563_n3"/> &amp; of your love, or more rightly speaking, our love
        for each other—so curious, so sweet, I say so <hi rend="italic">religious</hi>—</p>

      <p>We met there in the Hospital<ptr target="loc.01563_n4"/>—how little we have been
        together—seems to me we ought to be some together every day of our lives—I don't
        care about talking, or amusement—but just to be together, &amp; work together, or go
        off in the open air together—Now it is a long while since we have been
        together—&amp; it seems a long while since I have had a letter. Don't blame me for not
        writing oftener. </p>

      <p>I know you would feel satisfied if you could only realize how &amp; how much I am thinking
        of you, &amp; with what great love,<ptr target="loc.01563_n5"/> this afternoon. I can hardly
        express it in a letter<ptr target="loc.01563_n6"/>—but I thought I would just write a
        letter this time off-hand to you, dearest soldier, only for love to you—I thought it
        might please you. </p>

      <p>Nothing very new or different in my affairs. I am still working here in Atty Gens
        office—same <choice>
          <orig>posish</orig>
          <reg>position</reg>
        </choice>—have good health—expect to bring out new editions of my books before
        very long—how is the little boy—I send my love to him, &amp; to your wife &amp;
          parents.<ptr target="loc.01563_n7"/>
