                <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge receipt by last mail of the copy of
                        Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> Address<ptr target="loc.02462_n2"/> which
                    you so kindly sent &amp; to thank you very cordially for it.</p>
                <p>I have read it through with intense interest and pleasure &amp; I regard it as a
                    valuable contribution to "Whitman Literature"—from Ingersollism the best
                    that has yet been given—significant both from what he has said &amp; left
                    unsaid for he has left untouched <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02462.004.jpg" type="verso"/> what I regard as the main &amp; vital element in <hi rend="underline">L of G</hi> vis the spirituality which permeates &amp;
                    animates every page, every line &amp; is the inspiring element in your teaching.
                    But as we could not expect <hi rend="underline">him</hi> to recognise this we
                    must be thankful for what we have got, as, apart from this, the address is
                    really a wonderful bit of work &amp; will, I think, rank as one of his most
                    brilliant oratorical achievements. I shall prize the pamphlet very highly for
                    its own sake, but more so because <hi rend="underline">you</hi> have sent it to
                    me &amp; I again thank you for your great kindness in doing so. <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02462.005.jpg" type="recto"/> It is the
                    intention of "the boys"<ptr target="loc.07991_n2b"/> to have the whole of it read aloud
                    at the next meeting of the "College" (Feb 9<hi rend="underline">th</hi>).</p>
                <p>During the last week I have been a little uneasy about you, wondering at times
                    how you were, &amp; I accepted the pamphlet as a message that all was well with
                    you. But today I have been grieved to read the following par: in the London <hi rend="underline">Daily Graphic</hi>:—</p>
                <p>A post card<ptr target="n5005"/> received from Walt Whitman says "Am having an extra bad spell these
                    days. May blow over may not"</p>
                <p>This is indeed bad news for me &amp; for all your friends <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02462.006.jpg" type="verso"/> here &amp; I sincerely hope that by
                    this time the "extra bad spell" is blowing over &amp; that you are through the
                    worst of it. We shall be most anxious until we receive some more definite news
                    &amp; I have asked Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> to send me word in case you
                    are unable to do so.</p> 
                <p>There has been a great change in the weather here—all the frost &amp; snow
                    have gone &amp; we have lately had a continuous spell of "open" weather.</p>

                                <handShift rend="printed"/>—Lord Tennyson is said to be
                                    contemplating a voyage in the Mediterranean, if he can find a
                                    vessel in which he can be protected from his fellow-passengers.
                                    The dread of being mobbed is said to interfere even with the
                                    Poet Laureate's country walks, and a good story is told of his
                                    surprise on one occasion when a fellow-creature passed him
                                    without taking any notice of him whatever. "The fellow seems not
                                    to know who I am!" is said to have been his exclamation.</p>
