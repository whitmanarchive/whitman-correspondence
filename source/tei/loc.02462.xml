                <p>Just a few lines to acknowledge receipt by last mail of the copy of
                        Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> Address<ptr target="loc.02462_n2"/> which
                    you so kindly sent &#38; to thank you very cordially for it.</p>

                <p>I have read it through with intense interest and pleasure &#38; I regard it as a
                    valuable contribution to "Whitman Literature"&#8212;from Ingersollism the best
                    that has yet been given&#8212;significant both from what he has said &#38; left
                    unsaid for he has left untouched</p>

                <p>what I regard as the main &#38; vital element in <hi rend="underline">L of G</hi>
                    vis the spirituality which permeates &#38; animates every page, every line &#38;
                    is the inspiring element in your teaching. But as we could not expect <hi
                        rend="underline">him</hi> to recognise this we must be thankful for what we
                    have got, as, apart from this, the address is really a wonderful bit of work
                    &#38; will, I think, rank as one of his most brilliant oratorical achievements.
                    I shall prize the pamphlet very highly for its own sake, but more so because <hi
                        rend="underline">you</hi> have sent it to me &#38; I again thank you for
                    your great kindness in doing so.</p>

                <p>It is the intention of "the boys" to have the whole of it read aloud at the next
                    meeting of the "College" (Feb 9th).</p>

                <p>During the last week I have been a little uneasy about you, &#38; wondering at
                    times how you were, &#38; I accepted the pamphlet as a message that all was well
                    with you. But today I have been grieved to read the following par:[agraph] in
                    the London <hi rend="underline">Daily Graphic</hi>:&#8212;</p>

                <p>A post card received from Walt Whitman says "Am having an extra bad spell these
                    days. May blow over may not"</p>

                <p>This is indeed bad news for me &#38; for all your friends</p>

                <p>here &#38; I sincerely hope that by this time the "extra bad spell" is blowing
                    over &#38; that you are through the worst of it. We shall be most anxious until
                    we receive some more definite news &#38; I have asked Warry<ptr
                        target="loc.00668_n4"/> to send me word in case you are unable to do so.</p>

                    have gone &#38; we have lately had a continuous spell of "open" weather.</p>

                <p>With kindest regards to all the members of your household &#38; with best love to
                    yourself</p>

                                    contemplating a voyage in the Mediterranean, if he can find a
                                    vessel in which he can be protected from his fellow-passengers.
                                    The dread of being mobbed is said to interfere even with the
                                    Poet Laureate's country walks, and a good story is told of his
                                    surprise on one occasion when a fellow-creature passed him
                                    without taking any notice of him whatever. "The fellow seems not
                                    to know who I am!" is said to have been his exclamation. London
