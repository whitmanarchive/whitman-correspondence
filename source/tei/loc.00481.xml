               <salute>My dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I received your letter<ptr target="loc.00481_n1"/> the other day&#8212;also the papers with the enclosures&#8212;and glad I was to hear from you again  Probably as Jess has told you I am poking around from place to place spending about 1/3 of my time on Rail Road trains<ptr target="loc.00481_n2"/>&#8212;and although it is not as bad as it might be yet I cannot say that I enjoy it much&#8212;suppose I would if I was fifteen years younger&#8212;but it is as it is<ptr target="loc.00481_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>We are having a bad snow storm here to-day&#8212;and I hav'nt been out yet&#8212;but I think I will walk over and look at the lake which I suppose is kicking up considerable of a bobbery just about now  The Milwaukee bay is a first rate place to see the waves dash on the shore it being about this shape<figure facs="loc.00481.001.jpg">
                  <head type="main-authorial"/>
                  <figDesc>Jeff Whitman's sketch of the shape of the Milwaukee Bay. Reproduced here from a scan of a photocopy of the original.</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <ptr target="loc.00481_n4"/> and when the wind is blowing stiff from the East you can see a wave start in at <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and follow it for two or three miles as it passes B&#8212;that is except at the points at the mouth of the river or where the projecting piers are. When a fellow feels good it is lots of fun to see them&#8212;but just to day I dont feel first class  Kinder lonely&#8212;been in too much I suppose&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am up here engaged in the almost hopeless task of trying to determine what can be done with the sewage of the town. Just now it is all emptied into the river that flows through the city and the deposit has become so great that in the summer it is terribly offensive to those who live along the edge of the river</p>
            <p>I shall be here, off and on probably, five or six months&#8212;that is if the infernal thing dont worry me to death</p>
            <p>I judge from your letter that you are holding your own fairly well&#8212;of course we are all getting older and as you say the machine will show wear, never so well may we patch it up. But I feel very much like our old friend Ruggles<ptr target="loc.00481_n5"/> used to say, "we must make the best of it"</p>
            <p>I hope, dear Walt, that you will keep in good spirits during the bad weather&#8212;I find in my own case that it is the hardest thing I have to combat&#8212;I often think that the only fellow that knows how to live is the wild-goose  He makes the world his own and follows the climate he likes&#8212;and no question of business can keep him either  Well good by Walt&#8212;write me whenever you feel like it  I always want to know how you are</p>
