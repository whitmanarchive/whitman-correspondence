            <salute>My dear Walt</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I received your letter<ptr target="loc.00481_n1"/> the other day&#8212;also the papers
            with enclosures&#8212;and glad I was to hear from you again  Probably as Jess has told
            you I am poking around from place to place spending about 1/3 of my time on Rail Road
               trains<ptr target="loc.00481_n2"/>&#8212;and although it is not as bad as it might be
            yet I cannot say that I enjoy it much&#8212;suppose I would if I was fifteen years
            younger&#8212;but it is as it is<ptr target="loc.00481_n3"/></p>
         <p>We are having a bad snow storm here to-day&#8212;and I <choice>
               <sic>hav'nt</sic>
               <corr>haven't</corr>
            </choice> been out yet&#8212;but I think I will walk over and look at <pb
               xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_ad.00540_large.jpg" type="verso"/> the lake which I
            suppose is kicking up considerable of a bobbery just about now  The Milwaukee bay is a
            first rate place to see the waves dash on the shore it being about this shape<ptr
               target="loc.00481_n4"/><figure facs="loc.00481.001.jpg">
               <head type="main-authorial"/>
               <figDesc>Jeff Whitman's sketch of the shape of the Milwaukee Bay. Reproduced here
                  from a scan of a photocopy of the original.</figDesc>
            </figure> and when the wind is blowing stiff from the East you can see a wave start in
            at <hi rend="underline">A</hi> and follow it for two or three miles as it passes
            B&#8212;that is except at the points at the mouth of the river or where the projecting
            piers are. When a fellow feels good it is lots of fun to see them&#8212;but just to day
            I <choice>
               <sic>dont</sic>
               <corr>don't</corr>
            </choice> feel first class  Kinder lonely&#8212;been in too much I suppose&#8212;</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_ad.00541_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
         <p>I am up here engaged in the almost hopeless task of trying to determine what can be done
            with the sewage of the town. Just now it is all emptied into the river that flows
            through the city and the deposit has become so great that in the summer it is terribly
            offensive to those who live along the edge of the river</p>
         <p>I shall be here, off and on probably, five or six months&#8212;that is if the infernal
            thing <choice>
               <sic>dont</sic>
               <corr>don't</corr>
            </choice> worry me to death</p>
         <p>I judge from your letter that you are holding your own fairly well&#8212;of course we
            are all getting older <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_ad.00542_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            and as you say the machine will show wear, never so well may we patch it up. But I feel
            very much like our old friend Ruggles<ptr target="loc.00481_n5"/> used to say, "we must
            make the best of it"</p>
         <p>I hope, dear Walt, that you will keep in good spirits during the bad weather&#8212;I
            find in my own case that it is the hardest thing I have to combat&#8212;I often think
            that the only fellow that knows how to live is the wild-goose  He makes the world his
            own and follows the climate he likes&#8212;and no question of business can keep him
            either  Well good by Walt&#8212;write me whenever you feel like it  I always want to
            know how you are</p>
