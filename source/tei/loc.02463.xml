            <p>I was indeed delighted to receive your kind p.c. of the 
                8th<ptr target="loc.02463_n1"/> inst which, together with that<ptr target="loc.02463_n2"/> to J.W.W<ptr
                    target="n6121"/> &#38; the cablegram from H.L.T.<ptr target="n4267"/> greatly
                relieved our anxiety regarding you. I am very glad to learn that at the time of
                writing you seemed to be getting over your bad time&#8212;"a bad two months" &#38; I
                fondly hope that by this time the attack has passed off &#38; left you in
                comparative comfort</p>
            <p>Sorry to hear of Dr B's<ptr target="n0119"/> illness. Hope that he has now quite
                recovered from it</p>
            <p>Things are going on <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02463.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                with us here much as usual&#8212;my time being chiefly occupied with my professional
                work, with, as you will see from the <hi rend="underline">Bolton Journal</hi> which
                I send you, an occasional social diversion.</p>
            <p>During the last three weeks my wife has been on the sick
                list&#8212;suffering from a rather severe attack of spasmodic bronchial catarrh
                &#38; neuralgia, which I am glad to say seem to be slowly subsiding now.</p>
            <p>I presume you have recd the Feb No. of the <hi rend="underline">Review of
                Reviews</hi><ptr target="loc.05015_n3"/> containing a facsimile of one of your p.c's &#38; a portrait.<ptr target="loc.04337_n2"/> I am
                sorry the latter is such an unsatisfactory one <hi rend="underline">&#38; I don't
                    like that "foxy" portrait</hi> to go before the English people as <hi
                    rend="underline">your</hi> counterfeit presentiment, but <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02463.003.jpg" type="recto"/> it
                seems to be the only one that the London folks have of you. I thought of sending the editor of the <hi
                    rend="underline">Rev of Rev</hi> (Mr Stead)<ptr target="n4113"/> a copy of the
                one you sent to J.W.W but he &#38; I think it best not to do so until after the
                publication of yr "2nd Annex"<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/> of which it will be one of the attractions.</p>
            <p>I have secured the copyright of that portrait in this country so that it cannot be
                reproduced without my permission.</p>
            <p>Should you <hi rend="underline">wish</hi> me to send a copy (?Notes as well) I will
                do so but not without your express desire or should you send him one perhaps you
                would kindly mention the fact of its <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#aa"

            <p>At the next exhibition of my American photographic slides&#8212;which will be on Mar
