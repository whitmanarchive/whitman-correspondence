            <p>I rec'd your letter of last Thursday—I suppose you got one from me the Saturday before, with some envelopes in, &amp; $1—Well, mother, you have got a letter from that good for nothing pup again<ptr target="nyp.00208_n1"/>—it is too bad to be worried so—but one is powerless to do any thing, under present circumstances—I hope George will do well, in the houses, if he &amp; the others put them up on Portland av.—I see there are cases of cholera once in a while in New York—you must all be careful of yourselves—it is very healthy here this summer—I havn't been troubled by the heat yet—my head is much better—</p>
            <p>Mother, I must tell you I am having some new shirts made—quite an event—I can't hardly believe it when I think how those old ones you fixed, &amp; fixed again, have held out—but, poor old things, they have got played out pretty well—why I believe I have got one or two that you fixed for me when I went to Boston there six years ago, &amp; more—I have 'em made in the same way as ever, &amp; I think they are going to be very good—I expect to have half a dozen—so you see I am coming out—had quite a clearing out the other day, collected all my old tattered duds &amp; socks, &amp; boots &amp; slippers &amp;c &amp;c. into a great heap—and when Sally, our black girl, brought up my breakfast, I told her she could have 'em all, if she wanted 'em—she was most tickled to death—took 'em all off home—there was nothing but what was all give out, though—</p>
            <p>There is nothing new with me in my affairs—if things would only work so that I could get a higher grade, with more pay, it would come very acceptable—but here I remain, in the same way as at first—however I am very glad to have what I have—Tell Jeff<ptr target="nyp.00208_n2"/> I should like to see him very much—I think he would find it pleasant to come here for a few days, even this season—Well, dear mother, my sheet is full—love to all—</p>
