                <salute>My dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yesterday your post-card<ptr target="n5002c"/> &amp; your very welcome books reached me. I spent a good part
                of the day over Two Rivulets,<ptr target="loc.02250_n7"/> the Preface, &amp; the Memoranda of the War,<ptr target="uva.00381_n7"/>
                &amp; was not far from you, I think, in feeling, however separated in place. I seem to see some gains from the 
                illness which has grieved us. Tones &amp; tints have passed from it into your writings which add to their 
                comprehensiveness &amp; their truth &amp; tenderness. At the same time I hold to <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi>
                &amp; accept it,&#8212;taking it as a whole,&#8212;with entire satisfaction. It seems to me more for the soul, &amp; 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01497.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                for things beyond physiology than you, contrasting it with your projected songs more specially for the soul, 
                quite recognize. The non-moral parts of it, such parts as simply are the "tally" of nature are taken 
                up into other portions of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> &amp; are spiritualized; &amp; each part belongs 
                to the other. In <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> I find a complete man, not body alone, or chiefly, but body 
                &amp; soul. That its <hi rend="underline">direct</hi> tendency (&amp; not alone its indirect) is to invigorate 
                &amp; reinforce the soul I feel assured. But in contrast to the pride &amp; buoyancy, &amp; resonant tones of 
                <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> the tenderer, more penetrating, more mystic &amp; withdrawn tones of 
                <hi rend="underline">Passage to India</hi>,<ptr target="n0465"/> &amp; of the recent poems &amp; prose seem to 
                me to be a gain, as serving the same, &amp; not other, purposes but for other <hi rend="underline">moments</hi>, 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01497.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                other moods &amp; natures,&#8212;&amp; I think many of your future readers may gain an entrance to your earlier 
                writings through your later &amp; that for some persons this will be the fittest way&#8212;</p>
            <p>At present I have little doubt you ought not to <hi rend="underline">set yourself</hi> to any brain-work, 
                but at the same time you ought not to think of ceasing to write, for every now &amp; again the mood will come, 
                &amp; you will write something as admirable as anything you have written heretofore. Your friends here want to 
                think of you as free from all pressure to write, &amp; anxieties about material well-being, with your spirit 
                open to all pleasant &amp; good influences the Earth, &amp; the Season, &amp; your own thoughts bring to you. 
                The Newspaper paragraph you sent Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> &amp; me has made us 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01497.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                fear it may not be so with you, &amp; we remain in suspense as to whether we might not make some move which would 
                relieve us from some of this dissatisfied feeling on your behalf. Ought it not to be a duty, too, of&#8212;not the 
                American public to recognize your gift to America as a writer but&#8212;the American Government to recognize your 
                services, as of one who saved the lives, &amp; lightened the sufferings of many American citizens&#8212;It would be 
                honourable to the Government &amp; to you. I write knowing little of the actual probability of this, but I believe 
                in England we would be careful of such a voluntary public servant.</p>
            <p>We are all well, my wife &amp; children &amp; <hi rend="underline">I</hi>.<ptr target="loc.01497_n3"/></p>
