                <salute>My dear Mr
                    Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yesterday your post-card &amp; your very welcome books reached me. I spent a good
                part of the day over Two Rivulets, the Preface, &amp; the Memoranda of the War,
                &amp; was not far from you, I think, in feeling, however separated in place. I seem
                to see some gains from the illness which has grieved us. Tones &amp; tints have
                passed from it into your writings which add to their comprehensiveness &amp; their
                truth &amp; tenderness. At the same time I hold to <hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                    </choice></hi> &amp; accept it,&#8212;taking it as a whole&#8212;with entire
                satisfaction. It seems to me more for the soul, &amp; <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01497.002.jpg" type="verso"/> for things beyond physiology than you,
                contrasting it with your projected songs more specially for the soul, quite
                recognize. The non-moral parts of it, such parts as simply are the "tally" of nature
                are taken up into other portions of <hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                    </choice></hi> &amp; are spiritualized &amp; each part belongs to the other. In
                    <hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                    </choice></hi> I find a complete man, not body alone, or <choice>
                    <sic>cheefly</sic>
                    <corr>chiefly</corr>
                </choice>, but body &amp; soul. That its <hi rend="underline">direct</hi> tendency
                (&amp; not alone its indirect) is to invigorate &amp; reinforce the soul I feel
                assured. But in contrast to the pride &amp; buoyancy, &amp; resonant tones of <hi rend="underline"><choice>
                        <abbr>L. of G.</abbr>
                        <expan>Leaves of Grass</expan>
                    </choice></hi> the tenderer, more penetrating, more mystic &amp; withdrawn tones
                of <hi rend="underline">Passage to India</hi><!-- <ptr target="n0465"/> -->, &amp; of the
                recent poems &amp; prose seem to me to be a gain, as serving the same, &amp; not
                other, purposes but for other <hi rend="underline">moments</hi>, <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01497.003.jpg" type="recto"/> other moods &amp;
                natures,&#8212;&amp; I think many of your future readers may gain an entrance to
                your earlier writings through your later &amp; that for some persons this will be
                the fittest way&#8212;</p>

            <p>At present I have little doubt you ought not to <hi rend="underline">set
                    yourself</hi> to any brain-work, but at the same time you ought not to think of
                ceasing to write, for every now &amp; again the mood will come, &amp; you will write
                something as admirable as anything you have written heretofore. Your friends here
                want to think of you as free from all pressure to write, &amp; anxieties about
                material well-being, with your spirit open to all pleasant &amp; good influences the
                Earth, &amp; the Season, &amp; your own thoughts bring to you. The Newspaper
                paragraph you sent Rossetti &amp; me has made us <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01497.004.jpg" type="verso"/> fear it may not be so with you, &amp; we
                remain in suspense as to whether we might not make some move which would relieve us
                from some of this dissatisfied feeling on your behalf. Ought it not to be a duty,
                too, of&#8212;not the American public to recognize your gift to America as a writer
                but&#8212;the American Government to recognize your services, as of one who saved
                the lives, &amp; lightened the sufferings of many American citizens&#8212;It would
                be honourable to the Government &amp; to you. I write knowing little of the actual
                probability of this, but I believe in England we would be careful of such a
                voluntary public servant.</p>

            <p>We are all well, my wife &amp; children &amp; <hi rend="underline">I</hi>.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Always affectionately yours</salute>
