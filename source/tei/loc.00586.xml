         <p>Perhaps you have forgotten a wild harum scarum <choice><sic>yound</sic><corr>young</corr></choice> man who used to linger around Thayer &amp; Eldridges Publishing office Boston in the spring of 1860  But he still remembers you and has been waiting very patiently for a volume of Leaves of Grass which was to be sent to Lawrence Kansas Perhaps you think I am writing rather familiar for almost a stranger and writing to a distinguished Poet but I think I have made a sufficient <choice><sic>appology</sic><corr>apology</corr></choice> when I tell you I have been in <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00314_large.jpg" type="verso"/>the Rocky Mountains for almost two years where every man is an old acquaintance if you never saw him before</p>
            <p>When I left Boston I came to Kansas and from there out here among Grizzly bears, Indians Yankees and almost every species of man and beast that inhabit the globe. I have lived on venison and I have lived on bread I have gone hungry for many a day and have had plenty to eat for many more, and for all the hardships I have seen it suits me, I like it  I enjoy myself hugely, and I think you would do the same</p>
            <p>I now hold the position of 1st Lieut of Co K 1st Reg <choice><abbr>Col</abbr><expan>Colorado</expan></choice> Vols<ptr target="loc.00586_n2"/> and suppose I shall be a soldier for the next few years</p>
         <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00315_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I have often heard Leaves of Grass highly spoken of away out here but have never seen a volume until a few days ago and the man who has that will not dispose of that for any price he brought it out with him to this country.</p>
            <p>I am in an old log shanty to night away up in the mountains about forty miles from the valley the wind blows a perfect <choice><orig>hurracane</orig><reg>hurricane</reg></choice> and it is cold as Greenland  I am writing by the light of a pitch pine fire, it is past twelve oclock and I must go to bed as I must start for the valley in the morning. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> want you to forget to answer this. Good night</p>
