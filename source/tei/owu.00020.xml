            <p>The sun shines out bright &amp; cheerful this morning—&amp; in my east window I
                have a fine healthy rose-bush—I see it has got two roses, in bloom, &amp; one
                just budding out—(it was a present from Mrs. Channing<ptr target="loc.01257_n1"/> of Providence—she sent on here, and had it got for

                myself—I have been in the habit of soaking my feet in hot water every night
                for two months now—&amp; I think lately it has done me more harm than
                good—one thing is, it has probably made me catch a slight cold—so I have <choice>

            <p>—I have just
                had my breakfast, &amp; am sitting here alone by the stove, writing
                this—Charles Eldridge<ptr target="loc.00944_n3"/> will be here in a few
                minutes, &amp; bring the morning papers—he comes &amp; sits a few minutes
                every morning before going to work—he has been very good indeed—he &amp;
                Peter Doyle<ptr target="n0752"/> hold out through every thing—most of the rest
                have got tired &amp; <choice>

            <p>I go over to the office about 12 or 1 most every day——but only for a few
                minutes—have not resumed work there yet, but hope to, Monday—I find
                there is a great deal of paralysis around, and they say I have got along very
                well—but it <choice>

                </choice> so slow, so aggravating, to be disabled, so feeble, cannot walk nor do any
                thing, when one's mind &amp; will are just as clear as ever—Still <hi rend="underline">I feel</hi> I shall get as well as usual yet dearest
                mother—&amp; then I shall <hi rend="underline">surely</hi> get here or buy or
                build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed<ptr target="n0699"/> and me<ptr target="owu.00020_n3"/>—I realize it more, far
                more now, than ever—even for my own comfort—this spring is better to buy
                here than usual—I think we could get along <hi rend="underline">very well</hi>
                indeed—you could visit George &amp; Lou<ptr target="n1046"/> as often as you
                liked (&amp; George &amp; Lou could come &amp; pay us a visit in winter when
                Congress is in full blast)—</p>
            <p>—I miss John<ptr target="n0129"/> &amp; Mrs. Burroughs<ptr target="n0892"/>—they are at a place called Waukill, N.Y. state—they have hired out
                their house furnished, 6 <choice><abbr>mo's</abbr><expan>months</expan></choice>, 
                $50 a month. I have not heard any thing further from Jeff<ptr target="owu.00020_n4"/>—</p>
            <p>—I hope to come on soon &amp; pay you all a visit,
                but wait to see how things go in the office—&amp; how I feel—(as I have
                been absent now nine weeks)—Every thing looks pleasant here to-day—quite
                spring like—Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good
                spirits, as that is the main thing.—Mother as I cannot get down to the p.o. I
                send the money once more enclosed—write me Sunday, if convenient—<choice><abbr>Chas.</abbr>
                    <expan>Charles</expan>
                </choice> Eldridge has been in—it is now later, towards 12—I have washed
                &amp; put on some clean clothes, &amp; am going over to the office—</p>
