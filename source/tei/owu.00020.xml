            </opener>

            <p>The sun shines out bright &amp; cheerful this morning&#8212;&amp; in my east window I have 
                a fine healthy rose-bush&#8212;I see it has got two roses in bloom, &amp; one just budding out&#8212;(it was a present from Mrs. Channing<ptr target="owu.00020_n2"/> of Providence&#8212;she sent on here, 
                and had it got for me, when I was first sick)&#8212;I think I am feeling better to-day, 
                &amp; more like myself&#8212;I have been in the habit of soaking my feet in hot water 
                every night for two months now&#8212;&amp; I think lately it has done me more harm than good&#8212;one thing is, it has probably made me catch a slight cold&#8212;so I have <choice><orig>stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice> it, 
                &amp; I have a notion I feel better from stopping it&#8212;&#8212;I have just had my breakfast, 
                &amp; am sitting here alone by the stove, writing this&#8212;Charles Eldridge will be here 
                in a few minutes, &amp; bring the morning papers&#8212;he comes &amp; sits a few minutes 
                every morning before going to work&#8212;he has been very good indeed&#8212;he &amp; Peter Doyle hold out through every thing&#8212;most of the rest have got tired 
                &amp; <choice><orig>stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice> coming&#8212;(which is just as well)&#8212;Mrs. O'Connor comes whenever she can, 
                &amp; generally brings a dish of roast apples, or something&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="owu.00020.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I go over to the office about 12 or 1 most every day&#8212;&#8212;but only for a few minutes&#8212;have not resumed work there yet, but hope to, Monday&#8212;I find there is a great deal 
                of paralysis around, and they say I have got along very well&#8212;but it <choice><sic/><corr>is</corr></choice> so slow, 
                so aggravating, to be disabled, so feeble, cannot walk nor do any thing, 
                when one's mind &amp; will are just as clear as ever&#8212;Still <hi rend="underline">I</hi> <hi rend="underline">feel</hi> I shall get 
                as well as usual yet, dearest mother&#8212;&amp; then I shall <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="underline">surely</hi></hi> get here or buy 
                or build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed and me<ptr target="owu.00020_n3"/>&#8212;I realize it more, far more now, than ever&#8212;even for my own comfort&#8212;this spring is better to buy here than usual&#8212;&#8212;I think we could get along <hi rend="underline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">well</hi> indeed&#8212;you could visit George &amp; Lou as often as you liked (&amp; George &amp; Lou could come 
                &amp; pay us a visit in winter when Congress is in full blast)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;I miss John &amp; Mrs. Burroughs&#8212;they are at a place called Waukill, N.Y. state&#8212;they have hired out their house furnished, 6 <choice><abbr>mo's</abbr><expan>months</expan></choice>, $50 a month. I have not heard 
                any thing further from Jeff<ptr target="owu.00020_n4"/>&#8212;I hope to come on soon &amp; pay you all a visit, 
                but wait to see how things go in the office&#8212;&amp; how I feel&#8212;(as I have been absent now nine weeks)&#8212;Every thing looks pleasant here to-day&#8212;quite spring like&#8212;Mother dear 
                I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good spirits, as that is the main thing. 
&#8212;Mother as I cannot get down to the p.o. I send the money once more enclosed&#8212;write me Sunday, if convenient&#8212;<choice><abbr>Chas.</abbr><expan>Charles</expan></choice> Eldridge has been in&#8212;it is now later, 
                towards 12&#8212;I have washed &amp; put on some clean clothes, &amp; am going over to the office&#8212;</p>
