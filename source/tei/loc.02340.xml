                    <reg>rememberance</reg>
                </choice> of you &#38; your deserts it is because during the past decade of years I
                have been myself among the breakers; and clouds, tempests, &#38; darkness have been
                about me; but now I once more see the sun.</p>
            <p>I beg your acceptance of the enclosed<ptr target="loc.02340_n5"/> &#38; though but trifling, it will nevertheless
                show what my feelings are &#38; what more I would like to do.</p>
            <p>You remember Wells<ptr target="loc.02340_n2"/>&#8212;of Fowler &#38; Wells Phrenologists.<ptr target="loc.02340_n3"/> Through him &#38; other
                of your friends, in Bolton,<ptr target="loc.02340_n4"/> (though never having had the
                pleasure to meet you, personally) I have always felt that I knew you. Your good
                deeds to our country were during the war &#38; under circumstances more trying and
                perilous than mine; which were before; &#38; because of which, war came; for had
                Kansas been made a Slave State, there would never have been war: the Country would
                have become all Slave!&#8212;I was in the struggle to prevent Kansas being made a
                Slave State &#38; my name must have been known to you in those days &#38;
                familiar.</p>
