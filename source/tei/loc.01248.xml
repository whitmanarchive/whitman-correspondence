                <salute>Dear Walt</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Just a few lines of greeting and rememberance. Was glad to get y<hi rend="underline"
                >r</hi> card a few weeks ago.<ptr target="loc.01248_n3"/> This is one of those warm spring like days wh. we
                not unfrequently have in winter time when the buds &#38; the birds seem almost ready
                to make a start again&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am in London for a week or two, partly to arrange about a third &#38; enlarged
                edition of <hi rend="underline">Toward Democracy,</hi><ptr target="loc.01248_n2"/>
                wh. I expect to get <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01248.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> out by next March. That will about finish the book, and there
                will not be much added to it I believe afterwards.</p>
            <p>I had some good talks with Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> when he was over, and he told
                me a bit about you, and about his book<ptr target="loc.08152_n2"/> wh. he is
                bringing out. I guess, dear Walt, you have a tedious time of it on the
                whole&#8212;all those infirmities nagging don't leave the mind free for long. I got
                your Goodbye book<ptr target="loc.07894_n2"/>&#8212;and like the poem from wh. it
                takes its name about the best of any in <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.01248.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> it. "Goodbye&#8212;and hail!"
                After all the mind, the special local conciousness, is only a smallish part of
                oneself. It with all its troubles &#38; pains one may decently fold up in due time
                and put away in its appointed locker!</p>
            <p>I am glad you have such good friends with you&#8212;Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/>
                and Warry.<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> Kind greetings also to them. I am still
                living at Millthorpe (near Sheffield) and having good times, with many dear friends.
                We all read yr. Leaves of Grass<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01248.006_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>&#8212;or most of us&#8212;and it keeps just the same as ever or
                improves, like good wine.</p>
            <p>Give my love to Harry Stafford<ptr target="n0590"/> if you ever write or see him. I
                don't hear from Herbert Gilchrist<ptr target="n6151"/>&#8212;tho' I sometimes get
                tidings of him. Should like to come over to U.S.A, but no prospect at present. With
                much love to you as ever</p>
