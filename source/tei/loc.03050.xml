                that I am taking a vacation of six weeks to write the bk I told you of, I must bore
                you with a letter&#8212;just to say how'd'e, &amp; to tell you that my staunch little

                    in here by mistake!) (in abt' two 2 weeks) if agreeable. She is of the cheery-shy kind,
                &amp; will do you good. But if it shd so happen that you sh<hi rend="underline">d</hi>
                not feel like seeing anybody on the day she comes, she wants me to say that she will

            <p>I feel that I have broadened &amp; deepened my knowledge of human nature amazingly by the
                past two years of shoulder to shoulder work with the (to me) entirely hitherto unfamiliar class of skilled city mechanics
                (&amp; proof-readers). I feel much stronger in digestion &amp; in sinew, &amp; in character;
                self-reliant: nothing like it: to be able to snap yr fingers at cant, compromise,
                the sneaks of the profession, &amp;c.</p>
