                <p> Dear Sir&#8212;Though I made a fruitless attempt, some two years since to
                    communicate with you about a work to be published, relating to the <hi rend="underline">Whitman</hi>
                    <choice><orig>Geneology</orig><reg>Genealogy</reg></choice>, in which I thought you might take an interest, as perhaps of the same
                    family &#38; like to add what you might know of your names,&#8212;I am about to
                    make another effort &#38; enclose you what has just been furnished me by Mr Farnam,<ptr target="loc.04856_n2"/> who I
                    know would be glad to hear from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, for <hi
                        rend="underline">you</hi>, as many others of the name, are not unknown to
                    fame.<ptr target="loc.04856_n1"/></p>

                <p>
                        <handShift rend="printed"/>The great majority of those bearing the name of Whitman in the United
                        States are descended from John Whitman, who settled in Weymouth, Mass.,
                        about 1640, and from his sons Thomas, John, Abiah and Zechariah. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <handShift rend="printed"/>The record of the family to the fourth generation was prepared by Hon.
                        Judge Whitman, late of Portland, and for many years Chief Justice of Maine.
                        It is the endeavor of the writer of this circular to trace out from that
                        time the various branches, and thus continue the record to date. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <handShift rend="printed"/>If the work is to be well done, it is important that copies of old Bible
                        records, Tombstone inscriptions, family traditions and other matters of
                        interest should be collected and placed in proper hands for preservation and
                        comparison. I therefore particularly request all sons and daughters of all the Whitmans
                        to transmit to me such particulars of their own families, and of their ancestors' families, for two, 
                        three or four generations back, as they can find or obtain, stating, if possible places of
                        residence, occupation, etc., and especially copies of records of births,
                        marriages and deaths. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <handShift rend="printed"/>It will be thus possible to refer any correspondents to their ancient
                        stock and name their ancestors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <handShift rend="printed"/>I trust that all will have sufficient interest in the work to spare at
                        least the time to prepare their own record, and will give the matter their
                        immediate attention.
