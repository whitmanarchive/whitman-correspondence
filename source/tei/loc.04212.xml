            </opener>

            <p>You could not easily realize the strong emotion with which I read your last note and traced on the little map<ptr target="loc.31103_n1"/>—a most precious possession which I would not part with for the whole world—all your journeyings—both in youth &amp; now. Mingled emotions! for I cannot but feel anxious about your health, &amp; if I didn't know it was very naught to ask you questions, should beg you [to] tell me in what way your health has failed—whether it is the rheumatic &amp; neuralgic affection that troubled you the last spring we were in Philadelphia, or whether the fatigues &amp; excitements &amp; the very enjoyments &amp; full life, &amp; burst of prophetic joy, as it were, had proved too great a strain. But you have accomplished another thing, that had to be done in your life &amp; I exult with you—have seen the vast magnificent theatre, the free, unfettered conditions whereon humanity will enact a new drama, with the parts all so differently cast! the rest—the moving spirit of it all—hints of this, at least—flashes, glimpses, I find in your greatest poems. But, dear Friend, I think humanity moves forward [slowly] even under splendid conditions—you must give it a century or two instead of 50 years—before at least the crowning glories of a corresponding literature &amp; art will develope themselves—Nature has got plenty of time before her, &amp; obstinately refuses to be hurried; witness her dealings with the mere rocks &amp; stones.</p>
            
            <p>Bee<ptr target="n0260"/> is at Berne, working away merrily, rejoicing in the really splendid advantage for medical study there open to her. She mastered German so as to be able to speak &amp; understand it—lectures &amp; all—with ease during the two months at Wiesbaden &amp; she has found a thoroughly comfortable home with some excellent, intelligent ladies who are fond of her &amp; see to her bodily welfare in every possible way. I have my dear little grandson with me here—as engaging a little toddler as the sun ever shone upon—so affectionate &amp; sweet-tempered &amp; bright. I wish I could see him sitting on your knee. You will certainly have to come to us as soon as ever we have a comfortable home, won't you? Giddy<ptr target="n0890"/> is well &amp; as rosy as ever. She &amp; Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> send their love. I have seen Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/>—he was full of enquiries &amp; affectionate interest in all that concerns you—&amp; loth we were to break off our conversation &amp; hurry back—but Hampstead, the pleasantest &amp; prettiest of all our suburbs, is terribly inaccessible &amp; cuts us off a good deal from the intercourse with old friends I had looked forward to. It is on the top of a high hill (as high as the top of St. Pauls), &amp; looks down on one side over the great city with its canopy of smoke, &amp; on the other over a wide, pleasant stretch of green &amp; fertile Middlesex—has moreover pleasant lanes, solid old houses, shaded by big elms, &amp; other picturesque features &amp; such an abundance of keen, fresh air this cold weather too! We sigh for the warmth of an American house indoors often &amp; for American sunshine out of doors. Rossetti has a beautiful little group of children growing up around him—I think the eldest girl will grow up a real beauty &amp; the boy too is a noble little fellow. I meet numbers so delighted to hear about you. I believe Addington Symonds<ptr target="n0615"/> is preparing a book which treats largely of your Poems.</p>
           
            <p>Glad to hear that Brother &amp; Sister &amp; nieces are all well. I wish I could write to some of them, but what with needlework, an avalanche of letters, the care of my dear little man—the re-editing of my husband's life of Blake,<ptr target="loc.04045_n2"/> to which there will be a considerable addition of letters newly come to light, I hardly know which way to turn. Per.<ptr target="n2000"/> &amp; my nephew &amp; the "Process" have made a great stride forward. Won two important law suits at Berlin, where the Bessemer ring &amp; Krupp at their head were trying to oust them of their patent rights. Also it is practically making good way in England. So by &amp; bye the money will begin to flow in, I suppose—but has not done so yet.</p>
            
            <p>I trust, dearest Friend, this will find you safe &amp; fairly well again at Camden, with plenty of great, happy thoughts to brood over for the winter.</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>Love from us all. Good-bye.</salute>
