            <p>I wrote the date as above on 20<hi rend="underline">th</hi> and have not had a moment since in which to write
                the letter</p>
            <p>It is now <hi rend="underline">22 Aug.</hi></p>
            <p>And in the first place I may say that I received by mail from England nearly a week
                ago J.A. Symonds'<ptr target="n0615"/> "Essays: Speculative &#38; Suggestive," that I have, of course, found time to read "Democratic
                Art," and that I am greatly disappointed.<ptr target="loc.07357_n8"/>
                It, to my mind, comes far short of what
                such a man ought to have written on such a subject.<ptr target="loc.07357_n1"/> The singular thing to me is that
                he does not seem to understand the least what you are driving at, what you are <hi
                    rend="underline">there for</hi>. He speaks for instance of "Walt Whitman whose
                whole life has been
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00775.jpg" type="verso"/>
            employed in attempting to lay foundations for a new national literature."</p>
            <p>Is it not extraordinary that he should not see through and behind this (perfectly
                true as far as it goes) phase of the matter?</p>
            <p>How strange too (to cite a small but significant point) that he does not know that
                the "Poetry of the Future" is included in "Sp. Days &#38; Collect"?<ptr
                    target="loc.07357_n2"/></p> 
            <p>The whole article is "flat, stale and unprofitable"&#8212;a saw dust chewing
                business&#8211;dealing with the hull, the shell, the superfices, never for one time,
                one flash of insight penetrating to the heart of the business. Too bad, too bad.</p>
            <p>I have your note of 18<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr target="loc.07357_n3"/> Have not seen the
                    "Rejoinder"<ptr target="loc.07357_n4"/> you mention. Will you not send it? Or do
                you mean the reply to the Woodberry shirt sleeve lie?<ptr target="loc.07357_n5"/> I
                have that &#38; Kennedy's<ptr target="n3039"/> letter.<ptr target="loc.07357_n6"/> I hope you will find
                Symonds' letter &#38; send it,<ptr target="loc.07357_n7"/> am particularly anxious
                to read it now and compare it with his "Democratic Art" (it <hi rend="underline">may
                    be</hi> he has purposely kept to the outside, the form in "D. A." All well here and
