            <p>I arrived here yesterday &amp; this morning your dear good letter of Sept 10<hi rend="underline">th</hi>&amp;
                11<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02520_n2"/> reached me along with welcome letters from Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/>
                &amp; Horace Traubel.<ptr target="n4267"/></p>
            <p>I cannot tell you what a joy it is to me to receive a letter from you while I am
                staying in my dear Father's<ptr target="loc.02519_n5b"/> house &amp; I thank you most heartily for your kindness in sending
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02520.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                it. I am indeed glad to know that you were not losing much ground&#8212;that you were
                "feeling much the same"&#8212;for which small mercy tho' it is I am very
                thankful</p>
            <p>Glad also that you like the photos I sent &amp; that the underclothing was "just what
                you wanted." I will convey your thanks to Samuel Hodgkinson.<ptr target="loc.04829_n1b"/></p>
            <p>Thanks to you too for your loving salutation &amp; benediction to us all.</p>
            <p>I spent three delightful days at Blackpool, which I left on Sept 21<hi rend="underline">st</hi> for Corby 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02520.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                or Cumberland, on the bank of the beautiful Eden, where my dear sister<ptr target="loc.02519_n6"/> &amp; her husband<ptr target="n5001"/> live
                with their charming little boy<ptr target="n5001"/> of whom I am very fond, for he is a dear little chap.</p>
            <p>I am writing this sitting in the room in which I was born (still called "John's room") 
                overlooking the little garden where from the apple &amp; plum trees hang great bunches of
                ripening fruit. A robin is trilling his matins &amp; a red rose&#8212;almost the
                last rose of summer&#8212;is peeping in at the window. My dear good old father is in
                the garden, which is his peculiar care, my brother (a lawyer)<ptr target="loc.04820_n3"/> is reading 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02520.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                his morning letters &amp; my dear old mother<ptr target="loc.02519_n5"/> is busy with domestic duties.</p>
            <p>Looking far out I can see the top of old Criffel&#8212;a hill often mentioned by
                Carlyle;<ptr target="n4301"/> for you will remember that Carlyle received his early education at Annan
                &amp; taught in Annan Academy which figures in "Sarton Resartus"<ptr target="loc.02520_n3"/> &amp; this is called
                Carlyle's Place. Annan is also the birthplace of his great friend, Edward Irving<ptr target="loc.02520_n4"/> to
                whose memory a statue is now proposed to be erected.</p>
            <p>I must ask you to pardon my writing more at present as it is nigh mail time</p>
            <p>My best wishes <hi rend="underline">for your</hi> welfare</p> 
            <closer>
