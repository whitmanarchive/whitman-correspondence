                <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have very often felt that I should like to write to you and tell you how much
                pleasure and instruction your books have given me, and now I have determined that I
                will do so, because I have just read November Boughs<ptr target="n3999"/> and am so much pleased with
                it.</p>
            <p>I have been watching for it to be published for some time, ever since I saw in The
                Pall Mall Gazette that you were engaged on it. Some of the poetical pieces in it
                please me greatly.</p>
            <p>I have long cared for Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days.<ptr target="n4121"/> I love nature so much myself
                that there is much in Specimen Days that appeals to me. I have often experienced the
                feeling of absorbing into myself, physically and spiritually, the very life and
                spirit of nature. It is a thing that must be felt to be understood. The other papers
                in that book are interesting to me too. The broad and deep views you take of the
                future of democracy in America—everything connected with America—is a most
                interesting study to me. Your poems touch me very deeply as all true poetry that
                comes from the heart must do.</p>
            <p>Please accept my best wishes that the year we have entered upon may bring to you much
                calm peacefulness, and that you may experience much comfort and sympathy in return
                for that which you have so generously given to others during your life.</p>
            <p>I hope you will not think that I shall expect any reply to this, for I know how weak
                you are, and that you are not able to reply to all the letters that you receive.<ptr target="syr.00053_n1"/></p>
            <closer>
                <salute>I am, my dear sir, yours very truly and gratefully,</salute>
