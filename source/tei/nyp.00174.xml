         <p>I<ptr target="nyp.00174_n100"/> write these few lines to you in order that you may know where I am and also that I am in the enjoyment of middling good health  I heard from you through my Father some time ago and I have wanted to visit you but I am sorry to say my health will not admit of my being out much this cold weather<ptr target="nyp.00174_n2"/>. If you remember I was wounded through my lung and the ball is now near my right kidney and I am not as healthy as I use to be before I was wounded.</p>
            <p>I feel quite well to day I have just received a letter from my Brother in my Regt (15th NJ) he spoke of you. I wrote him concerning you and he says he would like to see you. I think I owe you a thousand thanks for your kindness to me while in Hospt at Washington. I have often thought of you and wished I could hear from you. I would like to hear from that Lady who did so much for me. I think it was Miss Howard<ptr target="nyp.00174_n3"/>. I think I will be well enough to come and see you in a week or two&#8212;and then we will talk over all the incidents of our short acquaintance in Washington. If you will answer this and set the day I will come and see you. I am a little deaf now from the earache but I hope we will get along with that. Hoping to hear from you soon I subscribe myself yours faithfully</p>
