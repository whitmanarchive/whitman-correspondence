            <p>A beautiful July day. Warm enough but not hot. All here peaceful and quiet. Am in my
                office, it is now noon. I have attended chapel, written a few letters (to
                    Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/> and others) &amp; pause to think, to take stock of
                my surroundings and what is next to do. I had a long good letter from Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> two days ago. He is a good fellow—you have no better
                friend I like him well for your sake and for his own.</p>
            <p>No word from Willy Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> for about a week I expect him home
                almost daily—he has had some delay—some work he could not
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00771.jpg" type="verso"/>
            get done as expected—guess he must be about over the hitch by this time.</p>
            <p>I say, Walt, what became of that letter of Symonds'<ptr target="n0615"/> to you which
                you were going to send me some months ago?<ptr target="loc.07355_n2"/> You were
                going to have it set up but I guess did not—Has Horace got it or where is it?
                I should like much to see it.</p>
            <p>I had a card a few days ago from Mrs O'C.<ptr target="n4137"/> It seems to be hot
                down there in Washington—there is no place can beat <hi rend="underline">right
                    here</hi> in the summer—it is a lovely place and a most charming summer
                climate</p>
