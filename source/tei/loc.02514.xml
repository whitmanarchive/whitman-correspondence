            <p>Please accept of my warmest thanks for your kind postcard of Aug 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi><ptr target="loc.02514_n2"/> 
                from which I was glad to hear <supplied reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="high">that</supplied> you were 
                "keeping around much as usual," but sorry to know
                that you were troubled with insomnia &amp; had bad nights. It grieves me to hear of
                your continued prostration &amp; suffering &amp; to know that I can do nothing for
                you but write 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02514.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                stupid letters, while you are constantly showering Blessings &amp; Gifts upon me.</p>
            <p>I have received so many of these from you that I hesitate about accepting your last
                generous offer to "order the W.W. clay head<ptr target="loc.02522_n4"/> at 40 Grosvenor r'd London" to be 
                sent to me or to Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/></p>
            <p>You ask me if I "w<hi rend="underline">d</hi> care for" it. Indeed, and I would do much more than care for
                it. I would prize it very, very highly &amp; would give it a place of honour in
                my home second to none of my possession<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="high">s</unclear></p>

            <p>About the time you receive this letter my dear friend, Wallace,
                will arrive at Phila.<ptr target="loc.02508_n5"/> &amp; will shortly after see you face to face &amp; hold brief
                &amp; loving converse with you, if you are well enough to see him, as I sincerely trust you
                will be. The mere thought of his meet<unclear reason="illegible" resp="#smb" cert="high">ing</unclear> you fills me with undescribable emotion
                &amp; my heart fairly wells with love for you both &amp; I long to be with you &amp;
                to enjoy the sweet communion which will be his.</p>
            <p>But I must content myself with retrospective

                pleasures which to me <gap reason="illegible" quantity="3" unit="chars"/> very very
                precious; &amp; henceforth will be doubly so now that my dear friend can enter

            <p>God bless you both!</p>
            <p>A good letter from him, at Queenstown&#8212;all going on well with him&#8212;in
