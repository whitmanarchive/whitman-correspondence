            </opener>
            <p> I received tonight an elaborate card of introduction to the "Manhattan Safety
                Deposit Vault Company." Now, by Croesus! Now, by Momus! Let us join hands and roll
                and expire in laughter! If my accumulation of shoes&#8212;my cast-off
                shoes&#8212;like wine and Old
                    Daubs were increased in value by cobwebs and mould and boomerang kicks against <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01616_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01617_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Fate&#8212;I
                might&#8212;I might, <hi rend="underline">then</hi>, I say,&#8212;so numerous be
                those unmendable boots&#8212;have much joy in knowing that at least one Safety Deposit Vault Company in
                the land boasted a receptacle wide and deep and strong enough to house and protect my
                feet. </p>
            <p> (P.S. The "boomerang kicks" refer to the boots&#8212;not the Daubs.) </p>
            <p> I believe as you do that "the bitch" likes to hear herself talked about. She
                evidently overheard your remarks in the letter before me and has taken revenge upon me as <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">above</unclear> by chaining me <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01618_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_vm.01619_large.jpg" type="recto"/> to her rock and
                inviting me to feast upon viands beyond
                reach. So is mythological history repeated! As a matter of fact "the bitch" has
                sentenced me to walk past the identical Deposit place six times a week. But, to filch again from the riches of
                your letter: "Lets talk about something else." "Poverty be d&#8212;d and avaunt!" I'm
                going now to perform the feat of taking a drink and lighting a pipe in one and the
                same breath. Ah-h-! I came so near accomplishing this feat that a dimpled Bacchus in
                an oval frame smiled most <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_vm.01620_large.jpg"

                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_vm.01621_large.jpg" type="recto"/> approvingly and I
                fancied I heard a rustle as though Sir Walter Raleigh<ptr target="loc.04894_n2"/>
                had suddenly sat upright in admiration. My only sorrow at this moment is in that: its
                the last drink in the bottle and two blocks to where my credit is unimpaired and the
                rain coming down in torrents. But, by Neptune! "all accoutred as I am" I'll plunge
                me in and swim it! I've got a new pipe&#8212;a clay of fantastical mould from Paris&#8212;and it is <choice>

            <p> You are right&#8212;as you always are: I will not attack or reflect <pb

                <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="loc_vm.01623_large.jpg" type="recto"/> in any way upon
                    <hi rend="underline">Puck</hi>. </p>
            <p> Your letter gives me comfort in more ways than one.<ptr target="loc.04894_n3"/> But first of all in its
                protestations of undying love&#8212;which, even to the remotest corners of my heart, I
                believe to be as true as the ring of pure gold. Dear Old Man! the possession of such
                coin requires no Safety Deposit Vault nor bolts nor bars other than the tendrils that
                entwine all true hearts, and its possession is wealth beyond all petty standards of
                valuation. I rejoice with with you at the prospect of sojourning in the
                mountains&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf005v" facs="loc_vm.01624_large.jpg" type="verso"/><pb xml:id="leaf006r" facs="loc_vm.01625_large.jpg" type="recto"/>if so it can be.
                I rejoice with you that there are still other strings of your stringing with latent
                music in their tension. May Fortune&#8212;no longer a spiteful spinster, but the
                beautiful, blooming, blushing goddess that she is!&#8212;smile upon you her
                sweetest smile and fold you in her warmest embrace. </p>
            <p> I sent you Saturday four <hi rend="underline">Pucks</hi> and a <hi rend="underline"
                    >Life</hi>. I will not bother you with the sketches in <hi rend="underline"
                    >Judge</hi>. Now, Old Man, tell me which sketch you like. Concerning "the word
                with the bark on" in "Mandy"&#8212;it was too late to change it as it had already been
                accepted when your letter came to me. </p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf007r" facs="loc_vm.01627_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p> That long sentence is the commencement line of my last sketch&#8212;"Mirandy, the Featherless
                Maid", and is accepted by Mr. Munkittrick,<ptr target="loc.04894_n4"/> for <hi rend="underline">Puck on
                    Wheels</hi>. It will be my first appearance in this Annual. "The Ghost of
                Grassmere" will probably appear in <hi rend="underline">Life</hi> tomorrow&#8212;if not
                then&#8212;next week, and I will send it to you. </p>
