                <salute>My dearest Friend</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>It did me much good to get your Poem&#8212;beautiful earnest eloquent words from the
                soul whose dear companionship mine seeks with persistent longing, wrestling with
                distance &amp; time. It seems to me, too, from your having spoken the Poem <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02879.002.jpg" type="verso"/> yourself I may
                conclude you have made fair progress. What I would fain know is whether you have
                recovered the use of the left side so far as to get about pretty freely, and to have
                as much open air life as you need &amp; like; and also whether you have quite ceased
                to suffer distressing sensations in the <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">head. If</supplied> you can say yes to the first
                question, will you in sign of it put a dash under the word <hi rend="underline">London</hi>, &amp; if yes to the second under <hi rend="underline">England</hi>
                when you next send me a paper? <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02879.003.jpg" type="recto"/> Unless indeed the paper itself contain a notice of your health.
                But if it does not that would be an easy way of gladdening me with good news, if
                good news there is. I wish I could send you good letters, dearest Friend, making
                myself the vehicle of what is stirring around me in life &amp; thought that would
                interest you; for there is plenty. But that is very hard to do&#8212;though I watch,
                hear, read eagerly full of interest. Everything <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02879.004.jpg" type="verso"/> stirs in me a cloud of questions, makes
                me want to see its relationship to what I hold already. I am for ever brooding
                pondering, sifting, testing&#8212;but that is not the bent of mind that enables one
                to reproduce <choice>
                    <sic>ones</sic>
                    <corr>one's</corr>
                </choice> impressions in compact &amp; lively form. So please dear Friend, be
                indulgent, as indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine with their
                details of my children &amp; their iterated &amp; reiterated expressions of the love
                and hope and aspiration <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02879.005.jpg" type="recto"/> you have called into life within me&#8212;take them not for what they are, but
                for all they have to stand for&#8212;Beatrice<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n1"/> --> is at Colne (having got well through the exam: we were anxious
                about in the autumn) and is a very great comfort to my Mother&#8212;as I well knew
                she would be; for a more affectionate, devoted, care-taking nature does not
                breathe&#8212;with a strong active mental life of her own too. So, though missing
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">her sorely, I

                she should be there; &amp; the country life &amp; rest are doing her a world
                    <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">of good.</supplied>
                My artist boy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n2"/> --> is working away cheerily at the R. Academy,
                his heart in his work. Percy<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n3"/> --> is coming to
                spend Xmas <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">with
                    us&#8212;he, too, continues</supplied> well content <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">with his work</supplied> and in good health.
                    Gracie<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n4"/> --> is blooming. The Rossettis<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n5"/> --> have had a
                heavy affliction this first year of their married <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">life in the premature death of</supplied> her only
                brother&#8212;a young man of <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">considerable</supplied>

            <p>The Conways<!-- <ptr target="n0170"/> --><!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n6"/> --> are well. I feel
                more completely myself than I have done since my illness&#8212;so you see dear
                friend if it has taken me quite four years to recover the lost ground one must not
                be discouraged if two do not accomplish it in your case.&#8212;I hope your little
                    nieces<!-- <ptr target="loc.02879_n7"/> --> at St. Louis are
                well&#8212;and the brothers you are with, and that you have <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02879.008.jpg" type="verso"/> many dear friends round you at
                Camden.</p>

            <p>I think my thoughts fly to you on strongest and most joyous wings when I am out
                walking in the clear cold elastic air I enjoy so much. </p>
