            <p>It did me much good to get your Poem—beautiful earnest eloquent words from 
                the soul whose dear companionship mine seeks with persistent longing, wrestling 
                with distance &amp; time. It seems to me, too, from your having spoken the Poem 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.00268.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                yourself I may conclude you have made fair progress. What I would fain know is 
                whether you have recovered the use of the left side<ptr target="duk.00621_n14"/> 
                so far as to get about pretty freely, and to have as much open air life as you 
                need &amp; like; and also whether you have quite ceased to suffer distressing 
                sensations in the head. If you can say yes to the first question, will you in 
                sign of it put a dash under the word <hi rend="underline">London</hi>, &amp; if 
                yes to the second under <hi rend="underline">England</hi> when you next send me 
                a paper? 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_cb.00269.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                Unless indeed the paper itself contain a notice of your health. But if it does 
                not that would be an easy way of gladdening me with good news, if good news there 
                is. I wish I could send you good letters, dearest Friend, making myself the vehicle 
                of what is stirring around me in life &amp; thought that would interest you; for 
                there is plenty—But that is very hard to do—though I watch, hear, read 
                eagerly full of interest—Everything 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00266.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                stirs in me a cloud of questions, makes me want to see its relationship to what 
                I hold already. I am for ever brooding pondering, sifting, testing—but that 
                is not the bent of mind that enables one to reproduce <choice><sic>ones</sic><corr>one's</corr></choice> 
                impressions in comport &amp; lively form. So please dear Friend, be indulgent, as 
                indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine with their details of my 
                children &amp; their iterated &amp; reiterated expressions of the love and hope 
                and aspiration 
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc_cb.00272.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                you have called into life within me—take them not for what they are but for 
                all they have to stand for—Beatrice<ptr target="n0260"/> is at Colne 
                (having got well through the exam: we were anxious about in the autumn) and is a 
                very great comfort to my Mother—as I well knew she would be; for a more 
                affectionate, devoted, care-taking nature does not breathe—with a strong 
                active mental life of her own too. So, though missing her sorely, I am
                <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc_cb.00274.jpg" type="verso"/>
                well satisfied she should be there; &amp; the country life &amp; rest are doing 
                her a world of good. My artist boy<ptr target="n0262"/> is working away 
                cheerily at the R. Academy, his heart in his work. Percy<ptr target="n2000"/> 
                is coming to spend Xmas with us—he, too, continues well content with his 
                work and in good health. Gracie<ptr target="n0261"/> is blooming.</p> 
            
            <p>The Rossettis<ptr target="loc.02879_n5"/> have had a heavy affliction this first 
                year of their married life in the premature death of her only brother<ptr target="n0456"/>—a young 
                man of considerable
                <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc_cb.00275.jpg" type="recto"/> 
                promise—barely 20.</p>

            <p>The Conways<ptr target="n0170"/> are well. I feel more completely myself than I 
                have done since my illness.—so you see dear friend if it has taken me quite 
                four years to recover the lost ground one must not be discouraged if two does not 
                accomplish it in your case.—I hope your little nieces<ptr target="loc.02879_n7"/> 
                at St. Louis are well—and the brothers you are with, and that you have 
                <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc_cb.00271.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                many dear friends round you at Camden.</p>

            <p>I think my thoughts fly to you on strongest and most joyous wings when I am out 
                walking in the clear cold elastic air I enjoy so much.</p>
