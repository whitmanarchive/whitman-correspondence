            <p>Yesterday I gave a letter of introduction to you to a lady friend of mine, Miss Helen
                Moore. Miss Moore was speaking to me of your poetry yesterday as she and I were
                walking through the galleries of the Louvre, she is an intellectual lady and she
                admires <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02363.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> a great
                deal you have written, she enjoyed so much your lecture on the assassination of
                Lincoln. She leaves Paris for her home in Philadelphia in a few weeks, stopping at
                London on her way. </p>
            <p>Miss Moore has just had her first book published, "Mary Wolstonecraft
                Shelley" and I think you would feel that it was well written if you should read
                    it.<ptr target="loc.02363_n1"/></p>
            <p>I feel sure you will <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02363.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> find pleasure in Miss Moore's company for she is very
                appreciative. </p>
            <p>I was more than pleased to receive the papers you sent me in which I found so much
                about you. I am sorry I could not have heard the lecture on Lincoln, there is a
                spirit and movement to your work that I feel directly. </p>
            <p>I hope you are better and able to get about without trouble. <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02363.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> If you can find time and strength
                to write me even a line I shall be much pleased. There is something about a written
                word from one that brings more happiness than anything excepting the person himself. </p>
            <p>Again many thanks for the papers and I trust that the letter of introduction I gave
                to Miss Moore will be agreeable to you and you will not feel I have taken too much
                liberty. </p>
