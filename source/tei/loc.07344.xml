            <p>I have yours of 23<hi rend="underline">d</hi><ptr target="loc.07344_n2"/> (posted 
                24<hi rend="underline">th</hi>) it came to hand last evening, it and also Mrs
                Costelloe's<ptr target="loc.07344_n3"/> (accompanying it) were heartily welcome. Am glad that you seem to be no
                worse—but what is this about Harry Stafford?<ptr target="n0590"/> I fear from what you say he is in
                a bad way, but what is it?<ptr target="loc.07344_n7"/> It has been a terrible winter all about here for sickness
                and deaths and I guess it is no better your way from what you say—I want to
                know if there is any prospect of you giving a lecture on or about 15 April<ptr target="loc.07344_n5"/>—if
                there is I shall try to be on hand. If I go I shall probably spend a day or two in
                Phila', then a day or two in Baltimore, a day or two in Washington and a few days at
                the seaside (Atlantic City perhaps) just
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00734.jpg" type="verso"/>
                to get a little change and a mouthful of fresh sea air. Did I tell you that we have
                arranged for the money to get tools to make the meter? I think Gurd<ptr target="n4284"/> will go east for
                the tools about 2<hi rend="underline">d</hi> April and will be back here with them (I hope) early in
                June—so far all looks well for the meter and if it actually turns out
                according to appearance at present I may be a better off man after this year in which
                case I hope to see more of you and (if that is possible) do more for you. Mrs Bucke<ptr target="n4273"/>
                and little Pardee<ptr target="loc.07344_n6"/> are still in Sarnia, they are having a good time and it is doing
                them good I guess—All quiet here, plenty of work, but as long as we can do it
                we must not grumble at that—still, if I had my own way I would have a little
                less work and a little more rest</p>
            <p>I hope to see you before very long and am, with love, your friend</p>
