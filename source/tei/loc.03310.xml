                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have long wanted to write to you&#8212;just in the way of comradeship and greeting,
                and two years ago did begin a letter, when living among the miners of the North, on
                your birthday night; (I enclose a leaf from a journal of the time, to show how old
                the intention is;)<ptr target="loc.03310_n2"/> to-night however there is further
                cause which I hope you will think warranty enough, if <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03310.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> indeed it is not foolish to speak
                of wanting any warranty in this sense at all. Before turning to the more immediate
                purpose of these lines, though, let me say simply in a young man's way to you who
                are an old man now, how dearly and earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night,
                remembering the Past, looking on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young
                men you have helped me most powerfully &#38; perfectly. So if I do not frame exact
                wishes in birthday fashion, it is because the usual formula is all useless. <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03310.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> (I had not
                remembered it was your birthday this morning, and in not the best of states of
                health went off with "<hi rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi>" under my arm to
                Chelsea Hospital, &#38; lay there under a tree&#8212;the sun shining summerly&#8212;reading,
                until suddenly I found myself on the way back full of vigour and energy for work.
                Then bethinking that your birthday fell in May, I took up "<hi rend="underline"
                    >Memoranda of the War</hi>," and there behold:&#8212;<hi rend="underline"
                    >31st</hi>! and I determined to write before bed-time. All day you have been my
                only companion, for I live alone in this happy garrett of mine, &#38; except the folks
                of the house have not seen a familiar face, though I went off to see the
                fashionable, foolish crowd in Hyde Park this afternoon. So the day has been sacred
                to you as it were: <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03310.004_large.jpg" type="verso"
                /> and you have been unwittingly a guest in this little room, where I have
                entertained Shakspeare &#38; Chaucer &#38; other great souls before this.)</p>
            <p>The special message in hand referred to before is about a proposed edition of your
                poems in a small popular series&#8212;called (foolishly &#38; without reason), "<hi
                    rend="underline">The Canterbury Poets</hi>."<ptr target="loc.03310_n3"/> When
                the series had been already begun, a friend of mine,&#8212;Joseph Skipsey, (a former
                coal-miner, a genuine poet in speech if not in writing, and a noble soul,)<ptr
                    target="loc.03310_n4"/> was asked to assist in the editing. So when a few months
                back I saw in an advert'mt. your name in the list of proposed poets, having then
                already left the North for London, to study life &#38; literature here,</p>
                <p>lung-inflammation&#8212;serious to so old a man, but happily seems to be recovering,
                happily for me at any rate that is, who <choice>
                    <sic>know</sic>
                    <corr>knows</corr>
                </choice> few people in this great London. And now, hoping you will be able to send
                me one word of sanction
                &#38; greeting at least.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>I am, dear Poet,</salute>
                <salute>Yours affectionately</salute>
