            </opener>

            <p>I have been home to Brooklyn, N. Y. on a visit to my mother, but I am now back here again, 
                and am well as usual, and working in the same place. Your letter of August 15, 
                and the letter of Oct. 2, have both reached me, &amp; I was very glad to hear from you &amp; your folks, 
                &amp; to get such friendly letters. Dear boy, I should like much to pay you a visit, 
                &amp; to be with you 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01561.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                for a while, &amp; to become acquainted with your father &amp; mother—it would be a real comfort to me, 
                &amp; I am determined to come one of these days—I often think about it, &amp; about you too, 
                dear friend, &amp; one of these days we will see each other again.
            </p>
            
            <p>There is nothing very new in my affairs. I have had quite a <choice><orig>pleas-ant</orig><reg>pleasant</reg></choice> summer, 
                &amp; now the fall is here—the past three weeks has been splendid weather here, both days &amp; nights—but <choice><orig>to-day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice> there is a heavy rain—looks as if it had set in for a long storm—</p>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01561.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
            <p>—I am living at a boarding house, the same place where you come to see me, but new landlord 
                &amp; landlady<ptr target="loc.01561_n2"/>—472 M st.—it is quite pleasant—mostly young people, full of life &amp; gayety—then I go to my work at 9, &amp; leave at 3—so you see it is easy enough—In about three weeks more it will be lively times here in Washington, as Congress is to meet then, &amp; there will be some important questions brought up—but I take all these things very coolly—&amp;, since the war is over, <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> allow myself to get excited—</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01561.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>You must write to me often as you can. I shall probably remain here this winter. I wish you to give my love to your father &amp; mother. They do not seem at all like strangers to me.
            </p> 
                
            <p>And now Alfred I must bid you farewell for the present, my loving boy &amp; comrade.—When you write, write to me about the farm, &amp; the farm-life, crops, horses, &amp;c. for I like to hear about such things too.
            </p>
