            <p>I thought I would write you just a line, though I have nothing of importance&#8212;only the talk of the street here seems more &amp; more to assert that Burnside's army is to remain near here to protect Washington &amp; act as a reserve, so that Grant can move the Army of the Potomac upon Richmond, without being compelled to turn &amp; be anxious about the Capital&#8212;also that Burnside can attend to Lee if the latter should send any force up west of here, (what they call the valley of the Shenandoah)&#8212;or invade Pennsylvania again&#8212;I thought you would like to hear this&#8212;it looks plausible, but there are lots of rumors of all kinds&#8212;I cannot hear where Burnside's army is as they dont allow the papers to print army movements&#8212;but I fancy they are very near Washington, the other side of Arlington heights, this moment<ptr target="loc.00821_n1"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I wrote yesterday to Han, &amp; sent one of George's last letters from Annapolis&#8212;Mother, I suppose you got my letter of Tuesday 26th&#8212;I have not heard any thing from you in quite a little while&#8212;I am still well&#8212;the weather is fine, quite hot yesterday&#8212;Mother, I am now going down to see a poor soldier who is very low with a long diarrhea&#8212;he cannot recover&#8212;when I was with him last night, he asked me before I went away to ask God's blessing on him, he says, I am no scholar &amp; you are&#8212;poor dying man, I told him I hoped from the bottom of my heart God would bless him, &amp; bring him up yet&#8212;I soothed him as well as I could, it was affecting, I can tell you&#8212;Jeff, I wrote to Mr Kirkwood<ptr target="loc.00821_n2"/> yesterday to 44 Pierrepont st., he sent me some money last Monday&#8212;is Probasco<ptr target="loc.00821_n3"/> still in the store in N Y?&#8212;dear sister Mat, I quite want to see you &amp; California, not forgetting my little Hattie too&#8212;</p>

               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Just as I am going to mail this, I receive authentic information. Burnside's army is now about 16 or 18 miles south of here, at a place called Fairfax court house&#8212;They had last night no orders to move at present, &amp; I rather think they will remain there, or near there&#8212;What I have written before, as a rumor, about their being to be held as a reserve, to act wherever occasion may need them, is now quite decided on&#8212;You may hear a rumor in New York that they have been shipped in transports from Alexandria&#8212;there is no truth in it at all&#8212;Grant's Army of the Potomac is probably to do the heavy work&#8212;his army is strong &amp; full of fight. Mother, I think it is today the noblest army of soldiers that ever marched&#8212;nobody can know the men so well as I do, I sometimes think&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I am writing this in Willard's hotel,<ptr target="loc.00821_n4"/> on my way down to hospital after I leave this at post office&#8212;I shall come out to dinner at 4 o'clock &amp; then go back to hospital again in evening&#8212;</p>
            <p>Good bye, dear Mother, &amp; all&#8212;</p>
