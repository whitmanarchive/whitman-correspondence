            <p>I have no excuse to offer for this letter&#8212;only an explanation. Of course, I. have been
                familiar with your name for years, but only recently have I had opportunity to get and study
                "Leaves of Grass." Being a confirmed and rather melancholy invalid myself&#8212;something
                in that book overwhelmed me with sorrow&#8212;a sorrow not quite like anything I ever felt
                before. I contrast the picture in that book of the sturdy young man, with the one in The
                "Magazine of Poetry"&#8212;and the contrast chokes me with emotion. Then and
                <hi rend="underline">NOW</hi>!! Life's morning&#8212;the strong bird, with its wild,
                jocund song&#8212;soaring, singing over the mountain tops, along

                early childhood, but was, by fate planted in such a stern, cold, barren soil, that I have, in turn, suffered
                leaf-flight and twig-flight, and with a fair enough outside, shall fall, at last, with my heart eaten
                out&#8212;dead at the core.</p>
            <p>We, writers, ought not to be surprised at any cranky
                correspondence, but if this letter surprises or annoys you, you must blame the influence of
