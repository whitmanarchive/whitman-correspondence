            </opener>
            <p>I got your pleasant letter, and thank you for the attention you paid my note through
                Mr. Cummins<!--annotation--> I feared our aggressiveness (perhaps my mulishness) on
                the 20 percent and other mooted questions had obliterated on your side, our
                friendship. I am happy in begging your pardon. &amp; I have not seen Townsend<!-- <ptr target="n0643"/> --> since his return over the water, but I had a talk with his
                beautiful and intelligent wife in <choice>
                    <orig>Phila</orig>
                    <reg>Philadelphia</reg>
                </choice> &amp; she said that not only did Townsend admire you and yours but that he
                had also weaned <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01832.002.jpg" type="verso"/> her
                from a prejudice. I do not believe that man exists whom Townsend is more anxious to
                know intimately than lusty Walt Whitman. You will both be gratified one of these
                days, for it is your and his Destiny. I wonder if I will lose two "bully" friends,
                when you two come together?</p>
            <p>Cummins is a whole <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#al">sound</unclear>, but erratic, fellow, and a good companion. He regards his
                friendships warmly. I'm glad you met him.</p>
            <p>I should like to see Burrough's&gt;<!--annotation--> book on
                you<!-- <ptr target="n0678"/> -->, &amp; will pay the price &amp; postage if he will
                send it to me. However I expect to be in Washington in a couple of weeks &amp; I can
                secure the <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01832.003.jpg" type="recto"/> essay then.
                The health of self &amp; family is better than for sometime past&#8212;thanks to the
                pure air of the mountains. I think I never appreciated the country before&#8212;its
                flowers, its trees its rocks &amp; its brooks, to say nothing of the greenness of
                the grass or the perfumed air. I have looked for the name in the corner of the
                Lord's pockethandkerchief many times here &amp; I dare not say I have not found
                it.</p>
            <p>Write me again before I see you.</p>
            <p>The Ramsdell family here <choice>
