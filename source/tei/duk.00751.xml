                <salute>Dear Tom</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I was glad to have word from you, once more, &#38; glad to get the particulars of that race&#8212;this is the first full account I have heard, &#38; I am real pleased, Tommy, first at the satisfaction of your winning, and next at your raking in the good stakes&#8212;altogether it must have been quite a time&#8212;</p>

            <p> Yes Dr Bucke was here, and we had a very pleasant afternoon and evening together&#8212;had a first rate dinner&#8212;and then in the hotel sitting room some of the tallest kind of talking &#38; arguing you may be sure.<ptr target="duk.00751_n2"/></p>
            
            <p>I live very quietly &#38; plainly here, board with my brother &#38; sister-in-law&#8212;have a nice little room up in the third story fronting south (I am sitting here now in a great rocking chair, &#38; the sun is pouring in bright and warm as you please&#8212;I wish you was here, Tommy, to spend the afternoon with me)&#8212;</p>

            <p>I have some work to-day, most every day a little, but I take it easy, content if I can make enough to pay my expenses&#8212;I never cared to be rich, (no possibility of that any how) but I dont care to be too poor either.</p>
            
            <p>I get out on the river, (the Delaware) or over in Philadelphia most every day&#8212;lately I go down to the Ferry at nights &#38; cross over &#38; back two or three times. The river is full of ice &#38; the boats have a pretty tough time&#8212;but the nights are light, the full moon shining like silver, and I enjoy it all&#8212;(Know the pilots and boat hands intimately.) Last night was perfect, &#38; only middling cool&#8212;I staid crossing till 12 o'clock&#8212;felt good&#8212;&#38; then got hungry &#38; went and got a dozen nice oysters &#38; a drink (Dont that make your mouth water, Tommy boy?) I often think of you and the boys &#38; girls&#8212;give my best respects to all of them, Dick Flynn, Tom Bradley<ptr target="duk.00751_n3"/> &#38; all the cricket boys&#8212;that was the best summer there in Canada, &#38; among you all &#38; the Asylum grounds, &#38; the daily rides into London &#38; all, that I ever put in &#38; I am feeling the benefit of it yet. My love to you, Tom, &#38; am glad you dont forget me, as I won't you&#8212;try to write to me regular&#8212;</p>
