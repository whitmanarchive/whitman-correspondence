                donated the freedom of the city (what is it?) in a gold box, to-morrow night, at the
                sailor's church in Roosevelt street. Mr. Banvard<ptr target="med.00972_n4"/> departed yesterday
                for Europe, with his panoramas of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers. Of
                course, he will make a good "spec" there, in all probability. His success has given
                rise to a host of imitators. We have panoramic views, now, of nearly all the
                principal rivers of the country. We have even on exhibition here pictures of matters
                and things as they were before the Deluge—doubtless a very correct
                representation. Nothing of importance was done yesterday, at the Episcopal
                Convention; it only organized—electing Dr. Creighton<ptr target="med.00972_n5"/> of Tarrytown, as
                President, and Rev. Mr. Haight,<ptr target="med.00972_n6"/> Secretary. One of the disturbing
                questions to come before these potent, grave and reverend signors, is that of the
                admission, on equal terms with whites, of congregations of colored churches. That is
                one branch of the great question. Of course it is very important—to the
                parties concerned.</p>
            <p><handShift rend="printed"/>I hear in the city this morning of the death of Michael
                Hoffman,<ptr target="med.00972_n7"/> Naval officer, for this city; he was aged sixty years,
                and died last night at his residence in Pacific street, Brooklyn. Mr. Hoffman was a
                well-known politician of the Radical stamp, and had filled offices in the
                Legislature and other positions. He was much beloved by the Silas Wright<ptr target="med.00971_n11"/> democracy,
                who were in daily expectation of hearing of his removal by the National Executive,
                at Washington. The removal, however, has been by a more solemn power, and more
                potent mandate. He is to be taken this afternoon to Herkimer county, his former
                residence, for burial.</p>
