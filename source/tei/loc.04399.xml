                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
                Here I am in Albany on my way south.<ptr target="loc.04400_n2"/> I leave here by the 8 o'clock
                boat tomorrow morning for New York, &#38; expect to arrive at about
                5 pm. I shall probably stay with A. H. Rome<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> (Brooklyn) till Monday
                morning, &#38; then come on to Camden.</p>
            <p>
                I left Port Hope yesterday morning &#38; crossed Lake Ontario to
                Charlotte for Rochester. I didn't get so much enjoyment from crossing
                the lake as I hoped for, as the day was dull with strong winds.
                And though not actually seasick, I was nearer it than I ever was before,
                &#38; more or less uncomfortable during most of the time! But I got
                <hi rend="underline">some</hi> enjoyment from it notwithstanding.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00992_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>It was a little after six when I got to Rochester, &#38; I decided to stay
                there all night.&#8212;Left &#64; 9-55 this morning arriving at Albany
                &#64; 4.50. Though the morning was dull, it cleared up &#38; the afternoon
                has been beautiful &#38; I have enjoyed the ride very much 
                indeed&#8212;especially down the lovely valley of Mohawk River.</p>
            <p>
                I hope for a good time tomorrow on the Hudson, &#38; shall be glad
                at the close to see Mr Rome&#8212;&#38; to receive letters &#38; news
                of you. (Have received no letters since last Monday but one.)</p>
            <p>
                I hope with all my heart that things have gone well with you &#38;
                that when I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> hear, the news will be good.
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00993_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I am quite longing for letters&#8212;from Camden &#38; from Bolton.</p>
            <p>My coming to Camden on Monday will be contingent on Ingersoll's<ptr target="n0839"/> lecturing
                that evening&#8212;as I want to hear him. But if he does 
                <hi rend="underline">not</hi>, I propose to visit West Hills
                before coming.</p>
            <p>I was startled today to see the news of Parnell's<ptr target="loc.04399_n2"/> death.
                Poor fellow! His turbulent career is ended <hi rend="underline">so</hi>!
            </p>   
            <p> 
                Dear Walt, dearest of friends, it is not without some
                trepidation that I come to see you again.
                For <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will be "disillusioned"!
                But my love to you only grows deeper with time, &#38;
                though <hi rend="underline">that</hi> doesn't count for much,
                I come as the agent of friends<ptr target="loc.04707_n3"/> whose love 
                <hi rend="underline">does</hi> count, &#38; whom I am sure that you
                too would love. (Though, for the matter of that, whom do you
                <hi rend="underline">not</hi> love?)
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00994_large.jpg" type="verso"/></p>
                <p>And I feel almost as though not only my friends are represented
                (unworthily) by me, but as though there were more between us than that.
                For when I saw you, you reminded me strangely &#38; strongly of my
                dear mother,<ptr target="n6121d"/> &#38; I almost felt as though she too were present,
                &#38; that you were her messenger &#38; representative. And however
                fanciful <hi rend="underline">that</hi> idea may seem (though I felt
                it strongly at the time) yet I am sure that a higher Presence still
                was there, &#38; that God himself, who had led me to you, blessed me
                far beyond my deserts or old time anticipation in permitting
                me to see you. God bless you for all you have done &#38; been to me
                &#38; to my friends (lovers of you). I write lamely,
                but warm hearts&#8212;manly &#38; true&#8212;in Bolton beat in unison
                with all I can say of love &#38; gratitude &#38; blessing.
            </p>
