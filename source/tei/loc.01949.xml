            <p>The weather here, is remarkably cold for the time of year, it freezes <hi rend="underline">hard</hi> every night. April 16<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi>, there fell 11 inches of snow and people rode
                with the sleigh, there are no gardens made yet, but I have plants in my hot bed big
                enough to be transplanted. Papa wrenched his back last Thursday, and has been laid
                up ever since.</p>

            <p>I am not much of a young man yet, I am 17 years old, all but a few days, but very
