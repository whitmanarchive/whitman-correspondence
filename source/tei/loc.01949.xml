            <p>I received your letter by Monday <choice>

            <p>I did not expect to hear from you so soon after writing nevertheless, I was just as
                glad to hear from you, I wrote in my last letter that we knew nothing about uncle
                    George.<ptr target="loc.03675_n2"/> well, shortly after I had written to you we
                received a letter from him. this was on Friday night, and on the <choice>

                    <expan>West</expan>
                </choice> 43<hi rend="underline">rd</hi> St. where I found uncle <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_gt.00210_large.jpg" type="verso"/> George at No. 35,
                so, if you will do <hi rend="underline">him</hi>, as well as me, the favor of
                writing to him, you will please both of us, direct to No. 35 <choice>

                    <expan>West</expan>
                </choice> 43 St. I suppose you know Arthur Henry.<ptr target="n5001"/> well, he is
                keeping the place near the 5<hi rend="underline">th</hi> Ave. Stage Stables, and
                there is where George is staying. since Papa saw him, he has had very sore feet and
                legs, so bad that he could not have worked, even if he had had it. they were
                considerable better when I was there. I got there about 10 o'clock, and took dinner
                with him, then we went down to Fulton Ferry, with Nick Speer,<ptr target="loc.01949_n1"/> a 5<hi rend="underline">th</hi> Ave. driver, and a great
                friend of Uncle George. I guess you dont know Speer, he belongs in Paterson.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_gt.00211_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>well, we went to Fulton Ferry, and I <hi rend="underline">was</hi> to take boat from
                Peck's ship to go out on <choice>
                    <abbr>L. I.</abbr>
                    <expan>Long Island</expan>
                </choice> but, the boat was not running, so I crossed from James's ship to Hunter's <choice>
                    <abbr>Is.</abbr>
                    <expan>Island</expan>
                </choice> and took the cars from there to Great Neck. I have a cousin living there
                whom I went to visit. I left Uncle George at James' Ship. I suppose you have read
                all about the new P.O. in <choice>
                    <abbr>N.Y.</abbr>
                    <expan>New York</expan>
                </choice> It is a splendid building and is nearly finished. The Astor house has sold
                out its old Furniture and everything, and the building itself is undergoing repair
                the inside and front are all taken out, and it is to be fixed up <hi rend="underline">splendid</hi>. The <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_gt.00212_large.jpg" type="verso"/> East River bridge does not seem to
                be getting on very fast I believe the piers are not quite finished. I suppose you
                have heard that several of convicts have escaped from Blackwells, and Boss Tweed<ptr target="n0715"/> is to be released. Dan Bryant<ptr target="n5001"/> died, a week
                ago last Saturday.</p>
            <p>The weather here, is remarkably cold for the time of year, it freezes <hi rend="underline">hard</hi> every night. April 16<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,
                there fell 11 inches of snow and people rode with the sleigh, there are no gardens
                made yet, but I have plants in my hot bed big enough to be transplanted. Papa<ptr target="nyp.00175_n100"/> wrenched his back last Thursday, and has been laid up
                ever since.</p>
            <p>I am not much of a young man yet, I am 17 years old, all but a few days, but very
                small for my age I would not be taken for more than 13</p>
            <p>I go to school every day, answer soon</p>
