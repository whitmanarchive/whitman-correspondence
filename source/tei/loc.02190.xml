            <p>For the last 3 weeks I have been upon the point of penning you a little description
                of a little town I and my sister have just taken down in Devon &amp; Somerset. I
                don't know whether you have scenery like Lyme-regis in America, rich in
                thistles tangled weeds &amp; smooth grass growing down to the waters edge. Had some
                capital bathes in the sea.&#8212;always think of you when I am by the sea.&#8212;it
                was a <unclear reason="illgible" cert="low" resp="#nhg">shingly</unclear> coast at
                low water, so I went in, in a pair of old boots to protect my feet from the
                stones.</p>

            <p>At an old farm in Somerset at a village&#8212;West Lambrook&#8212;There was a great
                chimney corner in which a body could sit on the oak settle and see a star or two up
                the chimney, how jolly it was and how you would have revelled in it I could but
                think.</p>

            <p>I heard some strange Somersetshire stories, this is one&#8212;Lord Portman's steward
                died a rich man and willed at his death his best horse should be killed &amp; buried
                by his side in order that at the day of resurrection, he could mount his steed and
                be fast in at the day of judgement. And to circumvent evil disposed persons who
                might dig him up for the new <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02190.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> harness upon the horse, his men sat up ploughing all night over
                his grave so that no one could identify the spot: this happened some 20 or 30
                years since. The Somersetshire men put a Z in everything, "I zaid I zhould."</p>

                think he and Emerson are mistaken in thinking manliness predominated over intellect
                with C&#8212;truer I should say of dear old Dr. Johnson.</p>

                genially too.</p>
