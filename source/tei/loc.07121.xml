            <p>Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> has gone and I shall (do) miss him much&#8212;he is a
                thoroughly good fellow. We took him in to the 11.30 train this A.M. and he ought to
                reach Phila at 7 A.M. tomorrow. His visit was far too short but we had a good time
                while it lasted&#8212;make him tell you about our drive to Delaware
                yesterday&#8212;Horace, Dr. Sippi<ptr target="loc.07121_n1"/>, P.E. Bucke<ptr
                    target="loc.07121_n2"/> and Self&#8212;we had a grand time. On our way to the
                station this morning I got from you a card (27th I guess)<ptr target="loc.07121_n3"
                />&#8212;tell Horace I have not seen the Whitman piece mentoned in it and ask him to
                send it me&#8212;unless you send it yourself. Horace will tell you how we all are
                and what we are doing here. I have your card of 26th<ptr target="loc.07121_n4"/>
                and Phila Press of same date (thanks for it) the little piece in
                it&#8212;"Whitman&#8212;Ingersoll&#8212;Death" might have been worse&#8212;but it
                also might have been a good deal better without being anything wonderful. Send and
                get "Brief for Plaintiff" Bacon vs. Shakespeare. 25e Rand &#38; McNally Chicago.<ptr
