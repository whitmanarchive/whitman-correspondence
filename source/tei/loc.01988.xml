            </opener>
            <p>Sunday Evening has come around again and I find myself again employed in the pleasant
                duty of answering one of your ever welcome letters. I rec'd yours of Jan 31<hi
                    rend="superscript">st</hi><ptr target="n5002d"/> last night, and will not lose
                any time in answering it this time, but I do not know as you will approve of my
                writing on Sundays, but that is about the only time I have for writing except
                evenings and then my hands tremble so from my work (which is nearly all done by the
                hands) that I can scarcely write <choice>
                    <sic>inteligibly</sic>
                    <corr>intelligibly</corr>
                </choice> so I feel certain you will excuse me. <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01472_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I also received your "Leaves" of
                "Grass" and the pamphlet the "Good" "Gray" Poet,<ptr target="n0272"/> which I shall
                prize so highly that no money could purchase it but I do not know as you ought to
                have sent it to me, for I do not know as you could afford it, but I will try and
                repay you for it, if in no other way than Love which I can give from the heart.</p>
            <p>The vindication I have read part of it and Father<ptr
                    target="n0811"/> has read the rest of it to us, and I shall take the liberty of
                disagreeing with you in regard to his thinking more of you than you deserve for you
                deserve his love as well as that of thousands of others myself included, and I wish
                you to give him my best regards and tell him I am one <gap reason="illegible"
                    extent="2" unit="words"/> of friends that was visited <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc_vm.01473_large.jpg" type="recto"/> in Armory Square Hospital<ptr
                    target="n0043"/> by his Good, Gray, Poet, Walt Whitman, and that I hope some day
                to make his acquaintance in person. I think Mr O'Connor was perfectly sane in
                writing his vindication, and I thank you very much for
                sending it to me for it has done me good already.</p>
            <p>When I get to thoroughly reading your Book I shall probably have some questions to
                ask but I shall not get as bigoted as Secretary Harlan,<ptr target="n0287"/> and
                wish to turn you out of employment for your plainness of speech for I have failed as
                yet to find any indecent passages.</p>
            <p>I have been talking and thinking very strongly of going to South America next spring
                to be gone a year or two and see if I could not get into <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.01474_large.jpg" type="verso"/> something there that would be of
                benefit to me financially. I have not decided what part of the country I would go to
                yet and I want to get your advice on the subject for I am not very well posted. Give
                me your opinion freely, and say whatever you wish to say on any subject. If I should
                go I would try to spend a day or two with you in Washington</p>
            <p>I will try and give you a better letter next time I write, for I am not in very good
                writing mood <choice><sic>to night</sic><corr>tonight</corr></choice>. 
                enclosed is some cards Fac Simile of those I sent you in the letter you
                did not get. I did not know but you would like to have them.</p>
