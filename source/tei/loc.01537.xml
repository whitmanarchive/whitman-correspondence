                <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>It is pretty much the same with me, as when I wrote my former letters&#8212;still
                home here with my mother<!--<ptr target="n0705"/>-->, not busy at any thing particular but taking a good deal of
                comfort&#8212;It has been very hot here, but one stands it better here than in
                Washington, on account perhaps of the sea-air&#8212;I am still feeling well, &#38;
                am out around every day.</p>

            <p>There was quite a brush in N. Y.<!--<ptr target="n0325"/>--> on Wednesday<ptr target="loc.01537_n2"/>&#8212;the Irish lower orders (Catholic) had determined that the Orange
                parade (protestant) should be put down&#8212;mob fired &#38; threw
                stones&#8212;military fired on mob&#8212;bet. 30 and 40 killed, over a hundred
                wounded&#8212;but you have seen all about it in papers&#8212;it was all up in a
                distant part of the city, 3 miles from Wall street&#8212;five-sixths of the city
                went on with its business just the same as any other day&#8212;I saw a big squad of
                prisoners carried along under guard&#8212;they reminded me of the squads of rebel
                prisoners brought in Washington, six years ago&#8212;</p>

            <p>The N. Y. police looked &#38; behaved splendidly&#8212;no fuss, few words, but <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi>&#8212;great, brown, bearded, able, American looking
                fellows, (Irish stock, though, many of them)&#8212;I had great pleasure in looking
                on them&#8212;something new, to me, it quite set me up to see such chaps, all dusty
                &#38; worn, looked like veterans&#8212;</p>

            <p>Pete, dear son, I rec'd your two letters, &#38; was glad to get them&#8212;</p>

            <p>Mother has been quite sick, &#38; I have been sort of nurse, as she is here alone,
                none of my sisters being home at present&#8212;she is much better this morning,
                under my doctoring&#8212;</p> 

            <p>Pete, I see by your letters that every thing goes on right with you on the
                road&#8212;give my best regards to my friends among the drivers &#38;
                conductors&#8212;Dear son, I shall now soon be coming back, &#38; we will be
                together again, as my leave is up on the 22d<ptr target="loc.01537_n3"/>&#8212;I
                am now going to take a bath &#38; dress myself to go over to New York. Love to you,
                my dearest boy, &#38; good bye for this time&#8212;</p>
