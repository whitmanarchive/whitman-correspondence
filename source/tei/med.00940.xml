              <p>I feel like writing at once about something that has delighted me. In talking with Thomas 
              Sergeant Perry<ptr target="med.00940_n2"/> last night we fell to discussing your work, and to my delight I found him a 
              great and unequivocal admirer of your work. I was pleased beyond measure, for Mr. Perry's 
              opinion on your work is more valuable to me than that of any man in America—with one 
              exception. Mr. Perry is a man of vast learning. He is a historian of literature. He knows 
              the development of all Western literature, he is just finishing a large volume—very 
              radical—on the Greek literature, he has written on German and English literature. 
              His criticisms are based not on personal feelings but upon principles—he looks at 
              any man from the <hi rend="italic">comparative standpoint</hi>. He is the leader of that school of thought 
              with us here. So you see this has value—this opinion of his. He has been abroad 
              for some years studying and now is writing on various historical lines. Mr. Howells<ptr target="n4317"/> 
              and he were two of my most honored friends.</p>
