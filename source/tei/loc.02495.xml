            <p>How can I thank you for all the tokens of your loving-kindness which you are so
                constantly sending me? I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> thank you enough but I can
                at least shew you that I am grateful &amp; appreciative of your bountiful generosity
                by writing to you as often as possible &amp; doing my little best to extend <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02495.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> your influence
                &amp; speak about you whenever opportunity offers. My latest convert to the
                "brotherhood" is a working-man—a machine fitter—named George
                    Humphries<ptr target="loc.02495_n2"/> who lives in a narrow side street, &amp; who has
                a genuine interest in you personally (through reading my "Notes"<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/>) &amp; I mean to
                give him a copy of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> one of these days.</p>
            <p>The arrival of your good letter of June 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr target="loc.02495_n1"/> on July 8<hi rend="underline">th</hi> your parcel of
                photographs <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02495.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> on
                the 9<hi rend="underline">th</hi> &amp; of the <hi rend="underline">Lippencott</hi> proof<ptr target="loc.02495_n5"/> this monrning has cheered me
                &amp; brightened these three days for me in a way that I cannot describe &amp; I can
                only say thanks, dear Friend &amp; Master, a thousand thanks!</p>
            <p>Your dear letter says that you were then "getting on fairly." Glad to hear <hi rend="underline">that</hi> piece of good news.</p> 
            <p>God grant that at this moment you are still "getting on fairly" at least, though I
                hope sincerely that <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02495.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> you are gaining strength &amp; getting out into the open air a
                little now &amp; then, &amp; we shall all rejoice when we hear of your doing
                this.</p>
            <p>What a grand selection of portraits you have sent me! And oh, how I prize them not
                only for their intrinsic value &amp; interest but chiefly because they have come
                from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. But I fear that you must have despoiled yourself
                in parting with some of them. Thanks to you all the more for your munificent
                kindness!</p>

            <p>Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> called here for a few minutes last night, &amp; shewed
                me your p.c. to him. I gave him the duplicates &amp; a facsimile copy of your letter
                to me. I am having some of the portraits mounted; &amp; as the large head is fading
                I shall copy it so as to preserve it. That &amp; O'Connor's<ptr target="n2002"/>
                favourite are my favourites in the "budget"; but each of them is characteristically
                interesting &amp; I like &amp; value them all very much indeed.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02495.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>You must have had a wonderfully smart stenographer "on the job" for such a graphic
                report of the Birthday "Spree"<ptr target="wau.00003_n3"/> to have been sent to <hi rend="underline">Lippincott</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02495_n3"/></p>
            <p>I read the proof over hurriedly &amp; sent it on at once to Wallace &amp; I could not
                but admire its fidelity &amp; vivid portrayal of the actual event &amp; much credit
                is due to H.L. Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> &amp; the reporter for so admirably
                reproducing &amp; fixing the really able speeches &amp; the interesting proceeding
                of that memorable evening.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02495.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I thank you most cordially for the complimentary reference to my "Notes" wh. you made
                &amp; for all the good words you said about Wallace &amp; the Boys. My only fear is
                that, after the laudation we have received, Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> will be
                disappointed when he sees us!</p>
            <p>But I cannot refrain from here giving an extract from a letter I have just received
                from Wallace. He says:—</p>
            <p>"I feel that in coming to see us he (i.e Dr B) does far more than pay us honour on
                his own person I feel very strongly (whether <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02495.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> you will understand me &amp; share
                my feelings or not) that his visit like all our relations with Walt is a celestial
                &amp; priceless message of benison &amp; cheer &amp; hope from the Highest. I wish
                to feel it a <hi rend="underline">consecration</hi> too, to better effect in the
                future to absorb &amp; assimilate &amp; put into practice the teaching &amp;
                influence of our beloved master and Friend."</p>
            <p>Will you please kindly thank H.L.T. for his share in sending us the proof &amp; tell
                him not to trouble about sending any of the magazines as we can get them here?</p>
            <p>With kindest regards to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> Harry<ptr target="loc.07663_n4"/> &amp; Mrs. Davis<ptr target="n6113"/> &amp; to H.L.T. &amp; with best love &amp; gratitude to you
