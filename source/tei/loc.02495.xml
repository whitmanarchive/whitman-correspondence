            <p>How can I thank you for all the tokens of your loving-kindness which you are so
                constantly sending me? I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> thank you enough but I can
                at least shew you that I am grateful &#38; appreciative of your bountiful generosity
                by writing to you as often as possible &#38; doing my little best to extend <pb

                &#38; speak about you whenever opportunity offers. My latest convert to the
                "brotherhood" is a working-man&#8212;a machine fitter&#8212;named George
                    Humphries<ptr target="loc.02495_n2"/> who lives in a narrow side street, &#38; who has
                a genuine interest in you personally (through reading my "Notes"<ptr target="loc.02495_n4"/>) &#38; I mean to
                give him a copy of <hi rend="underline">L. of G.</hi> one of these days.</p>
            <p>The arrival of your good letter of June 27<hi rend="underline">th</hi>,<ptr

                    >Lippencott</hi> proof<ptr target="loc.02495_n5"/> this monrning has cheered me
                &#38; brightened these three days for me in a way that I cannot describe &#38; I can
                only say thanks, dear Friend &#38; Master, a thousand thanks!</p>
            <p>Your dear letter says that you were then "getting on fairly." Glad to hear <hi
                    rend="underline">that</hi> piece of good news.</p> 
            <p>God grant that at this moment you are still "getting on fairly" at least, though I
                hope sincerely that <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02495.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> you are gaining strength &#38; getting out into the open air a
                little now &#38; then, &#38; we shall all rejoice when we hear of your doing
                this.</p>
            <p>What a grand selection of portraits you have sent me! And oh, how I prize them not
                only for their intrinsic value &#38; interest but chiefly because they have come
                from <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. But I fear that you must have despoiled yourself
                in parting with some of them. Thanks to you all the more for your munificent
                kindness!</p>

            <p>Wallace<ptr target="n6121"/> called here for a few minutes last night, &#38; shewed
                me your p.c. to him. I gave him the duplicates &#38; a facsimile copy of your letter
                to me. I am having some of the portraits mounted; &#38; as the large head is fading
                I shall copy it so as to preserve it. That &#38; O'Connor's<ptr target="n2002"/>
                favourite are my favourites in the "budget"; but each of them is characteristically
                interesting &#38; I like &#38; value them all very much indeed.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02495.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>You must have had a wonderfully smart stenographer "on the job" for such a graphic
                report of the Birthday "Spree"<ptr target="wau.00003_n3"/> to have been sent to <hi rend="underline">Lippincott</hi>.<ptr target="loc.02495_n3"/></p>
            <p>I read the proof over hurriedly &#38; sent it on at once to Wallace &#38; I could not
                but admire its fidelity &#38; vivid portrayal of the actual event &#38; much credit
                is due to H.L. Traubel<ptr target="n4267"/> &#38; the reporter for so admirably
                reproducing &#38; fixing the really able speeches &#38; the interesting proceeding
                of that memorable evening.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.02495.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>I thank you most cordially for the complimentary reference to my "Notes" wh. you made
                &#38; for all the good words you said about Wallace &#38; the Boys. My only fear is
                that, after the laudation we have received, Dr Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> will be
                disappointed when he sees us!</p>
            <p>But I cannot refrain from here giving an extract from a letter I have just received
                from Wallace. He says:&#8212;</p>
            <p>"I feel that in coming to see us he (i.e Dr B) does far more than pay us honour on
                his own person I feel very strongly (whether <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                    facs="loc.02495.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> you will understand me &#38; share
                my feelings or not) that his visit like all our relations with Walt is a celestial
                &#38; priceless message of benison &#38; cheer &#38; hope from the Highest. I wish
                to feel it a <hi rend="underline">consecration</hi> too, to better effect in the
                future to absorb &#38; assimilate &#38; put into practice the teaching &#38;
                influence of our beloved master and Friend."</p>
            <p>Will you please kindly thank H.L.T. for his share in sending us the proof &#38; tell
                him not to trouble about sending any of the magazines as we can get them here?</p>
            <p>With kindest regards to Warry<ptr target="loc.07319_n6"/> Harry<ptr target="loc.07663_n4"/> &#38; Mrs. Davis<ptr
