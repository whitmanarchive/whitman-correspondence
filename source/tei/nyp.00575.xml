                <salute>Dear friend</salute>  
            </opener>
            <p>Yours rec'd<ptr target="nyp.00575_n3"/> &amp; welcomed, as always—I send Vol.
                of "Specimen Days and Collect," with emendations—My notion would be for you to
                print a Vol. including all to page 200, and call it <hi rend="italic">"Specimen Days
                    in America—By Walt Whitman"</hi> for title page, &amp; then another Vol.
                of the matter from page 203 to 338 (including "My Book &amp; I" which I send) &amp;
                call it <hi rend="italic">"Democratic Vistas and other papers" by Walt Whitman</hi>
                for title page—<hi rend="italic">making two books</hi>—</p>
            <p>But I leave the thing, (after having expressed my suggestion, &amp; sent you the
                copy) in your &amp; the publisher's hands, with full authority from me to do what
                the exigencies require, &amp; what you think best<ptr target="nyp.00575_n2"/>—should I feel like writing a few lines for Preface, I will send you within
                ten days—but if not, not—It is not certain—If you don't get such
                lines from me go on without them when you are ready—Should you wish the print
                facing page 222 I can get it for you, printed here in Philadelphia by the 100 or
                1000—(I think it is ab't 3cts a piece, but am not certain)—or I will
                send you the photo &amp; you can have one made there, if you prefer to have your own
                as you may—Write me often as you can—I am tied up in my corner by
                paralysis, &amp; welcome friends' letters—bad cold raw weather—my bird
                is singing furiously—I am ab't as usual—</p>

                <p>I have put a couple of photos in the book, at page 122—one is for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>—the other I think you can <hi rend="italic">transfer</hi> &amp; make for yourself a good plate for picture for the
                    book—I like it better to go in the vol. of the book off against the scene
                    in the text described (as at p. 122)—tell the pub. when he sends me my 10
                    guineas to send (if convenient) in P.O. order, (or orders) to me at 328 Mickle
                    st. Camden New Jersey—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Write soon, &amp; specifically, &amp; copiously</hi>—I
                    will send you the lith. portraits you request—If you want another copy of
                    "Spe. Days," to make proper printer's copy, get one of Wilson's Glasgow
                    Ed'n—it is correct—mind my emendations—Go &amp; see B F C
                        Costelloe<ptr target="n3133"/>, 40 Grosvenor Road, the embankment, &amp; ask
                    to be introduced to his wife, Mrs. C.<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> She is an
