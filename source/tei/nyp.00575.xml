                of "Specimen Days and Collect," with emendations&#8212;My notion would be for you to
                print a Vol. including all to page 200, and call it <hi rend="italic">"Specimen Days
                    in America&#8212;By Walt Whitman"</hi> for title page, &#38; then another Vol.
                of the matter from page 203 to 338 (including "My Book &#38; I" which I send) &#38;
                call it <hi rend="italic">"Democratic Vistas and other papers" by Walt Whitman</hi>
                for title page&#8212;<hi rend="italic">making two books</hi>&#8212;</p>
            <p>But I leave the thing, (after having expressed my suggestion, &#38; sent you the
                copy) in your &#38; the publisher's hands, with full authority from me to do what
                the exigencies require, &#38; what you think best<ptr target="nyp.00575_n2"

                ten days&#8212;but if not, not&#8212;It is not certain&#8212;If you don't get such
                lines from me go on without them when you are ready&#8212;Should you wish the print
                facing page 222 I can get it for you, printed here in Philadelphia by the 100 or
                1000&#8212;(I think it is ab't 3cts a piece, but am not certain)&#8212;or I will
                send you the photo &#38; you can have one made there, if you prefer to have your own
                as you may&#8212;Write me often as you can&#8212;I am tied up in my corner by
