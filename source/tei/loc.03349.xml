                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener> 
            <p>I was rejoiced to get your card of yesterday this morning.<ptr target="loc.03349_n3"/></p>
            <p>The blindness still continues, but with half an eye I send you a word to let you know
                that I'm not dead yet, no more than you are, dear friend! The pleasing little malady
                of the eyelid which has inspired me to much eloquent, though silent, profanity, is
                called <hi rend="underline">ptosis</hi>, a Greek name which is fully equivalent to
                Abaddon (and a bad'un it is: joke: two in <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03349.002.jpg" type="verso"/> this style for one cent!) and
                consists in a paralysis of the first nerve of the eyelid. The doctor continues the 
                battery, and promises relief soon, warning me not to use the other eye, which I
                don't, with slight exceptions, such as this one. Soon I hope to send you better than
                this myopian notelet.</p> 
            <p>I was glad to see Mrs. Costelloe's<ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> letter, which I sent
                the next day to Dr. Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> (old angel!) and have heard he got
                it.</p>  
            <p>I am pleased that Stedman<ptr target="n1043"/> wrote to you. I suppose it <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03349.003.jpg" type="recto"/> included telling
                you the delay of the calendar<ptr target="loc.03349_n4"/>, for which I am not sorry on the whole, since it gives
                another chance to get the help of Stetson's grand Fuseli-pencil<ptr target="loc.03349_n5"/> for the design of another year.
                Grace is going to touch this spirit to fine issues if possible next twelve-month,
                when we hope he will be freer to work!</p>
            <p>—But, whoa! eye-destroying prose. Pegasus of the devil—It fills me with
                thanks that you still hold your own, dear Walt. I'll bet on you more <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03349.004.jpg" type="verso"/> than on either
                Harrison or Cleveland!<ptr target="loc.03349_n1"/> (Apropos, what a delicious mess
                Bull-Sackville has got himself into! The tee-heeing and haw-hawing are
                multitudinous! Also the Democratic roars!<ptr target="loc.03349_n2"/>)</p>  
            <p>Nelly sends love. More annon.</p> 
            <closer>
                <salute>Always affectionately,</salute>
