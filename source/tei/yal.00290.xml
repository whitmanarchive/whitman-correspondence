            <p>I <choice><abbr>recd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> your card yesterday, &amp; also the English paper.<ptr
                    target="yal.00290_n1"/> This morning Doctor Bucke<ptr target="n0119"/> sends me
                Williams<ptr target="n2002"/> letter. It makes me groan in spirit to think of Williams condition. But

                </choice> it somewhat, 
                for this letter shows streaks of the old fire.<ptr target="yal.00290_n2"/> 'Tis a pity he sits down &amp; lets this thing
                creep over him. He could <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="yal.00290.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>do much to fight it off, or keep it at bay, if he would make the
                effort you have made, or if he would take a sea voyage. I think I must go to W. this
                winter &amp; see him. I have some notion of going south to get a glimpse of the
                tropics.</p>
            <p>I like your Lippincott paper;<ptr target="yal.00290_n3"/> it is very dignified &amp;
                impressive, &amp; contains many very effective sentences. I am so glad you are
                writing again. My own health is pretty good. I think I have been much benefited <pb
                    xml:id="leaf003r" facs="yal.00290.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> the past fall by
                drinking vichy water. It has reduced my weight about 10 per cent. My belly has gone
                away as if I had been confined. It might be good for you. It is good for those who
                make too much blood &amp; fat. It reduces &amp; thins the blood, &amp;, with me, it
                corrects the too much uric acid. I am eating but two meals a day, the last at <choice>

            <p>The Quarterly Review article to which <choice><abbr>O'C.</abbr><expan>O'Connor</expan></choice> refers I have read.<ptr
                    target="yal.00290_n4"/> It is very fine, many strong &amp; penetrating things
               said about you. <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="yal.00290.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>I should like to know who wrote it. It is in the same number that
                poor Gosse<ptr target="n0273"/> gets such a terrible cutting up. The New Zealanders
                book I had not heard of.<ptr target="loc.03321_n1"/></p>
            <p>Your book will doubtless have a checkered career in the future as it has had in the
                past, but I have no more doubt that it is one of the few immortal books than I have
                of my own existence. The world can never long pass it by. If it suffers centuries of
                eclipse &amp; neglect it is bound to come up again.</p>
            <p>Study into the causes of your bad spells &amp; I believe you may master them, or
                mitigate them. The <choice><orig>bowells</orig><reg>bowels</reg></choice> are the seat of the difficulty with you, I believe. Dr
                Bucke says he is well, &amp; lecturing on insanity to medical students.<ptr
                    target="yal.00290_n5"/> I enclose O'C.'s letter.</p>
