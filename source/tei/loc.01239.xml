            <p> I had yours of 3 Aug<ptr target="loc.01239_n1"/>&#8212;acknowledging receipt of
                draft. Sorry to hear you were troubled with sunstroke. I hope you are going on
                pretty well again now. We were very pleased that the money came in handy&#8212;I
                haven't been in London lately or seen Mrs. Gilchrist<ptr target="n0259"/> or <choice>

                </choice> friend Mary (?) <choice><sic>Whittall</sic><corr>Whitall</corr></choice><ptr target="loc.02189_n1"/> whom you mention. I
                rather expect to be that way in about a month or so. Am laid up just now with a kick
                from my horse&#8212;luckily nothing very bad&#8212;he struck me (accidentally in <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01239.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> a way&#8212;the
                kick being probably meant for another horse that was teasing him) just above the
                knee on the front of the thigh&#8212;so no bones broken, but it is a big bruise and
                it will be a week or two before I can get about. It is wonderful though how nature
                sets to work directly to put things right, and it has been peaceable &amp; free from
                pain. </p>
            <p> I have plenty to do looking over proofs&#8212;I am bringing out a 2<hi
                    rend="superscript">nd</hi> edition, enlarged, of Towards Democracy&#8212;also a

                </choice> I am interested in &amp; hope it will provoke some discussion&#8212;it is
                a direct attack on the validity of scientific <pb xml:id="leaf002r"

                generally&#8212;not that I don't think Science has been very useful, but that it is
                time that it should 'climb down' a bit. </p>
            <p> Do you see anything of <choice><abbr>yr</abbr><expan>your</expan></choice> young friend McKinsey<ptr target="n3106"/> or has he left Philadelphia? I send you
                a photo I had taken a little time ago with a young fellow who is an old friend of
                mine&#8212;in Sheffield&#8212;it is not very good of me, though very fair of <choice>

            <p> The farm gets on&#8212;slowly&#8212;but still it moves, and I rather expect in a few
                months to put it on a distinct cooperative footing. </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01239.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p> Prices are awfully low&#8212;owing apparently to the general depression and the fact
                that the <hi rend="underline">mass of the people</hi> are without money&#8212;also
                perhaps, partly to a growing scarcity of gold. </p>
            <p> Isabella Ford<ptr target="loc.01238_n2"/> has had an accident since we wrote, but I do not know exact particulars.
                She was driving with her Mother &amp; the ponies ran away&#8212; Isabella climbed out,
                probably thinking she <choice><abbr>cd</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> render some assistance, &amp; fell, hurting her
                shoulder. However, she was much better when I last heard. </p>
            <p> Hope you keep going pretty well&#8212;I often think of you &amp; wish we could have
                a chat. </p>
