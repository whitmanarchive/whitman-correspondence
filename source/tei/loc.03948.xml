                <salute>Dear "Walt Whitman"&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>For years I have owed you a debt. I would not say it in any other way&#8212;so I am
                trying to get others to take from you just as largely. I am writing a paper for one
                of our Boston Clubs&#8212;and it is to be all about you&#8212;in your <hi
                    rend="underline">Leaves</hi> of Grass. Of course it has all been better said,
                but I must have my chance just the same. <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00350_large.jpg" type="verso"/> I am defending your <hi
                    rend="underline">Children of Adam</hi>. All at once it occurs to me:
                "Why&#8212;these were written years ago. He is older now. He may wish he had written
                differently. In a few years I may not defend them so vehemently. I had better ask
                him what I shall say." So&#8212;this letter goes to trouble you. I want more than I
                can tell, to go to you, to sit beside you and talk about death and life; I know how
                birth and the beginning <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00351_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> of birth seem to you now&#8212;after these years of illness and
                years of religious thought&#8212;and years of looking into the far future. You may
                not be able to write&#8212;but what can I do? Shall I go on and will you trust me to
                say that every line, if rightly read, will give help? </p>
            <p>Dear Walt Whitman: For years I have wanted to write to you&#8212;but knew I had no
                right to take your minutes and your strength. Now I seem
                compelled&#8212;yet&#8212;fear to trouble. Forgive me <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00352_large.jpg" type="verso"/> if I need not have come even
                now&#8212;and believe me&#8212;your grateful friend&#8212;and&#8212;may I not say
                lover?</p>
