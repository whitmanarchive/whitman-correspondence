                <p> From a perusal of your delightful book, "Specimen Days in

                <p> I am preparing for publication a work entitled "Dickens portrayed by pen and
                    pencil," an important feature of which will be (as the enclosed prospectus
                    shows), several unpublished reminiscences of the <pb xml:id="leaf001v"

                    by his most intimate friends. </p>
                <p> I venture to ask if you will lend your valuable aid in promoting the success of
                    my scheme by favouring me with a record of your recollections and impressions of
                    Dickens. So many of his friends having willingly acceded to my wishes in this
                    respect, that I feel justified in entertaining a hope that the nature of the
                    subject may induce you to do likewise. </p>
                <p> I need hardly say that anything from your hand, whether of a personal <pb

                        <handShift rend="printed"/>Some misapprehension appears to exist with regard
                        to the second feature of this work. A few of the author's correspondents
                        evidently suppose he contemplates a work of a biographical nature; an
                        intention which, cognisant as he is of the existing "Life" by Forster, he
                        hastens to disclaim; nor has he the remotest intention of entering into
                        competition with that admirable biography. This declaration he trusts will
                        suffice to remove any objection on the part of <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                            facs="loc.02590.008_large.jpg" type="verso"/> the few whose
                        "impressions" would so materially enhance the interest of this work, but who
                        have hitherto hesitated to supply such particulars as would constitute a
                        "Pen-Portrait." </p>
                    <p>
                        <handShift rend="printed"/>If we could know Shakespeare as we know Johnson,
                        much would be gained. To describe Dickens, and to record the impressions of
                        those who have seen or known him, the writer hopes, is to satisfy a laudable
                        curiosity. That this may be done while opportunity remains is his sincere
                        endeavor. In this attempt he has the satisfaction of acknowledging the
                        sanction and kindly help of members of the Dickens family, the valuable
                        assistance fo those who have been co-workers with the Novelist, the cheerful
                        co-operation of artists and other friends, besides promises of further aid
                        which will be gratefully acknowledged in the proper place.&#42; </p>
                    <p>
                        <handShift rend="printed"/>Some of the author's correspondents have
                        expressed their inability to contribute to his work because they had no
                        intimate acquaintance with Dickens, and had only met him on one or two
                        occasions. He ventures to point out that personal intimacy is not absolutely
                        requisite in forming a mental impression of the outward characteristics of
                        an individual: that, in fact, mere contact will suffice for such a purpose.
                        In such a case as that of Charles Dickens, the wonderful creations of whose
                        fertile brain excited a laudable desire on the part of many of his readers
                        and admirers to behold with their own eyes the magician himself, it is
                        natural to suppose that such curiosity would induce them to critically
                        examine his outward appearance, and to form an impression that would not
                        soon be effaced. As a notable illustration of his meaning the graphic,
                        terse, and vivid portraiture by Carlyle may be given. Having met "Boz" for
                        the firs time at a dinner, he thus described his impressions of the young
                        writer:&#8212; </p>

                            features were very good. He had a capital forehead, a firm nose with
                            full wide nostril, eyes wonderfully beaming with intellect and running
                            over with humour an cheerfulness, and a rather prominent mouth strongly
                            marked with sensibility. The head was altogether well-formed and
                            symmetrical, and the air and carriage of it were extremely spirited. The
                            hair so scant and grizzled in later days was then of a rich brown and
                            most luxuriant abundance, and the bearded face of his last two decades
                            had hardly a vestige of hair or whisker; but there was that in the face
                            as I first recollect it which no time could change, and which remained
                            implanted on it unalterably to the last. This was the quickness,
                            keenness, and practical power, the eager, restless, energetic outlook on
                            each several feature, that seemed to tell so little of a student or
                            writer of books, and so much of a man of action and business in the
                            world. Light and motion flashed form every part of it."</quote>

                        The author has set about collecting with a view of presenting to his readers
                        a complete gallery, displaying an infinite variety of touch and detail, by
                        pen and pencil, the <hi rend="italic">portraiture</hi> of the subject of his
                        volume. He ventures to hope the nature of the undertaking, and the unusual
                        interest of the subject, will induce those who have not yet enlisted in the
                        service to favour him with their impressions, recollections, or any
                        reminiscences of our favourite writer. </p>
