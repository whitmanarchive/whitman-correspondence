                <salute>Dear W.</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Yours at hand. Enclosed I hand a full statement of our affairs, made up with a good deal of care, and I believe, entirely correct. I see you put the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">number</unclear> of copies of new Ed. of Leaves of Grass at 496 in your memo: It <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">was</unclear> only 494, ie. I only received and receipted for this number. You may have taken the other two from <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#js">Leiner</unclear>. I saw Dillingham, (by the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">bye</unclear>, he <hi rend="underline">was</hi> the <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Co.</unclear> of <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#nnk">Felt &amp; Co.</unclear> which firm has gone out of <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">existence</unclear>.) He declines to take the books&#8212;says sales will not warrant&#8212;there is no money in it I know, and these driving pushing fellows will not <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">do</unclear>  <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#js">any</unclear><!-- Nima saw "a " -->thing with it on that account, while others, who are <hi rend="underline">respectable</hi> in the eyes if the world, wouldn't have your books because of th<hi rend="underline">eir</hi> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">estimate</unclear> of their character. These two classes left out&#8212;It is only here and there a speckled sheep, like <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#nnk">J.R.</unclear> turns up who&#8212;not to put too fine a point upon it, don't care a <choice><orig>d&#8212;n</orig><reg>damn</reg></choice> for <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Mrs</unclear> <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Grundy</unclear>, who would take you in. What do you say to Doolady? You know Mike! He's a clever fellow and works off a good many books. If you want to go to Boston, I dare say <hi rend="underline"><unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Estes &amp;</unclear><unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Lauriant</unclear></hi> would take the books on the terms I took them. They are a new concern. I dont know any thing of them except what I see in the papers. One of them was with <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#nnk">Piper &amp; Co.</unclear>. The balance due you 63.<hi rend="underline">43</hi> will have to go in with general<!-- supplied from Library of Congress transcription. --> indebtedness. I think my estate will pay 50 cents on the dollar: hope so at any rate. I wish it was better. It has been a very poor affair for me. I havn't had <hi rend="underline">four</hi><!-- the rest of the letter, which continues on the next page, is illegible and reversed; that is, we see the verso side of the page but with the recto side's words, or something like that --></p>
