            <p>There is nothing very new &amp; I suppose George has written to you, as he returned
                about 6 p m yesterday all right&#8212;but I thought I would drop a line<ptr
                    target="uva.00433_n1"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Of course the shooting of President Garfield<ptr target="uva.00433_n2"/> is the
                general subject, &amp; has depressed me much, but for the last twenty four hours,
                his case is so much more favorable&#8212;We had the most horrible <hi rend="italic">celebration</hi> here I ever knew, commenced at dark Sunday night, continued
                all night &amp; of course next day, ruffians yelling, crackers, and all the old guns
                &amp; pistols of all Jersey, with all the bad elements of humanity completely let
                loose &amp; making the most infernal din possible to conceive for over thirty hours
                without a moments intermission&#8212;Over in Philadelphia perfectly quiet, (all the
                bad stuff probably came over here)&#8212;very hot indeed here the last four days,
                &amp; continues still&#8212;I am standing it well&#8212;I take my meals at Mrs
                    Wroth's<ptr target="uva.00433_n3"/> &amp; find it a very good place&#8212;it was
                a good move, my going there&#8212;Mrs W is very kind&#8212;Tip has been all right
                &amp; has had his meals regular&#8212;a little off his feed &amp; off <hi
                    rend="italic">his bark</hi> this morning, I suppose from the great heat, &amp;
                folks away&#8212;Arthur Stanley lives now over at the Chevaliers, with his new
                    wife<ptr target="uva.00433_n4"/>&#8212;his little boy <choice>
                    <abbr>bro't</abbr>
                    <expan>brought</expan>
                </choice> me over a nice piece of wedding cake Sunday which I took down to Alice
                    Wroth<ptr target="uva.00433_n5"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">house</hi> is all right so far&#8212;I try to keep as cool as
                I can&#8212;what with bathing &amp; ventilation, &amp; of course you will find some
                litter when you come back&#8212;</p>
            <p>I send some <hi rend="italic">Ledgers</hi>&#8212;I am writing this in the dining
                room, by open window&#8212;George was writing early forenoon, but has gone
                out&#8212;Tip has commenced a good barking at last (11&#189; oclock) after being
                quiet all the forenoon&#8212;I was afraid something was the matter with
                him&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am busy five or six hours yet every day with the copy of my book&#8212;hard work to
                get it in the shape I want it.</p>
            <p>As I finish it is after noon &amp; very hot &amp; oppressive&#8212;Love to you &amp;
                all&#8212;tell little Amy<ptr target="uva.00433_n6"/> I have not forgotten her,
                &amp; that I am going to give Tip a nice sweet coffee-cake for his
                dinner&#8212;George has just returned&#8212;</p>
