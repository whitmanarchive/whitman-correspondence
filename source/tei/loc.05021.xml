            <p>I hope you will pardon me for not acknowledging the books sooner, I did not write for

            <p>They came safely, and in good condition, and I am happy in the possession of them.
                You sent me more than I expected. I thank you for that, also for the picture.</p>
            <p>Christmas brought me a new photograph album, and I dedicated it with this you sent
                me.</p>
            <p>"If you come to Boston," Does this imply a doubt? So it seems to me.
            Come if you can. Come when you can. I suppose Boston in winter<pb xml:id="leaf001v"

                Cities, but from Spring to Autumn, I know her temples for miles around, are as varied, and beautiful, as
                the grand old architect could make them.</p>
            <p>Of course "Jack Frost" holds the key to many of these now. Still there's always
                something everywhere to make this old world a beatitude.</p>
            <p>No doubt your friend has returned to Cambridge, tho' I have not seen her; I shall
                    try to do so
                sometime soon.</p>
            <p>I am glad you are in good spirits, and fair health. I wish your powers of locomotion
            was as good. For such let us pray.</p>
