                <p>I have written so many letters to you dictated by Charles<!-- <ptr target="n0303"/> --> that I feel a painful pleasure in commencing this to you at
                    this time&#8212;knowing that his voice is silent, &amp; that no pleasant message can
                    come from his lips to you. It is useless for me to tell you how strong his
                    affection was for you, &amp; how he has looked forward to you coming to <name type="place"><choice>
                            <abbr>NH</abbr><expan>New Hampshire</expan></choice></name>. I think after your visit to him that his hold on life
                    seemed to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished. There was a
                    gentleman Mr John Matthew who was very kind to him once <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01730.002.jpg" type="verso"/>in <name type="place">New
                    York</name> when he was sick he had sent several invitations to him
                    but he put it off for some reason, &amp; he was the only one of all his friends.
                    His exit was peaceful, no struggles, a gradual giving way. He used to say&#8212;"I
                    don't believe I can die" when his sufferings were so great&#8212;it seemed as if his
                    release would never come&#8212;and although I thought he was likely to die any
                    time, still I find I was unprepared for his departure &amp; my ambition &amp;
                    hopes are all crushed. I am feeling most keenly the desolation of widowhood. I
                    look at my three children &amp; think what a work I have got
                    left to perform. The duty of
                    Father <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01730.003.jpg" type="recto"/> &amp; Mother
                    both merged in one. As far as my means go I am left very dependent&#8212;Charley's
                    protracted sickness exhausting the little he had laid by. I hope I may realize a little from the sale of pictures. I want to
                    ask you if you could at the distance I live assist me to get some writing or
                    copying to do. I thought you if anyone might know of something, &amp; you could
                    perhaps make inquiries&#8212;that might lead to my getting some business of that kind&#8212;I wish I might. Mr Townsend<!--annotation--> a dear friend of <choice>

                    &amp; shall try &amp; call upon your <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01730.004.jpg" type="verso"/> Mother. It will be always pleasant to
                    me <!-- missing "to" here is supplied by Traubel --> hear from you; any
                    &amp; every association connected with my Husband will be hallowed. The funeral
                    was Masonic and largely attended &amp; the ceremony at the grave was very
                    impressive. My Mother from Massachusetts is with me
                    for a few days and it is a great comfort.</p>
