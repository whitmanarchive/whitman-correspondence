               <p>I must beg pardon for my seeming delay abt sending the enclosed draft. But I have had so much bad luck lately in one thing and another that I could not do it sooner</p>
               <p>I have made the draft for $510<ptr target="loc.00448_n1"/>—I wish you would give the $10 to Mother as a present from Mattie</p>
               <p>Mat is pretty bad yet<ptr target="loc.00448_n2"/>—can just get around a little—very lame—but I think 'twill get away in a week or two if we have no more of the same sort—It pains me very much to see her try to walk—but she stands it like a good fellow—dont grumble a bit  I hope you have been occasioned no inconvenience by my failure to send you this on the 1st of the month  I meant to have done it but could not get matters into shape to do it till to-day—please write in regard to [receipt?] of this draft so that I may know that it came to hand safely  I believe I wrote to you or mother that Mr Lane<ptr target="loc.00448_n3"/> would take the draft after you endorsed it and put it in his bank and draw the money for you—twill save you some trouble probably—</p>
               <p>We are quite anxious to hear from Mother and the rest of you—Mat has tried to write once or twice but does not succeed—she will make an effort to-day I believe—</p>
               <p>We are having the most delight[ful] weather here just now except that it is very dry indeed—yet we are having a little shower this morning. I hope it will be a good one for we need rain—we have great troub[le]s in carrying on our work the dirt is so dry—bad weather for building Reservoirs<ptr target="loc.00448_n4"/>—</p>
               <p>How do matters go with you—is the 48 inch pipe all laid yet<ptr target="loc.00448_n5"/>—I wish you would write me occasionly and I often wonder why Mr Lane or McNamee<ptr target="loc.00448_n6"/> does not write me—certainly they are in my debt for letters—I shall give em fits if I ever get on east again—</p>
               <p>The first time you are at Mr Lanes Office I wish you would ask Johny [M. McMear?]<ptr target="loc.00448_n7"/> if he will see what taxes &amp;c are due on that lot of mine on Flatbush Av and write me and I will send him a draft if he will pay it for me—or if he will give you the statement you can write me and I will send it to you</p>
               <p>I should judge from Mothers letter that she thought you would move—do you really think that you will abandon old 1194<ptr target="loc.00448_n8"/>—You must keep me posted—Do you ever hear from Walt—I wish he would write me occasionaly—Love to Mother and all—affectionately your</p>
