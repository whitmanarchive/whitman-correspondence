               <p>I must beg pardon for my seeming delay abt sending the enclosed draft. But I have had so much bad luck lately in one thing and another that I could not do it sooner</p>
               <p>I have made the draft for $510<ptr target="loc.00448_n1"/>&#8212;I wish you would give the $10 to Mother as a present from Mattie</p>
               <p>Mat is pretty bad yet<ptr target="loc.00448_n2"/>&#8212;can just get around a little&#8212;very lame&#8212;but I think 'twill get away in a week or two if we have no more of the same sort&#8212;It pains me very much to see her try to walk&#8212;but she stands it like a good fellow&#8212;dont grumble a bit  I hope you have been occasioned no inconvenience by my failure to send you this on the 1st of the month  I meant to have done it but could not get matters into shape to do it till to-day&#8212;please write in regard to [receipt?] of this draft so that I may know that it came to hand safely  I believe I wrote to you or mother that Mr Lane<ptr target="loc.00448_n3"/> would take the draft after you endorsed it and put it in his bank and draw the money for you&#8212;twill save you some trouble probably&#8212;</p>
               <p>We are quite anxious to hear from Mother and the rest of you&#8212;Mat has tried to write once or twice but does not succeed&#8212;she will make an effort to-day I believe&#8212;</p>
               <p>We are having the most delight[ful] weather here just now except that it is very dry indeed&#8212;yet we are having a little shower this morning. I hope it will be a good one for we need rain&#8212;we have great troub[le]s in carrying on our work the dirt is so dry&#8212;bad weather for building Reservoirs<ptr target="loc.00448_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
               <p>How do matters go with you&#8212;is the 48 inch pipe all laid yet<ptr target="loc.00448_n5"/>&#8212;I wish you would write me occasionly and I often wonder why Mr Lane or McNamee<ptr target="loc.00448_n6"/> does not write me&#8212;certainly they are in my debt for letters&#8212;I shall give em fits if I ever get on east again&#8212;</p>
               <p>The first time you are at Mr Lanes Office I wish you would ask Johny [M. McMear?]<ptr target="loc.00448_n7"/> if he will see what taxes &amp;c are due on that lot of mine on Flatbush Av and write me and I will send him a draft if he will pay it for me&#8212;or if he will give you the statement you can write me and I will send it to you</p>
               <p>I should judge from Mothers letter that she thought you would move&#8212;do you really think that you will abandon old 1194<ptr target="loc.00448_n8"/>&#8212;You must keep me posted&#8212;Do you ever hear from Walt&#8212;I wish he would write me occasionaly&#8212;Love to Mother and all&#8212;affectionately your</p>
