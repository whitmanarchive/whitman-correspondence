                </choice> this morning.</note>
            <p>I write in haste<ptr target="n1027"/> to say that
                Lee<!--<ptr target="loc.05144_n2"/>--> has suddenly left Dresden, having received an
                unexpected appointment in England. So if your letter did not catch him before he
                left (last Tuesday) it is probably on its way back to you, as I hear he did not
                leave any address here. If you put it into a new envelope and address</p>
            <lg>
                <l>J. F. Lee</l>
                <l>care of Anthony Traill, F.T.C.D.</l>
                <l>Trinity College</l>
                <l>Dublin</l>
            </lg>
            <p>it will reach him. Or I could send it on as soon as I know his address, which must be
                shortly. He did not know where he would be for a couple of weeks, &#38; meant
                letters to be kept here at the place he was staying at, until he wrote for them, but
                they mistook, and tell me they had them sent back to the senders. I have nothing
                more to tell you about <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_af.01018_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> the translation, except that I am working away at it, find it
                difficult but not invincible. I have not the pen of a ready writer, and it will
                probably be a good time before the work can appear. But when it does I think it will
                satisfy you&#8212;At any rate you may rely upon it th[at] it shall be no emasculated
                version which I shall present to the German world.&#8212;I go on the principle of
                rigid literality, to the utmost extent reconcilable with making any representative
                sense. I think I can publish some bits of it now and then in a German weekly
                newspaper, the 'Gegenwart,' which has opened its columns to me before,<ptr
                    target="loc.05097_n1"/> &#38; so gradually prepare the German mind for the shock
                it is going to have!</p>
            <p>Lee's translation will probably be <hi rend="underline">postponed</hi>, owing to the
                change in his plans. But I think he will carry it through. He is mediating going in
                for a Professorship <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_af.01019_large.jpg" type="recto"
                /> of Slav languages in Dublin, (after a time) and thinks the translation would help
                him towards that end, as no doubt it would.</p>
            <p>I got your card about the <hi rend="underline">Encheiridion</hi> and the newspaper
                you kindly sent. There are always being reports in English papers about your coming
                to England soon. Is there any fact in them at all? I hope your new <choice>

                />&#8212;</p>
            <p>I feel greatly the confidence you put in me about this translation. Nothing shall be
                spared to bring it through well.</p>
