                <salute>Dearest mother—</salute>
            </opener>

            <div1 type="section"><p>Well, here I am, sitting alone in the office, Sunday, writing again to you, 
                dear mother. I rec'd your letter last week, all right. It is pleasant weather here, 
                but warm—we had a heavy rain night before last, which laid the dust. 
                There is nothing new with me, or in the office. Mr. Evarts<ptr target="duk.00653_n1"/> still remains away, 
                up on his farm at Windsor, Vermont, with his family. Ashton<ptr target="duk.00653_n2"/> runs the office—Mrs. A. returned to Washington last evening, after two months' absence—she left her little boy in New York—she is not well.
            </p>
            
            <p>The O'Connors expect to move the coming week—They have got a nice little new house, 
                two story, five rooms—it is about four or five blocks from where I live—they pay $30 a month—They are all well as usual—the Burroughs's the same—</p>
            
            <p>You would be amused to see some of the visitors I have now &amp; then—One was a middle-aged, brown-complexioned lady, a great spiritualist 
                &amp; lecturess—she broke off in the midst of the conversation—then after a while told me that she had been spoken to by the spirit of Abraham Lincoln, 
                and begged me to excuse her, as she wanted to talk with <hi rend="italic">that <choice><orig>sperit</orig><reg>spirit</reg></choice></hi>—I politely told her I would excuse her under the circumstances—&amp; off she went.
            </p>
            
            <p>Then another day a tall <choice><orig>well-drest</orig><reg>well-dressed</reg></choice> man, a perfect stranger, came, 
                &amp; said he had seen a good deal about me in the papers—said he had been an officer in the army—&amp; wanted me to get him a place 
                under government, as he was hard up—I got rid of him as gently as I could—but yesterday he came again &amp; wanted me to let him have $10!—So you see my official life, with all its monotony, is not without 
                a little fun, now &amp; then, for a change.
            </p>
            
            <p>Then I must tell you that a lady, a Mrs. McKnight,<ptr target="duk.00653_n3"/> looks &amp; acts quite a good deal like our Mary, 
                has called upon me, a few days since—&amp; I will tell you what for. 
                She is quite a portrait painter, &amp; very ambitious of being a first-rate artist. 
                At present she seems to be tolerably good. Two of her pictures I have seen, 
                are real good—Well she wants to make a portrait of my beautiful countenance 
                for herself to keep, &amp; came to ask me to sit for her—Well I consented—but don't think I shall begin until I return from my leave—So you see I have visitors &amp; applications of all sorts—</p></div1>

            <p>Well, mother, it is the last day of summer—we have had it very hot 
                &amp; melting here for two or three days—but there is a cool fresh breeze 
                blowing in here, as I finish my letter—it is quite pleasant, as we have 
                had some fine showers lately—I hope this will find you feeling well 
                &amp; in good spirits, dearest mother. Love to Georgy &amp; all—</p></div1>
