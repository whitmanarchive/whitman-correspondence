            <p>We (i.e. my wife,<ptr target="loc.04820_n4"/> my brother<ptr target="loc.04820_n3"/> a <gap reason="illegible" quantity="4" unit="chars"/> friend &amp; I) have been here since
                Friday last (July 31<hi rend="underline">st</hi>) &amp; up to now we have had a good time. A splendid
                passage across from Fleetwood brought us to Douglas—the favourite Isle
                of Man resort but now too noisy &amp; rowdy for my liking—whence we
                travelled 10 miles by tram &amp; 5 by carriage to Ballacooil
                wh. is a large farmhouse upon the sea coast
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02506.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                looking directly across the Irish Sea &amp; from wh. the Mountains of Mourne &amp;
                the Mull of Galloway are visible—it is the centre of some most 
                beautiful scenery both inland &amp; coast—the latter being
                an especial feature somewhat resembling that of the West Coast of
                Scotland tho' on a smaller scale.
            </p>
            <p>We have been favoured with splendid weather &amp; have spent our time
                in rambling about over
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02506.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                the rocks &amp; along by the seashore watching the waves &amp; the sea
                birds &amp; drinking in all the delights of the sea &amp; sky.
            </p>
            <p>Today we have had a glorious scramble over the rocks to visit the caves
                which are the haunts of seagulls &amp; cormorants &amp; we discovered
                a cormorants' nest with a young bird peering out from his lofty
                &amp; inaccessible cave
            </p>
            <p>I am writing this at sunset (830pm) sitting on a heap of stones in a
                field along which two long
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02506.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                lines of ducks &amp; geese are slowly waddling their way homeward. The
                cattle are quietly grazing, the sea is beautifully calm &amp; silvered
                with the waning light from the just-gone sun wh. a few minutes a ago
                gilded the sky with its
                sunset glory. The only sound that breaks the solemn hush is the cry of
                of a corncrake &amp; the continuous roll of the sea over the rocks
                of the Niarbyle—a promontory of rock jutting far out to sea
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02506.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            <p>The corn now 3 feet high is in full ear the fields are all bordered with
                wildflowers—yellow &amp; white marguerites, foxgloves 
                bluebelles &amp; buttercups. The hills are clad with the beautiful yellow
                gorse &amp; the purple heather. (I send you a sprig of the latter &amp;
                a seagull's feather—)

            <p>A dull hazy morning wh. cleared up by 11am &amp; resulted in a splendid
                sunny day. Five of us have just had a glorious bathe in the Sea &amp;
                enjoyed it thoroughly. We have since had a game at "cock-shie" &amp; a climb
                up the cliffs &amp; are now patiently waiting for dinner—for wh. we
                are quite ready  
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02506.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I am often wondering how you are getting along these days. Better 
                I hope—&amp; geting out into the open air now &amp; then &amp; at
                all events keeping your usual good heart 
            </p>
            <p>God bless you my dear good old friend is the heartfelt wish
                of yours affectionately</p>
