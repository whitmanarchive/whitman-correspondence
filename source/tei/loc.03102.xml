                <salute>Sir:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have received the copy of "Specimen Days &amp; Collect" which you were so kind as
                to send me, and I hope to have the opportunity soon of saying what I think about it
                in some English periodical. I have been deeply interested in the book, especially in
                so far as it supplies the 'embryons' of "Leaves of Grass", and I am especially
                gratified to receive it from yourself.</p>
            <p>My acquaintance with 'Leaves of Grass' dates from <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03102.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> my early university days some ten
                years ago, when having come across Rossetti's edition of selections I was induced
                soon after to get a complete edition. Since then I have never neglected them, and
                often enjoyed the effect of awakening others to perception of its great force and
                beauty, which being accompanied by so much which (justly or unjustly) excites
                prejudice, are too often overlooked. As regards the new book, which I have eagerly
                read, some of it was familiar to me already, e.g. Democratic Vistas&#8212;but
                'Specimen <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03102.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> Days'
                was entirely new and altogether delightful. I am inclined to think that it will
                place many readers in a better position to
                appreciate 'Leaves of Grass', than heretofore.</p>
            <p>With thanks both for this book and for former benefits received&#8212;I remain&#8212;</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours faithfully,</salute>
