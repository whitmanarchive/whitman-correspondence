                <salute>Dear W&#8212;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I sent word to Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> one day that I had an intuition that you were about to enter
                upon a new lease of life. The next day the telegraph announced you were slightly
                improved <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03184.002.jpg" type="verso"/> from a
                severe attack of "heart failure." Now Horace writes you are quite yourself again. I
                take it my spirit-sense of your condition is not likely to fail after all. But the
                hot weather is <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03184.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                coming, &#38; we shall get it by July good &#38; hot. I hope I can get into
                comfortable shape by the time it reaches Camden.</p>
            <p>Am glad Horace is at hand to afford any help <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03184.004.jpg" type="verso"/> you might need.</p>
            <p>I have about concluded not to go to the Cin. Exposition.<ptr target="loc.03184_n1"/> There is so much red tape it
                will cost me all of &#36;20 to exhibit a few busts. I am calculating on starting for Chicago
                middle of next week. I'd like to look in <pb xml:id="leaf003r"
                    facs="loc.03184.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
                on the Chicago Convention<ptr target="loc.03184_n2"/>&#8212;just to see the shape of the heads that are
                prominent.</p> 
            <p>I notice a marked difference in the political atmosphere here &#38; in Mass. People here are more
                    <hi rend="underline">rambunkious</hi>; they get mad. The republicans are high toned
                &#38; look down on democrats. If you <pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc.03184.006.jpg" type="verso"/> show any proclivities of
                democratic color they wonder how you can. How can white think well of black? And
                then, the anti-copperhead talk is still rampant here. The dems are sore some over
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="loc.03184.007.jpg" type="recto"/> the
                slaughter of Gray, &#38; Harrison<ptr target="n4269"/> would catch many sore head votes. If the Republicans have got
                to have a rushing campaign, they'll get it sooner with the freedom of old <choice><orig>Tipicanu (?)</orig><reg>Tippicanoe</reg></choice><ptr target="loc.03184_n3"/> 
                than with the cold blooded Sherman.<ptr target="n4270"/> But <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                    facs="loc.03184.008.jpg" type="verso"/> I believe <hi rend="underline"
                    >Blain</hi><ptr target="n4268"/> would sweep the States.  Every body fairly dances when his name is
                mentioned. Strange. I can't understand it. Somehow I am drawn personally more to
                Cleveland<ptr target="n4271"/> than any
                one of the others. And yet, he's a kind of a <hi rend="underline">pork</hi>.</p>
            <p>Well, this is a hot day here. I hope you keep mending, &#38; that you only went back
                a little for a new start.</p>
