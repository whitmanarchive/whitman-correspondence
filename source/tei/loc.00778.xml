            <p>I am going to write you to ask any friends you may be in communication with for aid for my soldiers. I remain here in Washington still occupied among the hospitals&#8212;I have now been engaged in this over seven months. As time passes on it seems as if sad cases of old &amp; lingering wounded accumulate, regularly recruited with new ones every week&#8212;I have been most of this day in Armory Square Hospital, Seventh st. I seldom miss a day or evening. Out of the six or seven hundred in this Hosp[ital] I try to give a word or a trifle to every one without exception, making regular rounds among them all. I give all kinds of sustenance, blackberries, peaches, lemons &amp; sugar, wines, all kinds of preserves, pickles, brandy, milk, shirts &amp; all articles of underclothing, tobacco, tea, handkerchiefs, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. I always give paper, envelopes, stamps, &amp;c. I want a supply for this purpose. To many I give (when I have it) small sums of money&#8212;half of the soldiers in hospital have not a cent. There are many returned prisoners, sick, lost all&#8212;&amp; every day squads of men from [the] front, cavalry or infantry&#8212;brought in wounded or sick, generally without a cent of money. Then I select the most needy cases &amp; devote my time &amp; services much to them. I find it tells best&#8212;some are mere lads, 17, 18, 19 or 20. Some are silent, sick, heavy hearted, (things, attentions, &amp;c. are very rude in the army &amp; hospitals, nothing but the mere hard routine, no time for tenderness or extras)&#8212;So I go round&#8212;Some of my boys die, some get well&#8212;</p>
            <p>O what a sweet unwonted love (those good American boys, of good stock, decent, clean, well raised boys, so near to me)&#8212;what an attachment grows up between us, started from hospital cots, where pale young faces lie &amp; wounded or sick bodies. My brave young American soldiers&#8212;now for so many months I have gone around among them, where they lie. I have long discarded all stiff conventions (they &amp; I are too near to each other, there is no time to lose, &amp; death &amp; anguish dissipate ceremony here between my lads &amp; me)&#8212;I pet them, some of them it does so much good, they are so faint &amp; lonesome&#8212;at parting at night sometimes I kiss them right &amp; left&#8212;The doctors tell me I supply the patients with a medicine which all their drugs &amp; bottles &amp; powders are helpless to yield.</p>
            <p>I wish you would ask any body you know who is likely to contribute&#8212;It is a good holy cause, surely nothing nobler&#8212;I desire you if possible could raise for me, forthwith, for application to these wounded &amp; sick here, (they are from Massachusetts &amp; all the New England states, there is not a day but I am with some Yankee boys, &amp; doing some trifle for them)&#8212;a sum&#8212;if possible $50&#8212;if not, then less&#8212;$30&#8212;or indeed any am't&#8212;</p>
         <p>I am at present curiously almost alone here, as visitor &amp; consolator to Hospitals&#8212;the work of the different Reliefs &amp; Commissions is nearly all off in the field&#8212;&amp; as to private visitors, <hi rend="italic">there are few or none</hi>&#8212;I wish you or some of your friends could just make a round with me, for an hour or so, at some of my hospitals or camps&#8212;I go among all our own dear soldiers, hospital camps &amp; army, our teamsters' hospitals, among sick &amp; dying, the rebels, the contrabands, &amp;c &amp;c. What I reach is necessarily but a drop in the bucket but it is done in good faith, &amp; with now some experience &amp; I  hope with good heart.<ptr target="loc.00778_n100"/>
