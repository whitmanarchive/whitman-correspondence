               <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
         <p>I was very glad to hear from you.<ptr target="loc.00948_n100"/> The letter came promptly last Friday with one from Wm. &amp; I wrote him yesterday, &amp; sent the book review. I think it is an admirable criticism, almost the best of Leaves of Grass that I have ever seen.</p>
            <p>William tells me that in the letter Curtis promises to do all he can, &amp; is very much interested, but most likely he has written you all about it.<ptr target="loc.00948_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>How comes on Drum Taps? <pb facs="loc.00948.002.jpg" type="verso"/>How is the little girl? I was more pained than I can tell you to learn that she was ill, and with one of those dreadful fevers. The poor little thing! Isn't it s pitiful thing to see a child sick? To me far more appealing than the sickness of a grown person.</p>
            <p>The critical time was Sunday last you said, now it is Tuesday, I hope she is better. Try to send me a line to say how she is.</p>
            <p>I am sorry for your sake, dear Walt, <pb facs="loc.00948.003.jpg" type="recto"/>that your mother is away. I know how you would miss her. But perhaps by this time you have gone for her. I hope you will go, &amp; will have a pleasant journey and visit.</p>
            <p>I have delayed writing that I might give you the latest news of Mrs. Ashton &amp; baby, but Charley went in there &amp; Ashton had gone home to see them.<ptr target="loc.00948_n3"/> Speed had returned, I think he was gone for a week. Mr. Pleasants said they were well when Ashton left for Philadelphia.<ptr target="loc.00948_n4"/>
               <pb facs="loc.00948.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            </p>
            <p>We miss you and William <hi rend="italic">immensely,</hi> Charley &amp; I speak of you daily.</p>
            <p>Miss Howard's sister Sallie is very sick, I think typhoid fever, &amp; I have been out to-day trying to get a nurse for her.<ptr target="loc.00948_n5"/> So far Garaphelia has taken care of her night &amp; day, &amp; she looks worn out.</p>
            <p>We are well, so is Charley. Jeannie sends love. She was very sorry &amp; sympathizing about little California. I trust the little thing is better.</p>
            <p>My sister Jeannie's little Mary is very sick with typhoid <pb facs="loc.00948.005.jpg" type="reco"/>fever too, but they hope not dangerously so.</p>
            <p>We shall be glad to welcome you back, but while you are away I hope you will have a good time, &amp; get very well.</p>
            <p>Good by.</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>With love always</salute>
