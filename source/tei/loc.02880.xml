            <p>I see, my dearest Friend, I must not look for those dashes under the words I thought
                were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes. I see how the dark clouds
                linger. Full of pain &amp; indignation. I read the paragraph&#8212;but fuller still
                of yearning tenderness &amp; trust and hope. I believe my dear love that what you
                need to help on your recovery is a <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02880.002.jpg" type="verso"/> woman's tender cherishing love and care and that in that warm
                genial atmosphere the spring of life will be quickened once more and flow full and
                strong through all its channels as of old, gradually, not quickly, even so. I dare
                say: but with plenty of patience; with utmost intelligent care of all conditions
                favourable to health, of diet, of abundant oxygen in the rooms you inhabit, of as
                much <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02880.003.jpg" type="recto"/> outdoor life as
                possible, of happy cheerful companionship &amp; all the homely everyday domestic
                joys which are so healthful <!-- Harned had "helpful"? -al --> in their influences. </p>

            <p>America is doing what nations in all times have done towards that which is profoundly
                new &amp; great, that which discredits their old ideals and offers them strange
                fruits &amp; flowers from another world than that they have been content to <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02880.004.jpg" type="verso"/> dwell in all their
                lives. But for all that, I do not believe the precious seed is lying dormant even
                now&#8212;everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured &amp; yields a noble
                growth. Since it is America that has produced you nourished your soul and body, she
                is silently unnoticed producing men &amp; women who will justify you, who will
                understand the meaning of all and respond with <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02880.005.jpg" type="recto"/> a love that will quicken &amp; exalt
                humanity as Christ's influence once did. Still it is inscrutable to me that the
                heart of America is not now passionately drawn toward the great heart that beats
                &amp; glows in these Poems&#8212;that Drum Taps, at any rate are not as dear to her
                as the memory of her dead heroes sons brothers husbands. It must be that they really
                do not reach the hands of the American people at large&#8212;that the professedly
                literary cultivated class <pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02880.006.jpg" type="verso"/> asking for nothing better than the pretty sing song
                sentimentalities which "join them in their nonsense," or else slavishly prostrating
                their judgments before the models of the past (so perfect for their day, so wholly
                inadequate for ours) raise their voices so loud in news papers &amp; magazines as to
                prevent or everywhere check the circulation </p>

            <p><date when="1875-01-01">Jan. 1.</date> The New Year has come in bleakly &amp;
                keenly&#8212;to the inner as well as to the outer sense, with the papers full of the
                details of the dark fate of the emigrant ship &amp; of the terrible railway
                accidents.
                    Percy<!-- Formerly "Percys," which makes less sense and does not appear to be the case on the images. Does Harned have "Percys?" -JS --><!-- <ptr target="loc.02880_n1"/> --> was not able to join us at Xmas (through
                business,) but I am expecting him tonight. My mother bears up against the cold
                wonderfully&#8212;&amp; even continues to go out in her chair&#8212;so Bee's<!-- <ptr target="loc.02880_n2"/> --> letters are very bright
                &amp; cheerful&#8212;she &amp; indeed all my children enjoy the cold <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="loc.02880.008.jpg" type="verso"/> much provided they
                have plenty of outdoor exercise&#8212;above all skating, which they are now
                enjoying. I too like it, but am so haunted by the thought of the increased misery it
                brings to our hundreds of thousands of ill fed ill clothed ill housed.&#8212;I trust
                the family circle round you &amp; your nieces<!-- <ptr target="loc.02880_n3"/> --> at St. Louis, &amp; all near &amp; dear to you are well, and
                that you have felt the warm grasp of many loving friends this wintry cloudy time my
                dearest&#8212;and that there may breathe out of these poor words a warm bright glow
                of love and hope &amp; <supplied reason="illegible" source="Harned Transcription">unrestricted</supplied>
