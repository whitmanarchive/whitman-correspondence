            <p>I see, my dearest Friend, I must not look for those dashes<ptr target="loc.02880_n7"/> under 
                the words I thought were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes. I see how the dark 
                clouds linger. Full of pain &amp; indignation. I read the paragraph&#8212;but fuller still of 
                yearning tenderness &amp; trust and hope. I believe my dear love that what you need to help on 
                your recovery is a 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_cb.00280.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                woman's tender cherishing love and care and that in that warm genial atmosphere the spring 
                of life will be quickened once more and flow full and strong through all its channels as of 
                old, gradually, not quickly, even so. I dare say: but with plenty of patience; with utmost 
                intelligent care of all conditions favourable to health, of diet, of abundant oxygen in the 
                rooms you inhabit, of as much

                outdoor life as possible, of happy cheerful companionship &amp; all the homely everyday 
                domestic joys which are so healthful in their influences.</p>

            <p>America is doing what nations in all times have done towards that which is profoundly new 
                &amp; great, that which discredits their old ideals and offers them strange fruits &amp; 
                flowers from another world than that they have been content to 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_cb.00278.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                dwell in all their lives. But for all that, I do not believe the precious seed is lying 
                dormant even now&#8212;everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured &amp; yields a 
                noble growth. Since it is America that has produced you nourished your soul and body. She 
                is silently unnoticed producing men &amp; women who will justify you, who will understand 
                the meaning of all and respond with

                a love that will quicken &amp; exalt humanity as Christ's influence once did. Still it is 
                inscrutable to me that the heart of America is not now passionately drawn toward the great 
                heart that beats &amp; glows in these Poems&#8212;that Drum Taps,<ptr target="n0819"/> at 
                any rate are not as dear to her as the memory of her dead heroes sons brothers husbands. 
                It must be that they really do not reach the hands of the American people at large&#8212;that 
                the professedly literary cultivated class

                asking for nothing better than the pretty sing song sentimentalities which "join them in 
                their nonsense," or else slavishly prostrating their judgments before the models of the 
                past (so perfect for their day, so wholly inadequate for ours) raise their voices so loud 
                in news papers &amp; magazines as to prevent or everywhere check the circulation</p>

                the inner as well as to the outer sense, with the papers full of the details of the dark fate

                am expecting him tonight. My mother bears up against the cold wonderfully&#8212;&amp; even

                much provided they have plenty of outdoor exercise&#8212;above all skating, which they are 
                now enjoying. I too like it, but am so haunted by the thought of the increased misery it 
                brings to our hundreds of thousands of illfed illclothed illhoused.&#8212;I trust the family 
                circle round you &amp; your nieces<ptr target="loc.02880_n3"/> at St. Louis, &amp; all near
