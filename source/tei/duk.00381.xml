            </opener>
            <p>Well, I suppose you have the hot weather too&#8212;it has been very hot here for the last four or five days, but I have got along very well&#8212;I think of you every day, with the work &amp; the heat, &amp;c.&#8212;I believe you said that it was good air around there in Pacific st., well I should think that was one great advantage over Portland av. any how. Mother, I rec'd your letter of last week&#8212;I do not go much to the hospital this hot weather&#8212;I think I feel better than usual now for a couple of weeks past&#8212;if I can only get through the summer as well as I am, I shall be satisfied&#8212;Mrs. Grayson gives me plenty of good vegetables, peas, string beans, squash &amp; new potatoes, with fruit now &amp; then, which is better than too much meat&#8212;Old Mrs. Mix<ptr target="duk.00381_n1"/> is well as usual&#8212;the house is very pleasant this weather&#8212;as cool as it can be any where&#8212;</p>
            <p>I should like to hear from Han,<ptr target="duk.00381_n2"/> but I suppose she is getting along in the same old way&#8212;As I am writing this letter at my table, the celebrated Mrs. Cobb<ptr target="duk.00381_n3"/> has just come in, to see about some rebel pardon, some profitable job for her, I suppose&#8212;she is a great piece&#8212;she is what most people would call a very pretty little woman&#8212;dresses gay, &amp;c&#8212;but she has too brazen &amp; silly a way, ever to be taken for a lady by any one that knows&#8212;she has got lots of pardons, &amp; probably made a fortune&#8212;is half the time at the President's&#8212;is not a good character. This Washington is a great place&#8212;you see how funny the world is governed&#8212;&amp; lots of queer doings that outsiders never dream of&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, my new shirts are done, half a dozen, very satisfactory&#8212;I havn't bought any new clothes this summer except a new hat, a big brim, light drab&#8212;makes me look like a southern planter, but is very light &amp; comfortable&#8212;Mother, I wish you could sit here by the window I have so often mentioned, &amp; have the cool breeze blow on you, as it is now, &amp; the trees &amp; river &amp; hills beyond, so pleasant&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear mother, you must try to take things moderate&#8212;because folks that worry &amp; overdo are apt to get the cholera, you know&#8212;I hope brother Jeff feels all right again<ptr target="duk.00381_n4"/>&#8212;how I should like to see him, &amp; all of you.</p>
