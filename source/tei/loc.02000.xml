                months that I spent there in two installments.</p>
            <p>Oh! what a sad lesson I learned there of young America.</p>
            <p>A line in Leaves of Grass led me to think that you was the very man to get him out of
                the Scrape, or at least to show him his danger, of which he seemed quite ignorant.
                In the Asylum I saw "living bodys" that had been so sadly defiled by forcing <choice>

                this is greater madness. Could not the coming young America be induced to do this
                noblest work manfully &amp; womanly if benevolent liberals were to form themselves
                into a Society for the purpose of taking naked infants from their mothers bring them
                up naked, and marry them at the age of about eight years bringing all Science &amp;
