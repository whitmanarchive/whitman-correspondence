                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>For the first time in my life I heard of you last winter, and your wonderful
                    poetry although I will say your name was somewhat familiar&#8212;yet as I had
                    identified you with no memories or experiences, to me, you did not exist.</p>

                <p>I read "Some Personal &#38; old Age Memoranda"<ptr target="loc.01099_n3"/> the other
                    articles relating to you and the short poems published in Lippincott's Monthly
                    Magazine. That was my first acquaintance with you. It was also a <choice><sic>revalation</sic><corr>revelation</corr></choice>. All my life I have felt that real poetry did not depend on rhyme
                    metre <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01099.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01099.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> accent
                    &#38;c; that if all those qualities were there and the soul wanting we had a
                    skeleton grieving and ghastly that glided here and there in rhythmic motion yet
                    thrilled with disgust only.</p>

                <p>I have lately read "A Twilight Song" &#38; To the "Sunset Breeze."<ptr
                        target="loc.01099_n1"/></p>

                <p>That is all of yours I have ever read, just enough to whet my appetite.</p>

                <p>As soon as I can afford it I will have "Leaves of Grass." I want it badly but had
                    spent all my spare change before I knew I wanted it.</p>

                <p>I have written sometimes what seemed poetry to me but when I tried to put it in
                    regular harmonious order hoop it round like a barrel, as it were, the poetry was
                    all choked out and it fell flat and insipid from my hands.</p>

                <p>I have never offered any of it <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                        facs="loc.01099.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.01099.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> for
                    publication but have hidden it away or destroyed it. I was not brave as were you
                    and besides I am not great.</p>

                <p>Last week was Decoration Day<ptr target="loc.01099_n4"/> in Waco and I wrote one of my poems but did not
                    offer it to the committee nor for publication. Only one person, a sister, has
                    seen it, today I was looking at your portrait and I felt as if I wanted you to
                    read it.</p>

                <p>I do not expect any notice from you whatever in your infirmity &#38; present
                    state of health.</p>

                <p>It is only a harmless conceit of a working woman (I am a teacher) My husband was
                    a southern soldier &#38; is dead; it seemed as if it would be a sort of
                    satisfaction to me if I could think in my mind (["]Walt Whitman has read my
                    attempt at poetry")</p>

                <p>I do not believe you will misunderstand the sentiment although the lines may
                    provoke a smile.</p>
