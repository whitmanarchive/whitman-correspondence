                    Tennyson<ptr target="n0625"/> was still staying at Haslemere, I posted your

            <p>I received your welcome letter of October the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi><ptr
                    target="loc.02196_n3"/>&#8212;I rejoice that you and my friends at Glendale
                continue in such excellent health&#8212;I should indeed have enjoyed the drive with

            <p>It is foggy, smoky and dark this morning at the a.m. o.c. and I am scribbling this

                oxygen" as compared to this groggy London fog, alas. What a wonder it is that we are
