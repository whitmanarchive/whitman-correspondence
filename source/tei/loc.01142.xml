                <salute>Dear Walt.</salute>
                </opener>
            <p>I was much disturbed by your card. I had been thinking of you as probably enjoying these superb autumn days down in the country at Kirkwood, &amp; here you are wretched &amp; sick at home. I trust you are better now. You need a change. I dearly wish that as soon as you are well enough 
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01142.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                you would come up here &amp; spend a few weeks with us. We could have a good time here in my bark-covered shanty &amp; in knocking about the country. Let me know that you will come.</p>
            <p>The "Specimen Days &#38;c" came all right. I do not like the last part of the title; it brings me up with such a short turn. I have read most of the new matter &amp; like it of course. I have not seen any notices of the book yet. 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01142.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                I have just <choice><abbr>recd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> an English book&#8212;<hi rend="underline">Familiar Studies of men &amp; books</hi>&#8212;by Stevenson with an essay upon you in it. But it does not amount to much. He has the American vice of smartness &amp; flippancy. I do not think you would care for the piece.</p>
            <p>I am bank examining nowadays, but shall be free again pretty soon.</p>
            <p>O'Connor writes me that he is going to <choice><abbr>pub</abbr><expan>publish</expan></choice> his <hi rend="underline">Tribune</hi> letters in a pamphlet, with some other matter; I am glad to hear it. He draws blood every time.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01142.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I fear poor old Alcott will not rally; indeed he may be dead now. I had a pleasant letter from him the other day. I had sent him a crate of Concord grapes.</p>
            <p>I am very stupid to-day. For the past two weeks my head has been ground between the upper &amp; nether millstone of bank ledgers &amp; it is sore. We are all well. Julian is a fine large boy. Drop me a card when you receive this; also write me when you will come up.</p>
