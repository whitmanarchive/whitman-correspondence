      <p>Nothing new or particular<ptr target="duk.00664_n2"/>—I send you an "Appleton's
        Journal," with some good reading in it<ptr target="duk.00664_n3"/>—Well, mother, how
        are you all? Last night was a heavy rain here—I thought of your roof—the snow
        has all disappeared here—very pleasant yesterday indeed here—to-day the whole
        city looks all washed clean—</p>

      <p>I went to a concert Tuesday night—very good—I heard a singer, Mario<ptr target="n0381"/>, I heard 30 years ago—an old man, now—yet he sings first-rate
        yet—then Patti<ptr target="n0466"/>, a lady—&amp; others. It was in quite a fine hall here called
        Lincoln Hall<ptr target="duk.00664_n4"/>—I go there once in a while—(an editor
        of a newspaper here sends me spare tickets some times—that's how I go, most of the
        time.)</p>

      <p>I have got a letter from John Burroughs<ptr target="duk.00664_n5"/>—he is at
        Middletown, N. Y.—don't expect to return here permanently to live any more—but
        will return to pack up &amp; move—his wife is still here—I was up there a couple
        of evenings since—Mrs. B. is alone—has lately been vaccinated, &amp; is not very
        well—there has been a good deal of small pox here—all the clerks in the office
        have been vaccinated—Well, <choice>
          <orig>mamma</orig>
          <reg>mama</reg>
        </choice> dear, I believe I have scribbled down all the <hi rend="italic">small talk</hi> I
        can think of to amuse you for this time—Love to you, mother dear,</p>
