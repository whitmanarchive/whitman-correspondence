                    <note type="project" target="#rel01">Whitman repurposed the envelope in which Charles Eldridge sent this letter. Whitman opened the envelope
                    and used the inside as a sheet of writing paper; on this blank page he drafted the manuscript titled "Walt Whitman To-day." While this letter
                    is a part of The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., the envelope and the manuscript
                    are part of The Oscar Lion Papers, 1914–1955, New York Public Library, New York, N.Y. The envelope was identified as belonging to this letter based on the 
                    postmark that includes the city of "San Francisco, Cal." and the date of "Oct 8," 1889. The envelope also has "Treasury Deparment" and "U.S. Internal-Revenue"
                    printed on it, which was Eldridge's place of employment at the time, and the letter is written on "United States Internal Revenue" letterhead.</note>

            <p>Your postal card was duly received.—I got all your papers and very glad of them.
                Especially the Boston Transcripts, Critics, Liberty &amp;c—I am glad to see the
                notices of William<ptr target="n2002"/> that appear occasionally, but they give a
                very faint idea of the man to those who knew him best—If I had power of
                literary expression I would try to write something—If you had your health and
                strength I know you could give just the right touches which would preserve the
                portrait of an uncommonly gifted mind—John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/>
                might do it but he lacks sympathy I think with certain fiery and vivid types of
                which Wm. was a bright exemplar.—But perhaps it is just as well. "The silent
                organ loudest chants the masters requiem"<ptr target="loc.02029_n3"/>—</p>
            <p>I am going up and down this fair land and watching the vintage "from which streams of
                brandy do flow. By which I only mean that they are gathering and pressing

                vineyards—1000 acre vineyards not uncommon with five tons of grapes to the
                acre—and from the new wine brandy is largely distilled, we are in the height
                of brandy making season with which the internal revenue department is largely
                concerned—</p>
            <p>Saw your interview with Edwin Arnold<ptr target="n6163"/>
                and much touched by it.—The applause of other nations, if not your own, begins
                to be heard in your declining years. May every comfort and blessing gather around
                you as your steps grow slow brother beloved.—I hope to see you next year.</p>
