            <p>We have had cold &amp; spiteful weather all the time of my visit here—over a month—&amp; I have not had my usual outdoor enjoyment, loafing about &amp;c—have been indoors most of the time—I also caught cold just on coming here, &amp; it has bothered ever since.</p>

            <p>I have got out my new edition, from same plates as the last, only all bound in One Vol.—neatly done in green cloth, vellum—looks the best &amp; most ship-shape of any edition yet—have not added any of my later pieces in this—leaving them to some future issue—</p>
            
            <p>Rec'd a letter from Mrs. Gilchrist in England—she has been reading "Wake Robin" &amp; takes to it greatly<ptr target="nyp.00301_n4"/>—says Rossetti dined at her house not long since—(You know she is the authoress of the "Woman's Estimate," in the Radical)—</p>
                
            <p>John, I think it likely I shall return about the 1st of April—Mother has had a bad spell for three days, but is about as usual again, yesterday &amp; to-day—direct to me here—</p>
