            <p>Your letter &amp; George's came safe&#8212;dear brother George, one dont more than get a letter from him before you want to hear again, especially as things are looking pretty stormy down that way&#8212;but, mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in Kentucky at or near where George last wrote,<ptr target="loc.00794_n1"/> but of course that is only my guess&#8212;I send George papers often &amp; occasionally letters&#8212;mother, I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him, but I sent it&#8212;Mother, I think Rosecrans &amp; Burnside will be too much for the rebels down there yet&#8212;I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">such</hi> friends too&#8212;they will <hi rend="italic">fight</hi> &amp; fight up to the handle &amp; kill somebody&#8212;(it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, &amp; tell me about Andrew, if there is any thing different with him&#8212;I think about him every day &amp; night. I believe I must come home even if it is only for a week&#8212;I want to see you all very much&#8212;Mother, I know you must have a good deal to harrass &amp; trouble you, I dont mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, &amp; do any thing to nourish him, but about the children &amp; Nancy&#8212;but, mother, you must not let any thing chafe you, &amp; you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little Georgy<ptr target="loc.00794_n2"/> too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older) &amp; while you are pleasant with Nancy, you must be sufficiently plain with her&#8212;only, mother, I know you will &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat will too be <hi rend="italic">invariably</hi> good to Andrew, &amp; not mind his being irritable at times, it is his disease, &amp; then his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness, &amp; always do any thing for him that you can in reason&#8212;Mat, my dear sister, I know you will, for I know your nature is to come out a first class girl in times of trouble &amp; sickness, &amp; do any thing&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, you dont know how pleased I was to read what you wrote about little sis,<ptr target="loc.00794_n3"/> I want to see her so bad I dont know what to do, I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island&#8212;but I hope I will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt I hope has heart &amp; gizzard big enough for both his little neices, &amp; as many more as the Lord may send&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office as usual&#8212;I am all alone to-day&#8212;Major is still absent, unwell, &amp; the clerk is away somewhere&#8212;O how pleasant it is here, the weather I mean, &amp; other things too for that matter&#8212;I still occupy my little room 394 L st., get my own breakfast there, had good tea this morning, &amp; some nice biscuit, (yesterday morning &amp; day before had peaches cut up)&#8212;My friends the O'Connors that I wrote about re-commenced cooking the 1st of this month, (they have been as usual in summer taking their meals at a family hotel near by.) Saturday they sent for me to breakfast &amp; Sunday I eat dinner with them, very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes &amp;c. They are truly friends to me&#8212;I still get my dinner at a restaurant usually. I have a very good plain dinner, which is the only meal of any acc't I make during the day, but it is just as well, for I would be in danger of getting fat on the least encouragement, &amp; I have no ambition that way.</p>
            <p>Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, &amp; that things are upon the whole pleasant personally, for every day of my life I see enough to make one's heart ache with sympathy &amp; anguish here in the hospitals, &amp; I do not know as I could stand it, if it was not counterbalanced outside&#8212;it is curious&#8212;when I am present at the most appaling things, deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots), I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool&#8212;but often, hours afterward, perhaps when I am home, or out walking alone, I feel sick &amp; actually tremble, when I recal the thing &amp; have it in my mind again before me&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, did you see my letter in the N Y Times of Sunday Oct 4?<ptr target="loc.00794_n4"/> That was the long delayed letter&#8212;Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the Union with my letter in<ptr target="loc.00794_n5"/>&#8212;I wish very much he would do so yet, &amp; always when I have a letter in a paper I would like to have one sent&#8212;if you take the <hi rend="italic">Union</hi>, send me some once in a while&#8212;Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those? tell him if so I was much obliged, &amp; if he or Mr &amp; Mrs Brown<ptr target="loc.00794_n6"/> take any interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let 'em read the letters of course&#8212;O I must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence that I have cut my hair &amp; beard&#8212;since the event, Rosecrans, Charleston, &amp;c &amp;c have among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison&#8212;Jeff, my dearest brother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or three weeks past, will try [to] do it yet, so it will reach you for Sunday reading&#8212;so good bye, brother Jeff, &amp; good by for present, Mother dear, &amp; all, &amp; tell Andrew he must not be discouraged yet&#8212;</p>
