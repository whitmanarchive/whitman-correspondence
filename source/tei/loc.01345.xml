            <p>Your second letter (dated July 9) came an hour ago—welcomed, &amp; read twice
                already—the acc't of the Toynbee?<ptr target="loc.01345_n2"/> Hall doings
                &amp; chat deeply interesting to me—I think much of all genuine efforts of the
                human emotions, the soul &amp; bodily &amp; intellectual powers, to exploit
                themselves for humanity's good—the <hi rend="underline">efforts in
                    themselves</hi>, I mean (sometimes I am not sure but <hi rend="underline">they</hi> are the main matter)—without stopping to calculate whether the
                investment is tip-top in a business or statistical point of view. These libations,
                ecstatic life-pourings as it were of precious wine or <hi rend="underline">rose</hi>-<hi rend="underline">water</hi> on vast desert sands or great polluted river—taking
                chances for returns <hi rend="underline">or</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">no</hi>
                <hi rend="underline">returns</hi>—what were they (or are they) but the theory
                &amp; practice of the beautiful God Christ? or of all divine personality?</p>

            <p>We have had a week of furious hot weather here—&amp; are having it
                yet—(seems to have concentrated in &amp; around Philadelphia)—I keep
                pretty well, considering—dont go out at all till toward sundown, but get on
                the river two or three hours afterwards every even'g—I send in Phil. Press my
                last little piece<ptr target="loc.01345_n3"/>—you must chew upon it a
                little—my inward idea in it being the least literary or <hi rend="underline">poetical</hi>, &amp; most physiological &amp; scientific—</p>
            <p>My last letter from Dr. Bucke spoke of his going off with a sick friend &amp;
                relative to the Canadian Rockies, a jaunt of six or seven weeks—I have heard
                lately from John Burroughs—he has been writing quite a piece ab't Matthew
                Arnold, which I <choice><sic>tho't</sic><corr>thought</corr></choice> at first I w'd send you, but I believe I won't—as it is
                not very clear or encouraging—rather <hi rend="underline">dis</hi>couraging<ptr target="loc.01345_n4"/>—</p>

            <p>Ab't myself &amp; my own affairs there is nothing new or special to write, Mary dear.
                My house-lady Mrs. Davis continues to be in every respect (handiwork &amp;
                atmosphere) the very best and most acceptable that could have befallen me—Hot
                as it is, &amp; with several kind invitations away, I remain for the summer at my
                shanty in Mickle Street—upon the whole it is best for me—</p>
            <p>Mary, I hope your next letter will tell me of a visit to Mrs. Gilchrist—As I
                close it suggests itself to me that I prepare one of the big photos (the one with
                hand up to mouth) &amp; send you to give to the Toynbee? Hall folk—Love to you
                &amp; all</p>
