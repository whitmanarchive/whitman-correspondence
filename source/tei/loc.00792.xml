            <p>The noble gift of your brother Joseph P Davis<ptr target="loc.00792_n2"/> of [$20?] for the aid of the wounded, sick, dying soldiers
here came safe to hand—it is being sacredly distributed to
them—part of it has been so already—I may another time give
you special cases—I go every day or night in the hospitals a few
hours—<ptr target="loc.00792_n100"/>
         </p>
            <p>As to physical comforts, I attempt to have something—generally
a lot of—something harmless &amp; not too expensive to go round to
each man, even if it is nothing but a good home-made biscuit to each
man, or a couple of spoonfuls of blackberry preserve, I take a ward or
two of an evening &amp; two more next evening &amp;c—as an
addition to his supper—sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
(judgment of course has to be carefully used)—then, after such
general round, I fall back upon the main thing, after all, the special
cases, alas, too common—those that need special attention, some
little delicacy, some trifle—very often, far above all else,
soothing kindness wanted—personal magnetism—poor boys, their
sick hearts &amp; wearied &amp; exhausted bodies hunger for the
sustenance of love or their deprest spirits must be cheered up—I
find often young men, some hardly more than children in age yet—so
good, so sweet, so brave, so decorous, I could not feel them nearer to
me if my own sons or young brothers—Some cases even I could not
tell any one, how near to me, from their yearning ways &amp; their
sufferings—it is comfort &amp; delight to me to minister to them,
to sit by them—some so wind themselves around one's heart, &amp;
will be kissed at parting at night just like children—though
veterans of two years of battles &amp; camp life—</p>
            <p>I always carry a haversack with some articles most
wanted—physical comforts are a sort of basis—I distribute
nice large biscuit, sweet-crackers, sometimes cut up a lot of peaches
with sugar, give preserves of all kinds, jellies, &amp;c. tea, oysters,
butter, condensed milk, plugs of tobacco, (I am the only one that doles
out this last, &amp; the men have grown to look to me)—wine,
brandy, sugar, pickles, letter-stamps, envelopes &amp; note-paper, the
morning papers, common handkerchiefs &amp; napkins, undershirts, socks,
dressing gowns, &amp; fifty other things<ptr target="loc.00792_n3"/>—I have lots of special little requests. Frequently I
give small sums of money—shall do so with your brother's
contribution—the wounded are very frequently brought &amp; lay
here a long while without a cent. I have been here &amp; in front 9
months doing this thing, &amp; have learned much—two-thirds of the
soldiers are from 15 to 25 or 6 years of age—lads of 15 or 16 more
frequent than you have any idea—seven-eighths of the Army are
Americans, our own stock—the foreign element in the army is much
overrated, &amp; is of not much account anyhow—As to these
hospitals, (there are dozens of them in [&amp;] around Washington)
[there] are no hospitals you must understand like the diseased
half-foreign collections under that name common at all times in
cities—in these here, the noblest, cleanest stock I think of the
world, &amp; the most precious.<ptr target="loc.00792_n4"/>
