                <salute>My dear Walt Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have received from you lately "The Conservator" with Bucke's<ptr target="n0119"/>
                little article<ptr target="loc.02099_n2"/>, a newspaper with a review of my Keats,
                your letter of 22 May<ptr target="loc.02099_n3"/>, and the parcel by
                express&#8212;for all of which I thank you heartily. Your letter came on Monday the
                2nd; &#38; curiously I was going that evening to hear a paper about you read by a
                lady to some thirty or forty people, mostly ladies.<ptr target="loc.02099_n4"/>
                After the paper, which was very sympathetic &#38; intelligently done, I read the
                people your letter and the poem you enclosed. The poem was greatly liked; and the
                message to "British friends" fitted several. I have sent that to the Athenaeum, so
                that all may know how you are going on. The contents of the parcel are delightful
                and will be always prized by me&#38;I mean the photographs and the books in which
                you have written. It seems to me you have sent me, duplicates</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02099.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>and all, a great deal for the money. I will let you know the cost of expressage,
                because I presume you wish to keep a check on the agents&#8212;it was 7/6 (not very
                dear, I think)&#8212;but this is of course my affair; for I make the parcel out to
                come to a good bit over 5..7..6 even in money; and there is much that money will not
                pay for.</p>

            <p>Quite by chance I have just taken up at a stall the last part of a serial issue of a
                book called "Celebrities of the Century."<ptr target="loc.02099_n5"/> The book was
                issued complete a year or two ago. I contributed the notice of you &#38; several
                others on the distinct understanding that I should say what I pleased. Now they have
                made this reissue without my knowledge, &#38; the conclusion of the article on you
                has been chopped off. I send you the thing as it is now, becuase it may amuse you to
                know what an eminently <hi rend="underline">respectable</hi> form will publish about
                you in the year 1890. They would not have cut off the end, I fancy, except to make
                room for something else; for they published</p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02099.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>it all right in the book, which did not contain the notice on the next page, of Sir
                J. Whitworth.</p>

            <p>Since receiving your parcel I have heard of something else that I want. It is
                described as "The Family Edition of Specimen Days and Collect,<ptr
                    target="loc.02099_n6"/>&#8212;a few copies said to have been extra-illustrated
                &#38; extended in some way. If you had one left I would think it a great favor to be
                allowed to buy it. You might put my name in it &#38; just send a line on a postcard
                to let me know the cost. Some of those photographs you have sent me are really
                splendid&#8212;what a fortunate atmosphere! English photographs don't have half the
                sharpness &#38; detail.</p>
