            </opener>

            <p>I received your welcome letter, and was happy to know that you had not forgotten me—for I have thought of you many times since. I returned here from New York about four weeks ago, 
                and have been and now am working in this office as usual—am well and hearty, 
                and don't hurt myself with hard work. Our hours are from 9 till 3.
            </p>
            
            <p>You speak of coming here and paying me a visit. Dear boy, I hope you will come truly, 
                for it would be a great comfort to me if we could be together again. I don't know whether 
                it would be very pleasant to you here, Jack, for this is a stupid place compared to New York—but we would have each other's society, and that would be first rate.
            </p>
            
            <p>There's not much excitement in Washington—at least none that I take any interest in. 
                Politics and politicians carry the day here—but I meddle with them very little. 
                In a couple of weeks more, Congress will meet, and then the city will be quite lively.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am out a good deal in the open air, as I have plenty of leisure time. 
                It is fine scenery around Washington—plenty of hills, and a noble river. 
                I take a ride on the cars out to Georgetown west, or Navy Yard east, once in a while 
                of a pleasant afternoon, or Sunday—but I tell you I miss New York. 
                We had a long spell of splendid weather. But now it is colder, with some 
                snow a couple of days since. Jack, you must write often as you can—anything from my loving boy will be welcome—you needn't be particular about the writing—you might write in the car with pencil, when you have any time. I will write to you too. 
                I will now close for this time. Dear Jack, I send you my love.
            </p>
