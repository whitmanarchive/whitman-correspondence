            <p>Your kind pc of Oct. 3rd '91<ptr target="loc.02523_n1"/> reached me today
                along with two good letters from Horace<ptr target="n4267"/> full to the brim &#38; running over with&#8212;well with 
                himself for surely he is <hi rend="underline">sui generis</hi><ptr target="loc.02523_n2"/> &#38; I bless the day that brought me within the circle
                of friendship &#38; community with him.</p> 
            <p>My best thoughts to you for your p.c. &#38; for its
                affectionate message
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02523.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> 
                to Fred Wild<ptr target="loc.04694_n2"/> which I will convey to him at once.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to hear that you are again having "bad times" &#38; I sincerely hope that by this time your 
                bad spell will have again passed
                off or at any rate moderated so as to leave you in comparative comfort</p>
            <p>We dont quite know where J.W.W.<ptr target="n6121"/> is at present but we shall be hearing shortly I daresay.<ptr target="loc.02518_n2"/></p><p>
                Many thanks to you for sending off the

                L. of G. to Humphreys<ptr target="loc.02495_n2"/> 
                I have not yet heard of its arrival but will let you know, as doubtless H. himself will, when he receives it.</p>
            <p>We have had a terrible storm here &#38; are just getting thro it. The papers tell of great damage done both on land &#38; sea. This 
                morning was one of drenching rain but the afternoon cleared
                up &#38; the good sun smiled again upon the grimy town. Alas that it is so grimy! Truly God made the 
                country and man the town!</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02523.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>We shall all be glad to see J.W.W. again but we hope he will not hurry away from you this time &#38; we are 
            anxious that he shd stay as long as possible for his health's sake. He seems in good spirits &#38; 
            is having a real good time all through</p>
            <p>With kindest regard to all your house &#38; with best love to yourself</p>
