            <p>Your card of 2nd<ptr target="loc.07353_n2"/> came to hand yesterday morning.
                    Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/> was here and I showed it to him. He left by 11.30
                a.m. train for the west. I took him to the station and saw him off. He could only
                stay with me from Wednesday evening to Saturday morning&#8212;a short visit but I
                was glad to have him&#8212;would have been more glad if he could have stayed longer.
                We had some good talks and altogether a real good time. I wish you could get the
                little "annex" out at once&#8212;I want much to see it but suppose it cannot be
                issued untill Lippencott gets the poems printed that he has.<ptr target="loc.07353_n3"/></p>

            <p>It is sunny, warm (not hot) and pleasant here. The place tooks well and all is going
                quietly and well with us.</p>

            <p>My brother Eustace<ptr target="loc.07351_n3"/> (who you will remember)&#8212;we call
                him Duke&#8212;arrived here at noon today from Ottawa we have spent a few pleasant
                hours together this afternoon</p>
