            <p>&#8212;I have been away now over three months&#8212;was down on Long Island last July
                &#38; August and then for the last two months have been in Boston, seeing to the
                printing of my complete poems "Leaves of Grass" in one volume&#8212;which is all
                done to my satisfaction, &#38; the book will be published now in about a week. I
                came back from Boston last Saturday, &#38; expect to stay in New York ten or twelve
                days, &#38; then back to Camden for a while. I got a letter from Harry six or seven
