            <p>I got your letter of last Thursday&#8212;I wrote to Han<ptr target="nyp.00209_n1"/> two or three days ago&#8212;poor Mrs. Mix<ptr target="nyp.00209_n2"/> is very bad&#8212;she has her old complaint neuralgia&#8212;she suffers very much indeed&#8212;it makes me almost sick, some spells she has, the agony is terrible, &amp; her screams are heartrending&#8212;fortunately her nights are comparatively easy&#8212;it is doubtful if she recovers&#8212;</p>
            <p>We are having delightful weather&#8212;just right&#8212;I went to the Post Hospital<ptr target="nyp.00209_n3"/> yesterday, Sunday, &amp; who do you think was one of the first persons I found there&#8212;Jo. Velsor,<ptr target="nyp.00209_n4"/> poor fellow, he has had jaundice pretty bad, but is now getting very near well&#8212;so he goes out &amp; around&#8212;he expects to go to work again in a day or two&#8212;he has work in the Quartermasters Dept. driving an ambulance&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I suppose you got the letter Saturday last with the envelopes&#8212;</p>
            <p>I hope you have as pleasant weather in Brooklyn as we have had here for a week past, &amp; now&#8212;</p>
            <p>It is generally expected Congress will adjourn the last of this month, &amp; then there will be some high old times in politics &amp; the Departments&#8212;most of us think that A[ndrew] J[ohnson] is only waiting for that, to lay around him &amp; kick up his heels at a great rate. Well, we shall see what comes to pass&#8212;but I guess the Republicans are just every bit as ferocious as he is&#8212;they won't back down an inch&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, the small bills I send you, you might distribute, (or get some fire crackers or something,) for Ed,<ptr target="nyp.00209_n5"/> &amp; Jimmy &amp; George<ptr target="nyp.00209_n6"/>&#8212;not forgetting Hat &amp; sis<ptr target="nyp.00209_n7"/>&#8212;</p>
