                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>A few lines to you before going out.—A better morning than yesterday &amp; rather
            promising.</p>
            <p>I went to N.Y. yesterday afternoon<ptr target="loc.04403_n2"/> &amp; took a car to Union Square. Johnston<ptr target="n0336"/> was just leaving
            the shop when I arrived, on a pressing business engagement, but gave me a most cordial reception,
            invited me to come again today &amp; introduced me to his daughter May.<ptr target="loc.04403_n4"/></p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.01016_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I talked with her for 10 or 15 minutes, &amp; was very much pleased with the cordial affectionate
            way in which she spoke of "uncle Walt." Only that morning she said, her youngest brother (aged 9)<ptr target="loc.04403_n3"/> had
            been asking to be taken soon to see uncle Walt. And it was very evident from her whole speech
            &amp; manner that they all regard you with genuine human affection. And when I left she commissioned
            me to give her best love to you.</p>
            <p>I then went to Walker St. to see Williamson<ptr target="n4993"/> &amp; spent 15 minutes with him. He is
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.01017_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            living out of town just now &amp; had a train to catch. But he was as friendly as could be &amp; seemed
            pleased to hear about you. I quite enjoyed my short interview with him. Looks well &amp; in good spirits.</p>
            <p>Am going out shortly to see Bush.<ptr target="loc.04403_n5"/> Rome<ptr target="loc.04931_n2"/> is
            arranging to have the afternoon with me, &amp; we will go to New York together &amp; call on Johnston.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more quietly &amp; genuinely <hi rend="underline">homely</hi>, more considerate &amp; gentle
            in its kindness than my reception &amp; treatment here</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.01018_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I like them all very much indeed, &amp; consider it a privilege to know them. It is quite moving
             &amp; pathetic to me at times to see the wistful look (as of a feeling deep &amp; inarticulate) that comes into
             Rome's face when we talk of you.</p>
            <p>But I trust that we shall both see you for a short time tomorrow. (Don't know yet what time we shall arrive.
             But we will go to Traubel's<ptr target="n4267"/> first—perhaps about 11.30 there.)</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Love to you always, &amp; best prayers &amp; wishes</salute>
