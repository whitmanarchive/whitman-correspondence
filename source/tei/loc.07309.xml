                You will know before this that I got the papers (with account of banquet<ptr
                    target="med.00874_n3"/>) but if you send another set (not to hand yet) it is no
                harm. Yes,of course I have the pocket book L. of G.<ptr target="loc.07306_n1"/> and
                am never tired of handling it and admiring it&#8212;it is the lovelist little book I
                ever saw and now that the last corrections are made it is I suppose abt perfect as a
                piece of printing. I like the paper much, it has a good dead surface and tho' the
                ink shows through a little it does not obscure the reading any to hurt. Please do
                not forget to send me a copy (no doubt you have some printed as usual, a better yet
                if it would not be too much trouble to write of out for me&#8212;I should value an
                M.S. copy to no end) of "Voice from Death" What a fearful catastrophe!<ptr
                    target="med.00874_n4"/> America has never seen the like and I trust never will

            <p>poem&#8212;or for a chapter in some great prose work! But it seems a sin to think of
                it that way&#8212;it is too awful&#8212;the hundreds of little children and women
                overwhelmed and suffocated in a moment. The great ship wrecks sink into
                insignificance before the honor of it. I have written Harned<ptr target="n4146"/> to
                put me down for $5. worth of the banquet book or pamphlet&#8212;guess it will be
                quite an interesting contribution to the great heap of W.W. literature.<ptr

                meter&#8212;I guess all is going well but it goes mighty slow. All well here. Rain, rain,
                rain&#8212;has rained now for near a month and still keeps on&#8212;raining quite
                hard the present moment (11.40 a.m.).</p>
