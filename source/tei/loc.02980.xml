                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Thank you for papers sent, &amp; for all loving thought. I hope you are "holding your
                own."</p>

            <p>I must have gained a little here, for I sleep more, and have a better appetite. I am
                going to be weighed, I weighed 95 the day before I left Washington.<pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02980.002.jpg" type="verso"/> I write now especially
                to tell you that I intend to leave here next Monday, Sept. 16, unless a storm should
                present. We have to go to Eastport 12 miles by wagon, &amp; then take steamer to
                Boston. If it is stormy, Mrs. <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#ktl"
                    >Porter</unclear> says we must take the next boat, that would be Sept. 18,
                Wednesday. But in any case after you get this letter, my address<pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02980.003.jpg" type="recto"/> will be care of my
                nephew in Boston which I will give in a separate slip. I shall make a few short
                stops with nieces &amp; <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="5"/> till I
                return home, &amp; as my nephew is a fixture, he will forward any thing to me
                wherever I am. I shall not go home till into October I think. We have had such a wet
                &amp; rainy summer there that I know I better wait a while. I <hi rend="underline"
                    >dread</hi>, dear Walt, I can't tell any<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02980.004.jpg" type="verso"/> one how much I dread the going back
                home. I say <hi rend="underline">home</hi>, but the sense of loneliness that
                overtakes me when I think of going is heart-sickening. And the uncertainty of all
                adds to it. If I were sure that I could make any arrangement to keep a home, I
                should feel better, but all is as cloudy &amp; misty. But I try to keep up a good
                heart, &amp; not to worry my friends with my troubles.</p>



            <p>I have one hope that I am clinging to, and that is that my sister Mrs. Channing
                    may<pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02980.005.jpg" type="recto"/> come on. She
                has not been East since they went to Cal. five years next month, &amp; she wants to
                come if their finances will allow, &amp; it will be the greatest comfort &amp; help
                to me, as she can advise me better than any one, what to do, &amp; help me about
                disposing of William's<ptr target="n2002"/> papers &amp; c. He left all to me
                absolutely, but I should be so glad of help in many matters, &amp; wish I had any
                one near at hand who could advise with me.</p>
            <p>Do you think there is<pb xml:id="leaf003v" facs="loc.02980.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                any <hi rend="underline">good</hi> picture of William: one that you really like?
                Appleton has sent for me for the Encyclopedia, &amp; I have not the one that I like
                best here with me, &amp; the <hi rend="underline">best</hi> of the late ones is not
                to <hi rend="underline">my</hi> mind. How do you like the one in "The Great
                    Cryptogram?"<ptr target="loc.07491_n1"/></p>
            <p>Thanks for the papers. Critic came yesterday with the Hawthorne letters. I was glad
                to see them.</p>
            <p>You will see what a remote place this is, &amp; how<pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc.02980.007.jpg" type="recto"/> protected the shore when I tell you that
                the heavy sea of last Sunday &amp; Monday did not reach us. It is the only seashore
                place that I ever touched where there is never any surf.</p>
            <p>Good by.</p>
            <p>I send my address on the enclosed slip.</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>I have a picture of William taken long ago that I like <hi rend="underline">very
                        much</hi> but would it be as satisfactory to the friends generally as the
                    later ones, taken from years ago?</p>
                <p>If you are able to write, I should like your thought in this matter.</p>
