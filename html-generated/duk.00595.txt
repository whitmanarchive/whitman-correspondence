                My dear Walter
            
            
            i
                did feel so ansious anxious to hear
                from you and i cant can't help but feel quite
                down hearted to hear your thumb is so bad
            yet i am so sorry for you to have
            such a tedious long time but i hope you
            will have it all come right in time but it
                seemes seems a long time it seemes seems sometimes as
            if a sore never will get well and then at
            other times it will heal very quick it is
            too bad)
            how doo do you do to write at the
                office or dontdon't you
                i wish you could
            write what the doctor thinks of it and
            what you put on it but i dont don't want 
            to have you write any extras because i
            know by the writing it must be difficult
            for you i long for a letter so bad thinking
            you will be better the next one

            get well) i had a letter from Jeff
