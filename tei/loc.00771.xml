               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I received a letter from Heyde this morning, one of the usual sort, about as interesting as a dose of salts. Says Han has not been able to stand erect for the past five months&#8212;the doctor told her lately that she might possibly recover in one year if she was careful&#8212;then says he thinks, &amp; he don't think, &amp; has taken a little place, &amp; Han has a girl to wait on her, &amp;c. &amp;c. All amounts to nothing more than we knew before, &amp; only serves to make one feel almost heart-sick about Han, &amp; the awful snarl in which we are all fixed about it all, &amp; what to do. I wrote to Han yesterday, (before I received this letter of Heyde's), I wrote a short letter of my own, &amp; sent her George's letter to you, (I cut out what was said about the money, as I did not wish Heyde to see it.)<ptr target="loc.00771_n1"/>
            </p>
            <p>I also sent George a letter yesterday&#8212;have not got any letter myself from Georgy, but have sent him quite a good many &amp; papers&#8212;Mother, what a tramp the 51st has had&#8212;they only need now to go to California, &amp; they will finish the job complete&#8212;</p>
            <p>O mother, how welcome the shirts were&#8212;I was putting off, &amp; putting off, to get some new ones, I could not find any one to do them as I wear them, &amp; it would have cost such a price&#8212;&amp; so my old ones had got to be, when they come back from the wash I had to laugh, they were a lot of rags, held together with starch&#8212;I have a very nice old black aunty for a washwoman, but she bears down pretty hard I guess when she irons them, &amp; they showed something like the poor old city of Fredericksburgh does, since Burnside bombarded it&#8212;Well, mother, when the bundle came, I was so glad&#8212;&amp; the coats too, worn as they are, they come in very handy&#8212;&amp; the cake, dear mother, I am almost like the boy that put it under his pillow&#8212;&amp; woke up in the night &amp; eat some&#8212;I carried a good chunk to a young man wounded, I think a good deal of, &amp; it did him so much good&#8212;it is dry, but all the better, as he eat it with tea &amp; it relished&#8212;I eat a piece with him &amp; drinked some tea, out of his cup, as I sat by the side of his cot&#8212;Mother, I have neglected I think what I ought to have told you two or three weeks ago, that is that I had to discard my old clothes, somewhat because they were too thick &amp; more still because they were worse gone in than any I ever yet wore I think in my life, especially the trowsers&#8212;wearing my big boots had caused the inside of the legs just above the knee to wear two beautiful round holes right through cloth &amp; partly through the lining, producing a novel effect, which was not necessary, as I produce a sufficient sensation without&#8212;then they were desperately faded&#8212;I have a nice plain suit, of a dark wine color, looks very well, &amp; feels good, single breasted sack coat with breast pockets &amp;c. &amp; vest &amp; pants same as what I always wear, (pants pretty full,) so upon the whole all looks unusually good for me, my hat is very good yet, boots ditto, have a new necktie, nice shirts, you can imagine I cut quite a swell&#8212;I have not trimmed my beard since I left home, but it is not grown much longer, only perhaps a little bushier&#8212;I keep about as stout as ever, &amp; the past five or six days I have felt wonderful well, indeed never did I feel better&#8212;about ten or twelve days ago, we had a short spell of very warm weather here, but for about six days now it has been delightful, just warm enough.</p>
            <p>I generally go to the hospitals from 12 to 4&#8212;&amp; then again from 6 to 9&#8212;some days I only go either in the middle of the day, or evening, not both&#8212;&amp; then when I feel somewhat opprest, I skip over a day, or make perhaps a light call only, as I have received several cautions from the doctors, who tell me that one must beware of continuing too steady &amp; long in the air &amp; influences of the hospitals&#8212;I find the caution a wise one.</p>
            <p>Mother, you or Jeff must write me what Andrew does about going to North Carolina<ptr target="loc.00771_n2"/>&#8212;I should think it might have a beneficial effect upon his throat.</p>
            <p>I wrote Jeff quite a long letter Sunday<ptr target="loc.00771_n3"/>&#8212;Jeff must write to me whenever he can, I like dearly to have them, &amp; whenever you feel like it you too, dear mother&#8212;tell sis her uncle Walt will come back one of these days from the sick soldiers &amp; take her out on Fort Greene again&#8212;Mother, I received a letter yesterday from John Elliott's<ptr target="loc.00771_n4"/> father, in Bedford co[unty,] Pennsylvania, (the young man I told you about, who died under the operation)&#8212;it was very sad, it was the first he knew about it&#8212;I don't know whether I told you of Dennis Barnett,<ptr target="loc.00771_n5"/> pneumonia, three weeks since, had got well enough to be sent home&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dearest mother, I hope you will take things as easy as possible &amp; try to keep a good heart&#8212;Matty, my dear sister, I have to inform you that I was treated to a splendid dish of ice cream Sunday night, I wished you was with me to have another&#8212;I send you my love, dear sister. Mother, I hope by all means it will be possible to keep the money whole, to get some ranch next spring, if not before, I mean to come home &amp; build it.<ptr target="loc.00771_n6"/> Good bye for the present, dear mother.</p>
