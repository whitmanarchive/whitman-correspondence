            <p>I thought I would write a few lines to you and let you know how I am. I cannot get you off my mind somehow. I heard something that made me feel bad, and I saw that you did not want to bid me good bye when you went away yesterday. I will tell you what it was. I heard that you was going to Washington and stay and be <choice><orig>gon</orig><reg>gone</reg></choice> <choice><sic>fore</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> some time, is it so? I thought it was very strange in you, in not saying

            anything to me about it. I think of it all the time, I cannot get my mind on my work the best I can do. I should like to come up to Camden next week, and stay all night with you if I could, but I suppose I <choice><orig>can not</orig><reg>cannot</reg></choice> do it. I wish you would write to me soon and let me know how you are. Things are <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> dull down <hi rend="underline">here</hi> <choice><orig>to day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice>, there isn't any Excursion <choice><orig>to day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice> and It is <hi rend="underline">quiet</hi> and I don't like it very well. There was an Excursion here

            yesterday, it was given by a <hi rend="underline">rich</hi> man of <choice><abbr>Philadel.</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice> to the poor children of the ward in which he lived, there was over 200 on it. They appeared to enjoy it <choice><sic>verry</sic><corr>very</corr></choice> well. I was up there in the afternoon a little while. Mother<ptr target="n1039"/> got home all safe last night, she was home when I got there. Perhaps I will be up Wednesday night in the 6 train, I will if I can, if I do I will have to come back on the <choice><sic>Earley</sic><corr>Early</corr></choice> train in the morning so I will be in time to help Mr.

We have been trying to kill them but seems to me the more we kill of them the more we have. Mr. Sharp got out of patience in trying so he took the <hi rend="underline">poison</hi> out this morning. I have got to scrub the office out <hi rend="underline">this afternoon</hi>, so you can <choice><sic>imagin</sic><corr>imagine</corr></choice> me down on the floor.
