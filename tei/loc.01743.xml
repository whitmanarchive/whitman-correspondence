                <salute>Dear son,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I am only able to write the same old story&#8212;since I last wrote, I have had some
                pretty bad spells&#8212;suffered at intervals all last week, &amp; yesterday, with
                the strange &amp; painful distress in the head, I have had so much of&#8212;But I
                feel better to-day&#8212;Every time I feel better, I find myself much
                encouraged&#8212;I still stick here, as I <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> dare to trust myself in a strange place, if I can help it. </p>

            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01743.002.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>I rec'd your letter telling me you was too late to get any chance for the letter
                carrier's position&#8212;&amp; about Mr. Noyes' friendliness&#8212;Are things just the same, as far as
                you and your crew, are concerned?&#8212;I think about you every night&#8212;I reproach
                myself, that I did not fly around when I was well, &amp; in Washington, to find some
                better employment for you&#8212;now I am here, crippled, laid up for God knows how
                long, unable to help myself, or my dear boy&#8212;I do not miss any thing of
                Washington here, but <hi rend="underline">your visits</hi>&#8212;if I could only have a
                daily visit here, such as I had there&#8212;</p>
            
            
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01743.003.jpg" type="recto"/>

            <p>I go out very little here&#8212;there is not much convenience here, for me to go
                out&#8212;one car line, passing about two squares off, consists of 4 cars, running
                semi-occasionally&#8212;and another line, about 3½ squares the other way, has
                I believe 6 or 7 cars&#8212;I get out &amp; take a ride in them sometimes&#8212;my
                best jaunt is going in them to the ferry, &amp; crossing on the boat to
                Philadelphia, to &amp; fro, several times&#8212;But a great portion of the time I do
                not feel able to go out alone&#8212;fortunately I do not have any dizzy spells, nor
                any symptoms of them, so far,&#8212;so I am not worried about that, when I <hi rend="underline">am</hi> out&#8212;As I write this, it is a very pleasant cool
                    afternoon, &amp; I am sitting here by the window in a big easy chair</p>
            
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01743.004.jpg" type="verso"/>

            <p>Pete I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good spirits&#8212;Write me a
                good long letter, &amp; tell me every thing&#8212;it will do you good&#8212;&#8212;how does
                the new time go on the road, since Baltimore tunnel connection?&#8212;how about
                Washington&#8212;Tasistro&#8212;everybody?&#8212;get a good sheet of paper, &amp;
                sit down in the park, with your lead pencil&#8212;I send you an envelope&#8212;also
                some one cent stamps&#8212;</p>

            <p>&#8212;Love to you dear boy&#8212;Keep up a good heart&#8212;I do yet&#8212;though it is a
                long &amp; hard pull sometimes with me lately. </p>
