        <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> your letter yesterday, and was particularly pleased to get it, bringing late 
        intelligence about you all. It was a good letter. What you say about William, fagged 
        with work &amp; I suppose the weather&#8212;&amp; Nelly, half-sick, &amp; Jennie about the same (but 
        she will soon spring up)&#8212;aroused my sympathies&#8212;Mother &amp; I talked about them all&#8212;I send love to all. Nelly, I shall return next week, &amp; then I shall surely come to 
        the house, &amp; see you &amp; all.
      </p>
      
      <p>Charley, I went leisurely up the Connecticut valley, by way of Springfield, through 
        the best part (agriculturally, &amp; other) of Massachusetts, Connecticut &amp; New Hampshire, 
        June 24th &amp; 25th by day light&#8212;26th &amp; 27th at Hanover, N.H.&#8212;28th &amp; 29th slowly up the 
        White River valley, a captivating wild region, by Vermont Central R.R. &amp; so to Burlington, 
        &amp; about Lake Champlain where I spent a week, filling myself every day, (especially mornings 
        &amp; sunsets) with the grandest ensembles of the Adirondacks always on one side, and the Green 
        Mountains on the other&#8212;sailed after that down Champlain by day&#8212;<choice><orig status="unremarkable">stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice> at Albany over night, 
        &amp; down the Hudson by boat, 4th of July, through a succession of splendid &amp; magnificent 
        thunderstorms (10 or 12 of them) alternated by spells of clearest sunlight&#8212;Then home 
        some five or six days&#8212;immediately following I was ill, real ill&#8212;I suppose the excessive 
        heat, &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;but am now feeling all right.
      </p>
      
      <p>Upon the whole, I have stood the unprecedented heat pretty well. Mother is not very well&#8212;has spells of weakness&#8212;has rheumatism&#8212;then good days again&#8212;will break up from Brooklyn 
        in September, &amp; go with George, at Camden&#8212;as they are vehement for it.
      </p>
      
      <p>My sister Martha at St. Louis is better far than one would expect, after the alarm 
        of two months ago<ptr target="prc.00026_n1"/>&#8212;she has since no trouble with the cancer, (or supposed cancer)&#8212;Jeff &amp; the children well&#8212;My sister Hannah, (Mrs Heyde,) in Burlington, I found 
        better than I had anticipated&#8212;<hi rend="italic">every thing much better</hi><ptr target="prc.00026_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Charley, who do you think I have been spending some three hours with to-day, 
        from 12 to 3&#8212;(it is now 4½)&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Joaquin Miller</hi><ptr target="prc.00026_n3"/>&#8212;He saw me yesterday toward dusk 
        at 5th av. on a stage, &amp; rushed out of the house, &amp; mounting the stage gave me his address, 
        &amp; made an appointment&#8212;he lives here 34th st. in furnished rooms&#8212;I am much pleased, 
        (upon the whole) with him&#8212;<hi rend="italic">really pleased &amp; satisfied</hi>&#8212;<hi rend="italic">his presence, conversation, atmosphere</hi>, are infinitely more 
        satisfying than his poetry&#8212;he is, however, mopish, 
        <choice><sic>ennuyeed</sic><corr>ennuied</corr></choice>, a <hi rend="italic">California Hamlet</hi>, unhappy every where&#8212;but a natural prince, may-be an 
        illiterate one&#8212;but tender, sweet, &amp; magnetic&#8212;Love to you, dear Charley, &amp; to all&#8212;I will soon be with you again&#8212;</p>
