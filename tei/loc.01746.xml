                <salute>Dear son,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter is rec'd to-day, and enclosed I send you $20&#8212;I want you to write soon&#8212;as I shall want to know if it reached you safe.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am feeling relieved of the worst distress in the head, now for the last two days&#8212;had it straight along bad enough the first three days in the week&#8212;but yesterday 
                &amp; to-day it has mostly let up&#8212;have been out to-day, &amp; over to Philadelphia&#8212;it is hard work, especially as I have no one to go with me&#8212;but I put a bold face on, 
                <hi rend="underline">&amp; my best foot foremost</hi>&#8212;Is Wash Milburn there in the store? or has he gone on his vacation 
                in the country?&#8212;answer me in your next&#8212;I think of writing a few lines to him&#8212;Hot weather here, but I don't suffer much from it&#8212;though I think it is bad for me, 
                &amp; I hope much more from the cool season, if I get through this&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Pete I too see quite a good deal of <hi rend="underline">Railroad</hi>, &amp; hear more&#8212;some 70 rods off 
                is the great depot of the Camden &amp; Amboy, bells &amp; whistles &amp; trains rumbling continually, 
                night &amp; day, &amp; lots of RR men living near, around here&#8212;if I only felt just <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01746.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                a little better, 
                I should get acquainted with many of the men, which I could very easily do if I would
                I should like much to go on the trips so handy &amp; cheap, right as you might say from my door, 
                to Cape May, or to Long Branch, &amp;c. to say nothing of the numerous fine jaunts 
                from Philadelphia by RR. or up or down the Delaware by steamboat&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;If you was only here to convoy me&#8212;but I suppose no one is to have <hi rend="underline">every thing</hi> wanting&#8212;(Pete, dear son, there was $89 coming to you, of the money you put in my charge, 
                &amp; now there will be $69 yet due you from me&#8212;your own soap)&#8212;As I write, 
                it is 4½ o'clock Friday afternoon&#8212;I am sitting here alone, in the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> story front room&#8212;every thing quiet here&#8212;I rec'd the other letter, &amp; Sunday Chronicle&#8212;when you write, 
                tell me who you see, &amp; every thing,&#8212;I like such letters far better than the formal ones some send me&#8212;I had a visit from a good, kind-hearted, rather queer old fellow named Ingram,<ptr target="loc.01746_n1"/> from Philadelphia&#8212;he said he see in the <choice><abbr>Phil.</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan></choice> paper I was laid up very sick in Camden&#8212;so he came over, &amp; hunted for hours through the hot sun, found me at last&#8212;he evidently had thought I was keeled up, &amp; hard up, &amp; he came to offer help&#8212;he has been a great traveler, is English by birth&#8212;I found him good company, 
                &amp; was glad to see him&#8212;he has been twice&#8212;so you see there are good souls left&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Pete when you see Judge Fisher<ptr target="loc.01746_n2"/> tell him I shall yet be back all right one of these days, 
                &amp; in the mean time tell him I send him my love&#8212;also my love to Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash 
                the next time you go there&#8212;so good by for the present my darling son, 
                &amp; you must keep good heart, for I do, though it is pretty glum around &amp; over me sometimes</p>
