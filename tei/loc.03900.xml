                Year's day was rather flat, all around, so bleak &amp; cold &amp; deep snow&#8212;Still the women are out in their finery, plenty of them&#8212;I believe some would
                parade out in their new bonnets &amp; pretties if it froze their noses off&#8212;George, dear friend, how are you getting along this winter?&#8212;did you get the new
