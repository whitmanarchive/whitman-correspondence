            <p>As you requested me to write you after leaving the Hospital. I will do so for the first time. My wishes are that this may find you enjoying good health and plenty of kind friends to associate with.</p>  
            <p>I have not been over to Armory Square Hospital since leaveing it&#8212;. But have been expecting to call there and also to see you The orders here are very strict no one is allowed out side of Camp without a pass and the passes are scarse</p>
            <p>I shall manage to see you before I leave for the front if possible We are to get our horses in a day or so, and then be off to joine our Regiments</p>
            <p>The News are dull concerning the movements of the Army but for all that we expect to hear of a hard fought Battle before long. I think that we will be sent out as reenforcements so much the better</p>
            <p>Now Uncle I hope you will not believe that I had or have forgoten you. I will write again when at the front &amp; perhaps have something more worth writing about. I will close by expecting to have a better opportunity of writing some thing else when you hear from me again My health is good at present</p>
            <closer rend="right">
               <salute>believe me ever your friend</salute>
