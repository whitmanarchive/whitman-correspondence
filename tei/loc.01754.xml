                <salute>Dear son,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter of 8th came this morning&#8212;You did perfectly right<ptr target="loc.01754_n1"/>&#8212;I believe you are the greatest comfort I have &amp; if I get well, 
                our love &amp; attachment will be closer than ever. As I write it is about noon, 
                &amp; I am sitting up in my room, with a window open &amp; the bright sun streaming in. 
                I have confused spells of the head, &amp; have just had one, lasting about 20 minutes&#8212;they are not so bad &amp; prostrating as those of last week&#8212;I have to just sit still 
                &amp; wait till they pass over. I eat my breakfast with relish this morning, salmon, 
                Graham bread, coffee, &amp;c. But did not rest well last night. John Burroughs has been 
                to see me&#8212;staid a day &amp; night&#8212;he has settled up &amp; sold out in Washington, &amp; left&#8212;He is building a home on the Hudson river, 75 miles from N.Y.&#8212;has 10 acres 
                of land on west side of river. I am feeling quite bad to-day about a 13 year old boy[&#8212;]Rob Evans[&#8212;]I know here, next door but one&#8212;he has had his eye very badly hurt, 
                I fear it is put out, the doctor has given it up&#8212;by an arrow yesterday, the boys playing&#8212;I thought quite a good deal of him, he would do any thing for me&#8212;his father was French, 
                &amp; is dead&#8212;the boy suffers very much&#8212;&amp; the misfortune is a very, very sad one&#8212;</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01754.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>It is now ¼ after 12&#8212;&amp; every thing looks so sunny &amp; inviting out, I am going to try 
                to get out on the walk for a few minutes&#8212;but I don't navigate 
                as well as I did before I left <choice><abbr>Wn.</abbr><expan>Washington.</expan></choice>

                <p>Another beautiful day&#8212;I enjoy it, but cannot go around in it&#8212;I went out yesterday[&#8212;]not far[&#8212;]but was badly overcome before I got back. At present my head cannot stand 
                any thing. Still, to-day I am feeling rather better than usual. I have eat my dinner&#8212;beef steak &amp; <choice><sic>potatos</sic><corr>potatoes</corr></choice>, with pumpkin pie &amp; a cup of tea&#8212;I eat very moderately, 
                but with quite a relish. Dear Pete, serious as these spells are, (&amp; seems as if 
                they <hi rend="underline">will</hi> continue to come on,) I still have abiding hopes &amp; trust of my recovery yet&#8212;though I don't want to be too confident, &amp; wanted you to be prepared for whatever might happen. 
                I shall write a line to-day to Charles Eldridge&#8212;I am glad you have got some 
                acquainted with him&#8212;I know him thoroughly&#8212;he is a thoroughly good &amp; true man&#8212;has some ways &amp; notions of his own, but the main things are <hi rend="underline">as solid</hi> as the hills&#8212;Hinton too is a real good, kind man&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Now dear son <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> worry about me&#8212;I think in all probability we shall yet be together&#8212;&amp; that I shall come round to be wholly or partially better&#8212;but whichever way it goes 
                with me, it will be all right&#8212;your latest two letters have <hi rend="underline">been first rate</hi>&#8212;I read the one before the last, many times,&#8212;it is very dear to me.
