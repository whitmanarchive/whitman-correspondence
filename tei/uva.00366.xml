        <salute>Dearest mother<ptr target="n0705"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Well, mother dear, I am certainly getting well again&#8212;I have made a great improvement
        the last three days, &amp; my head feels clear &amp; good nearly all the time&#8212;&amp;
        that, the doctor says, will bring my leg all right in a little while&#8212;Yesterday was a
        beautiful day, &amp; I was out a good deal&#8212;walked some, a couple of blocks, for the
        first time&#8212;Peter Doyle convoyed me&#8212;This morning I have had my breakfast, and
        have been sitting by my open window looking out&#8212;it is very pleasant &amp; warm, but
        cloudy&#8212;we have heavy showers here nights&#8212;too much rain indeed&#8212;still spring
        is very fine here, &amp; it looks beautiful from my windows&#8212;I am writing this in my
        room&#8212;</p>

      <p>I am feeling just now well as usual in my general health&#8212;part of the time, just as
        well as ever&#8212;but of course I expect a few set&#8211;backs before I get well entirely, &amp;
        supple in my limbs&#8212;It is remarkable how much paralysis there is&#8212;cases occur
        here, every few days&#8212;&amp; in other cities&#8212;There is quite a time here about the
        burial of Mr. Chase,<ptr target="uva.00366_n1"/> his body is at the Capitol to&#8211;day, &amp; he
        is buried to&#8211;morrow&#8212;mother, the paper I send you has a picture of a railroad depot
        they are building here&#8212;it is for the road Peter Doyle works on&#8212;You will see a
        piece in that paper about the Beecher and Tilton scandal<ptr target="uva.00366_n2"
        />&#8212;it is very coarse&#8212;I think Beecher a great humbug, but I don't believe there
        is any truth in that piece&#8212;(but of course don't know)&#8212;</p>

      <p>I am still having electricity applied&#8212;the doctor applied it yesterday&#8212;I am
        certainly getting along better the last few days&#8212;feel better&#8212;feel more like
        myself&#8212;I shall come &amp; pay you a visit the first part of next month&#8212;shall
        write before I come, the time, &amp;c&#8212;Mother, I hope this will find you feeling
        better&#8212;I shall be anxious to hear&#8212;write a line or two, Tuesday&#8212;As I sit by
        the window this forenoon looking out, I wish you could take a look at the prospect, it is so
        fine, the trees &amp; grass so green, and the river &amp; hills in the distance&#8212;it
        does one good to look at it&#8212;</p>

      <closer>
        <salute>Mother, I shall feel anxious until I hear from you&#8212;</salute>
