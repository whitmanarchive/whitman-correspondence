            <p>Your son Erastus Haskell,<ptr target="nyh.00001_n1"/> of Co K 141st New York, is now lying sick with typhoid fever here in hospital.</p>
            <p>I have been with him quite a good deal, from day to day, was with him yesterday &amp; indeed almost every day, &amp; feel much interested in the young man. He has been very sick, &amp; seems to be so now, as I should judge, but the doctor says he will recover. I had a talk with the doctor yesterday, &amp; he says so still. But Erastus seems to me very sick, &amp; I thought I would write to you. He had some one write to you about two weeks ago, but has received no answer.</p>
            <p>Erastus does not talk much, so I do not understand much about his affairs. I am merely a friend. The address of Erastus is</p>
            <p>Ward E, Armory Square Hospital | Washington D C</p>
            <p>should you wish to write to him direct.</p>

            <p>Upon second thought I enclose you an envelope to send your letter to Erastus&#8212;put a stamp on it, &amp; write soon. I suppose you know he has been sick a great deal since he has been in the service.</p>
