      </opener>

      <p>I am sitting in my room waiting for the doctor&#8212;Mother, you are in my mind most of the
        time&#8212;I do hope as I write this you are feeling better&#8212;dear mother, do not get
        discouraged&#8212;there is so much in keeping good heart, (if one only can)&#8212;I think
        that is what has kept me up, &amp; is bringing me through&#8212;I think I am still on the
        gain, though it is very slow&#8212;my breakfast is brought up yet, has been this
        morning&#8212;I don't go out till about noon&#8212;then I <hi rend="italic">hitch</hi> over
        to the office, &amp; stay there for a couple of hours&#8212;then I hitch out &amp; get in
        the cars &amp; take quite a long ride, (sometimes jolting pretty lively, as the track is
        bad&#8212;but I don't mind it much)&#8212;I don't eat any dinner, only a light lunch, as I
        find it is much better for me&#8212;I certainly don't get behindhand any, that's pretty
        clear, &amp; I count on time bringing me all right&#8212;the only thing I think of now is
        you, dear mother, &amp; about your getting well and strong as usual&#8212;</p>

      <p>I got your letter yesterday (Thursday)&#8212;I suppose you got mine yesterday&#8212;I sent
        Hattie<ptr target="n0706"/> a late "Graphic,"<ptr target="yal.00417_n1"/> &amp; one to Han<ptr target="n0285"/>
        also&#8212;(the same as the last one I sent to you)&#8212;</p>

      <p>It is singular how much nervous disease there is&#8212;and many cases of paralysis &amp;
        apoplexy&#8212;I think there is something in the air, for a year past, last summer,
        especially&#8212;Fortunately, it seems as if most people got over it&#8212;</p>

      <p rend="right">Friday afternoon&#8212;1 oclock </p>

      <p>I am over at the office&#8212;Have got a letter from Sister Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> written Thursday
          morning,<ptr target="yal.00417_n2"/> which gives me great relief, as it says that Sunday
        was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now&#8212;Dear, dear mother, I hope you
        are still getting better&#8212;you must try to feel good courage&#8212;I shall come on soon,
        probably about the 1st of June&#8212;</p>

      <p>I have got a letter from John Burroughs this morning<ptr target="yal.00417_n3"/>&#8212;he
        &amp; wife are both a little homesick, for Washington&#8212;they had got a nice home
        here&#8212;but he is going to sell it&#8212;&amp; settle up there&#8212;he does better
        there&#8212;but he was doing well enough here, &amp; was very comfortable&#8212;My head
        troubles me to-day, but I am over here at my desk, at office&#8212;Mother, if convenient
        write me a line Sunday, so I will get it Monday&#8212;</p>
