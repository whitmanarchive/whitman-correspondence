            <p>I was right glad to get your card and find you hadn't forgotten me; and that you
                still keep going along, fairly cheerful. You must feel rather lonely at times. I
                have been wondering all night whether there is any sense in the world at
                all&#8212;and I don't know what to make of it! I have had a baddish time the last few
                days and feel tired out &#38; sick. A very dear friend of mine &#8212; we have been companions
                day &#38; night for many months now &#8212; has taken to girl whom I can't say I 
                much care for. She is right enough &#8212; &#38; they both have behaved awfully
                well to me; but just now I feel as if I had lost him and am rather dumpy
                &#8212; <choice><abbr>tho'</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> I don't know that it will be
                altogether bad in the end.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01241.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I am occupying a large attic here in a crowded &#38; smoky part of Sheffield, &#38;
                below am running a coffee tavern in conjunction with one or two Socialist friends.
                We (our Soct Society) have also a large room on the premises, and we have meetings
                pretty often, sociable evenings, lectures singing &#38;c. My friend of whom I spoke
                is in the cutlery trade, a razor grinder&#8212;very warmhearted free &#38; natural. Most
                of our fellows are very friendly &#38; sociable in their ways, &#38; we have good times. I
                still keep the place going at Millthorpe,<ptr target="n4124"/> &#38; spend part of my time
                there&#8212;and it is good to get out into the country from here. The
                    Fearnehoughs<ptr target="n3063"/> are still at Millthorpe, but Annie the girl
                has left and come into Sheffield to learn dress-making. Glad to hear from you
                any time, Walt. Write now &#38; then if you can. I suppose you will see Herbert
                    Gilchrist<ptr target="n0262"/> before long. With love to you as ever&#8212;
                &#38; we do not forget you over here.</p>
