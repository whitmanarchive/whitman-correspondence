               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I got your last letter Sunday morning, though it was dated Thursday night. Mother, I suppose you got a letter from me Saturday last, as I sent one the day before, as I was concerned about Andrew&#8212;If I thought it would be any benefit to Andrew I should certainly leave everything else &amp; come back to Brooklyn&#8212;mother, do you recollect what I wrote last summer about throat diseases,<ptr target="loc.00799_n1"/> when Andrew was first pretty bad&#8212;well that's the whole groundwork of the business, any true physician would confirm it&#8212;there is no great charm about such things&#8212;as to any costly &amp; mysterious baths, there are no better baths than warm water, or vapor, (&amp; perhaps sulphur vapor,) there is nothing costly or difficult about them&#8212;one can have a very good sweating bath, at a pinch, by having a pan of warm water under a chair &amp; heating a couple of bricks or stones or any thing to put in one after another, &amp; sitting on the chair with a couple of blankets around him to enclose the vapor&#8212;it is a very wholesome sweat too, &amp; not to be sneezed at if one wishes to do what is salutary, &amp; thinks of the sense of a thing, &amp; not what others do&#8212;Andrew mustn't be discouraged, those diseases are painful &amp; tedious, but he can recover &amp; will yet&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear mother, I sent your last letter to George with a short one I wrote myself, I sent it yesterday&#8212;I sent a letter last Wednesday 14th to him also, hoping that if one don't reach him another will&#8212;hasn't Jeff seen Capt Sims or Lieut McReady<ptr target="loc.00799_n2"/> yet, &amp; don't they hear whether the 51st is near Nicholasville, Kentucky, yet? I send George papers now &amp; then&#8212;Mother, one of your letters contains part of my letter to the Union,<ptr target="loc.00799_n3"/> (I wish I could have got the whole of it.) It seems to be mostly as I intended it, barring a few slight misprints&#8212;was my last name signed at the bottom of it? tell me when you write next<ptr target="loc.00799_n4"/>&#8212;Dear mother, I am real sorry &amp; mad too that the water works people have cut Jeff's wages down to $50<ptr target="loc.00799_n5"/>&#8212;this is a pretty time to cut a man's wages down&#8212;the mean old punkin heads&#8212;mother, I can't understand it at all&#8212;tell me more the particulars&#8212;Jeff, I often wish you was on here, you would be better appreciated, there is big salaries paid here sometimes to civil engineers&#8212;Jeff, I know a fellow, E C Stedman,<ptr target="loc.00799_n6"/> has been here till lately, is now in Wall street, he is poor but he is in with the big bankers (Hallett &amp; Co) who are in with Fremont<ptr target="loc.00799_n7"/> in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> line of Pacific railroad&#8212;I can get his (Stedman's) address, &amp; should you wish it any time I will give you a letter to him&#8212;I shouldn't wonder if the big men, with Fremont at head, were going to push their route, works, road, &amp;c &amp;c. in earnest, &amp; if a fellow could get a good managing place in it, why it might be worth while&#8212;I think after Jeff has been with the Brooklyn W[ater] W[orks] from the beginning, &amp; so faithful &amp; so really valuable, to put down to $50, the mean low-lived old shoats. I have felt as indignant about it, the meanness of the thing, &amp; mighty inconvenient too, $40 a month makes a big difference&#8212;Mother, I hope Jeff won't get &amp; keep himself in a perpetual fever, with all these things &amp; others &amp; botherations, both family &amp; business ones&#8212;if he does, he will just wear himself down before his time comes&#8212;I do hope, Jeff, you will take things equably all round, &amp; not brood or think too deeply&#8212;So I go giving you all good advice&#8212;</p>
            <p>O Mother, I must tell you how I get along in my new quarters, I have moved to a new room, 456 Sixth street, not far from Pennsylvania avenue, (the big street here,) &amp; not far from the Capitol&#8212;it is in 3d story, an addition back, seems to be going to prove a very good winter room, as it is right under the roof &amp; looks south, has low windows, is plenty big enough, I have gas&#8212;I think the lady will prove a good woman, she is old &amp; feeble, (there is a little girl of 4 or 5, I hear her sometimes calling <hi rend="italic">grandma</hi>, <hi rend="italic">grandma</hi> just exactly like Hat, it made me think of you &amp; Hat right away)&#8212;one thing is I am quite by myself, there is no passage up there except to my room, &amp; right off against my side of the house is a great old yard with grass &amp; some trees back, &amp; the sun shines in all day &amp;c. &amp; it smells sweet &amp; good air, good big bed, I sleep first rate&#8212;there is a young wench of 12 or 13, Lucy, (the niggers here are the best &amp; most amusing creatures you ever see)&#8212;she comes &amp; goes, gets water &amp;c., she is pretty much the only one I see&#8212;then I believe the front door is not locked at all at night&#8212;(in the other place the old thief the landlord had two front doors, with four locks &amp; bolts on one, &amp; three on the other&#8212;&amp; a big bull-dog in the back yard&#8212;we were well fortified I tell you&#8212;sometimes I had an awful time at night getting in)&#8212;I pay $10 a month, this includes gas, but not fuel&#8212;Jeff, you can come on &amp; see me easy now&#8212;Mother, to give you an idea of prices here, while I was looking for rooms, I went in to see a couple of furnished rooms about like our two in Wheelers houses<ptr target="loc.00799_n8"/> (2d story), nothing extra about them, either in location or any thing, &amp; the rent was $60 a month&#8212;yet quite curious vacant houses here are not so very dear, very much the same as in Brooklyn&#8212;dear mother, Jeff wrote in his letter<ptr target="loc.00799_n9"/> latter part of last week you was real unwell with a very bad cold, (&amp; that you didn't have enough good meals)&#8212;mother, I hope this will find you well &amp; good spirits&#8212;I think about you every day &amp; night&#8212;Jeff thinks you show your age more, &amp; failing like&#8212;O my dear mother, you must not think of failing yet&#8212;I hope we shall have some comfortable years yet. Mother, don't you allow things, troubles, to take hold of you&#8212;write a few lines whenever you can, tell me exactly <hi rend="italic">how</hi> things are&#8212;Mother, I am first rate &amp; well, only a little of that deafness again&#8212;good bye for present.</p>

            <p>Mother, I am of course every day in hospitals&#8212;they are pretty full now, some very bad wounds&#8212;Mother, it is the opinion here this morning that Lee has vamosed back into lower Virginia again but there's no telling&#8212;he's a cunning old fox&#8212;he may make a dash at us here before we know it<ptr target="loc.00799_n10"/>&#8212;</p>
