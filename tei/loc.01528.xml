      </opener>

      <p>Well here I am home again with my mother, writing to you from Brooklyn once more. We parted
        there, you know, at the corner of 7th st. Tuesday night. Pete, there was something in that
        hour from 10 to 11 oclock (parting though it was) that has left me pleasure &amp; comfort
        for good&#8212;I never dreamed that you made so much of having me with you, nor that you
        could feel so downcast at losing me. I foolishly thought it was all on the other side. But
        all I will say further on the subject is, I now see clearly, that was all wrong. </p>

      <p>I started from the depot in the 7:25 train the next morning&#8212;it was pretty warm, yet I
        had a very pleasant journey, &amp; we got in New York by 5 o'clock, afternoon. About half an
        hour before we arrived, I noticed a very agreeable change in the weather&#8212;the heat had
        moderated&#8212;&amp; in fact it has been pleasant enough every day since. I found mother
        &amp; all as well as usual. It is now Saturday between 4 &amp; 5 in the afternoon&#8212;I
        will write more on the other side&#8212;but, Pete, I must now hang up for the present, as
        there is a young lady down stairs whom I have promised to go with to the ferry, &amp; across
        to the cars. </p>

      <p rend="right">Sunday&#8212;6 p. m. </p>

      <p>Pete, dear boy, I will write you a line to-day before I go. I am going over to New York to
        visit the lady I went down to the ferry with&#8212;so you see I am quite a lady's man again
        in my old days&#8212;There is nothing special to write about&#8212;I am feeling in
        first-rate spirits, &amp; eat my rations every time. </p>

      <p rend="right">Monday, Aug 1 </p>

      <p>The carrier brought quite a bunch this forenoon for the Whitman family, but no letter from
        you. I keep real busy with one thing &amp; another, the whole day is occupied&#8212;I am
        feeling well quite all the time, &amp; go out a great deal, knocking around one place &amp;
        another. The evenings here are delightful and I am always out in them, sometimes on the
        river, sometimes in New York&#8212;There is a cool breeze &amp; the moon shining. I think
        every time of you, &amp; wish if we could only be together these evenings at any rate. </p>

      <p rend="right">Tuesday&#8212;Aug 2. </p>

      <p>Well, Pete, you will have quite a diary at this rate. Your letter came this
        morning&#8212;&amp; I was glad enough to get word from you. I have been over to New York
        to-day on business&#8212;it is a pleasure even to cross the ferry&#8212;the river is
        splendid to-day&#8212;a stiff breeze blowing &amp; the smell of the salt sea blowing up,
        (sweeter than any perfume to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> nose)&#8212;It is now 2
        o'clock&#8212;I have had my dinner &amp; am sitting here alone writing this&#8212;Love to
        you, dear Pete&#8212;&amp; I wont be so long again writing to my darling boy. </p>
