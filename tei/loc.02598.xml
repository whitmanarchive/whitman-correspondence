                have thought that the world was not ready for such a move yet. And besides, I am
                inclined to think with Stedman, that (to such poor limited and petty creatures as we bipeds
                are) there is something intrinsically disagreeable in the various grosser functions
                of the body.</p>

            <p>I hope we shall grow to be such giants sometime that this will not be so. But that it
                is the case now, I do not see how we can help admitting. I can't for my poor self at
                any rate. But never mind this, I congratulate you again on this success.</p>
