            <p>I am not overfond of letter-writing&#8212;rather hate it indeed&#8212;I am so
                overburdened with correspondence that I neglect half of it&#8212;nevertheless let me
                hope that I answered your last of September 14 '76&#8212;&#38; that it
                    miscarried.<ptr target="tex.00358_n1"/> I am very glad to hear that you are so
                improved in health, that you move about the fields &#38; woods freely &#38; have
                enjoyment of your life.</p>

            <p>As to myself I am pretty well for my time of life&#8212;sixty nine on the sixth of
                this month&#8212;but somewhat troubled about my eyes&#8212;for I am not only the
                shortest-sighted man in England&#8212;but have a great black island floating in each
                eye, &#38; these blacknesses increase with increasing years. However my oculist
                informs me that I shall not go blind, &#38; bids me as much as possible spare my
                eyes, neither reading nor writing too much.</p>

            <p>My wife is still an invalid &#38; forced to lie on the sofa all day but still I trust
                somewhat stronger than when I last wrote to you.</p>

            <p>My younger son Lionel (whom you inquire about) was married to the daughter of F.
                    Locker<ptr target="tex.00358_n2"/> (the author of London Lyrics) in <choice>
                    <abbr>Feby</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice>&#8212;the wedding was celebrated in our old grand historical Abbey of
                Westminster&#8212;there was a great attendance of literati &#38;c of all which I
                read an account in one of your New-York papers&#8212;every third word a lie!
                Tru&#776;bner wrote to me this morning, stating that you wished to see a parody of
                yourself, which appeared among other parodies of modern authors in a paper called
                'The London'&#8212;I have it not or I would sent it you. Goodbye, good friend. I
                think I have answered all your questions.</p>
