        <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I will write you a few lines as I sit here, on a clump of sand by the sea shore&#8212;having some paper in my haversack, 
        &amp; an hour or two yet, before I start back. Pete, I wish you were with me the few hours past&#8212;I have just had a splendid swim &amp; souse in the surf&#8212;the waves are slowly rolling in, with a hoarse roar 
        that is music to my ears&#8212;the breeze blows pretty brisk from south-west, &amp; the sun is partially clouded&#8212;from where I sit I look out on the bay &amp; down the Narrows&#8212;vessels sailing in every direction in the distance&#8212;a great big black long ocean steamship streaking it up toward New York&#8212;&amp; the lines of hills &amp; mountains, far, 
        far away, on the Jersey Coast, a little veiled with blue vapor&#8212;here around me, as I sit, it is nothing but barren sand&#8212;but I don't know how long I could sit here, to that soothing, rumbling murmuring of the waves&#8212;&amp; then the salt breeze&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Pete, if you are still working, and all is going on smooth, you can send me that $50&#8212;you might get Mr. Milburn to send it to me by post-office order&#8212;give it to him, with this envelope, 
        &amp; ask him to go to p. o. &amp; send a p. o. order to me&#8212;it will save you the trouble&#8212;But Pete, dear boy, 
        if any thing has turned up in mean time, you needn't send it, as I can get along otherwise<ptr target="loc.01536_n1"/>&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I am doing very well, both in health &amp; <hi rend="italic">business prospects</hi> here&#8212;my book is doing first rate&#8212;so every thing is lovely &amp; the goose hangs high&#8212;Your loving comrade &amp; father
      </p>

        <p>Dear son, I wrote the preceding nearly a week ago, intending to finish &amp; send it then&#8212;Nothing very new or special with me&#8212;Mother has been quite unwell, gets better, &amp; then worse again&#8212;I have applied for a few days further leave&#8212;The weather here remains nearly perfect&#8212;we have had but three or four uncomfortably hot days the past five weeks&#8212;every day a fine breeze smelling of the sea&#8212;</p>
