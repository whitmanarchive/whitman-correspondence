                <salute>My dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I'll write you a few
                words again&#8212;for this warm weather
                enough of a "plentiful suffering" to
                tax your patience, I doubt not.
            </p>
            <p>When I read in the
                last <hi rend="underline">Index</hi> of you having spoken on
                Garrison at the <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" quantity="1"/> Memorial I was
                warmly curious to know what you could 
                have said. My curiosity has not abated by
                one jot and I would esteem it a favor
                if you would let me know at
                least the <hi rend="underline">substance</hi> of your matter.
                Was it published? If not you ought
                send it to the <hi rend="underline">Index</hi>: at this I would
                be overjoyed, for I could then see &amp;
                appreciate it without putting you
                to any trouble. Will you do so if it has
                not already been printed?
            </p>
            <p>About your mail here
                (or in Philadelphia), I am not forgetful. In
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jp.00196a.jpg" type="verso"/>
                this delightful weather I think so often of the
                pleasurable walks and chats we could have
                in the Park if you were only here to make
                the second party! Must I ever hope against
                hope? Fiddlesticks and gridirons! what a
                little deceiver hope <hi rend="underline">can</hi> be! Yet, <hi rend="underline">will</hi> you
                come? I yearn along in a devil-care sort
                of a way for that lecture from you, &amp;
                those keen bits of wisdom, and a trifle of
                your sarcasm. But if I even think all
                this, I do not for a twitch forget that you
                owe me nothing&#8212;no such pleasure or gratification&#8212;and
                that if it ever really comes, I am the
                lucky dog and you the Sir Beneficence. 
            </p>
            <p>On the hour-cars the
                other night I fell in with an ex-professor
                of a theological seminary somewhere out
                of Philadelphia. We talked a long while. I 
                quizzed and he discoursed. This lasted well nigh
                an hour, and at last, when his religious questions
                got more personal, I had to let out that I
                was a pagan. He looked askance and a trifle
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jp.00196b.jpg" type="recto"/>
                stern with brows drawn, but I speedily taxed his
                toleration and he relaxed. Finally he went
                his way and I mine&#8212;and the Sagacious 
                Unknowable himself but knows when we'll
                meet again! Still, I found the man very
                tolerant&#8212;as befits a reader of Goethe, Schiller
                Lessing and his royal brothers-in-Truth&#8212;and
                the conversation may last in memory.
            </p>
            <p>I have waded through another novel&#8212;Charles
                Reade's "It's never too late to mind."
                Excepting a chapter here and there, I do
                not fancy it much. My bias is for Dickens.
                I like a good <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">aim</unclear> of pathos in a novel&#8212;nothing
                maudlin but all natural. I think Dickens
                supplies this about as good as the next. William
                Black is good, usually, in the respect, though apt
                to overdo. It always seems to me that
                only a hard-headed man can read, for a 
                case, in "David Copperfield," Pegotty's account
                of his search on the Continent
                for Little Emily&#8212;without tearful eyes.
                To think of it alone often makes me sad&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_nhg.00643.jpg" type="verso"/>makes me anxious in a way that does me good. I think I could almost like the poet Gray, live in an atmosphere of novels forever&#8212;devour them, figuratively speaking. 'Tisn't the solidest food at all times, and I ought not thus exaggerate; but I have a sincere passion for the best among them, and can't honestly deny it. 
            </p>
            <p>When you write I would like to have you tell me about that Goethe-Schiller matter. I think I referred to it in one of my last letters.</p>
