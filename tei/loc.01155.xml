            </opener>
            <p> We returned from our wanderings last week. On the whole had a fairly good time. I had a good glimpse of a large
                section of the country. I spent 10 days in Washington, then went to Ky. where I stayed till 1st of
                June, &#38; joined wife<ptr target="n0892"/> &#38; Julian<ptr target="loc.01151_n1"/> in Chicago June 5th. I found Wm O'Connor<ptr target="n2002"/> 
                better than I expected to; his mind <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01155.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> seems clear
                &#38; strong, &#38; his lameness not very bad. But there is probably little chance of his
                ever being any better. A sea voyage is the thing for him, but he will not go. He has
                probably got that horrible disease called <hi rend="underline">progressive locomotor
                    ataxia</hi> I saw him several times at his office. He felt a little insecure in
                his place, but I don't believe he will be disturbed. Washington was very beautiful &#38; I was glad to be
                there again. My sleep was very poor while in Ky, but I think of it as the finest 
                country I have yet seen&#8212;that is the blue grass <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01155.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                region of it; much ahead of anything I saw in Ill. or 
                Ind. or Ohio. I went to St Louis, &#38; sailed from there up to Quincy on the <choice>
                    <orig>Missippi.</orig>  
                    <reg>Mississippi</reg> 
                </choice> I was ten days in Chicago, the N.Y. of the west, &#38; destined to be an
                enormous city. We stopped at Cleveland with friends, then at Niagara &#38; at Utica.
                Julian saw many wonders &#38; got many ideas. I am very glad to be home again. It is
                getting to be a great bore for me to gad about to see things. I hope you are better
                than when I saw you. You should make a determined attempt to keep your bowells open.
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01155.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> It makes me
                shudder when I remember what you said about their torpidity. I could not live a
                month so. Your head would be all right if you could keep your bowells open. Frank
                Baker<ptr target="loc.01155_n1"/> said that an outward movement, such as chafing &#38; <choice>

                do that for 1/2 hour each day, also drink a good deal of water. <choice><sic>Hathern</sic><corr>Hathorn</corr></choice> Spring water<ptr target="loc.01155_n3"/> from Saratoga would be good. Also a
                wet towel over the liver. Drop me a line how you are, &#38; if you have any plan to
                get away from C. for the summer. </p>
