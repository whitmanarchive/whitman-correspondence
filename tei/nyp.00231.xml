            <p>I<ptr target="nyp.00231_n100"/> have since learned that you called at the "DeSoto" immediately after I had left. I remained there till 6:30 P.M. &amp; thinking that you were prevented calling by another engagement, I left for home. I would be happy to meet you at any time you may be pleased to appoint. In company with Capt Holbrook I invited a gentleman, who has a relative&#8212;a prisoner of war at Camp Chase, Ohio. he is desirous of obtaining the name of <pb facs="nyp.00231.002.jpg" type="recto"/>some Captains, an order to obtain his exchange, by securing the release of the Captains. Your brother's name was given &amp; the party promised to act upon it immediately. I can say nothing of its results.</p>
            <p>Several of my brother officers are desirous of obtaining a copy of "the Reconnysance" by Capt Sim's. &amp; I would esteem it as a great favor, if you would enclose it, in a letter &amp; send it to my address. I will assure you of its being returned in good order.</p>
            <p>You will please accept a copy of my Ca<gap reason="illegible"/> accounts in exchange for your own. <pb facs="nyp.00231.003.jpg" type="recto"/> With every assurance of respect I remain</p>
