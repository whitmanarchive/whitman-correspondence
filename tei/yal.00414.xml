        <salute>Dearest mother<ptr target="n0705"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I have had one or two quite good spells&#8212;but am not feeling well just now&#8212;have
        got over to the office, &amp; am now sitting at my desk&#8212;it is a rainy day here, not
        very cool&#8212;Mother, I have nothing particular to write to-day either&#8212;but thought I
        would send just a few lines, as you might like to get something&#8212;The season is quite
        advanced here&#8212;pleasant the past few days, I have been out in the cars every day. I
        have not written very lately either to Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/> or Hannah<ptr target="n0285"/>&#8212;</p>

      <p>Well, Mammy dear, how are you getting along at Camden<ptr target="yal.00414_n1"
      />&#8212;&amp; how are Lou<ptr target="n0368"/> and George<ptr target="n0700"/>&#8212;I often wish you were here,
        mother dear, as it would be such a relief to me to have you where I could see you, &amp;
        talk a while&#8212;I think there is no doubt that, take the time right through, I gain
        steadily, though very slowly indeed&#8212;but I get many tedious spells, both of head &amp;
        limbs&#8212;there seems to be great deal of paralysis&#8212;I hear, or read of cases, every
        day&#8212;One man here to-day told me of his father, who had a very bad stroke at 70 years
        of age, but got over it after all, and lived 17 or 18 years after, by great care&#8212;So I
        hear of many cases, some good, some unfavorable&#8212;</p>

      <p>As to myself, I do not lose faith for a moment, in my ultimate recovery&#8212;though, as I
        said, I have some bad hours&#8212;sometimes very bad&#8212;Well, mama dear, I have scribbled
        out this sheet nearly, such as it is&#8212;I sent you a letter last Monday<ptr
          target="yal.00414_n2"/>&#8212;I have changed the address on the envelopes to you, mother,
        as you see<ptr target="yal.00414_n3"/>&#8212;is it right?&#8212;I am feeling better&#8212;my
        head is some easier&#8212;Love to you, dear mama, &amp; all&#8212;</p>
