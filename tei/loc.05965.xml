                <salute>Dear Friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your paper was received
                yesterday and was very much pleased with the
                Contents and also with your kindness in sending it.
                I saw in the paper the death of Mrs Johnson. I was
                very much surprised to see it and felt very sad about it
                although a stranger to me I never met one so lady
                like and pleasing as she was and made the remark
                several times what an entertaining hostess she was I thought
                she must have made your visit very pleasant for you
                while there. I am glad that your health is better
                than it has been. Our little Walter has been very sick
                since I saw you we were afraid we would lose him
                but is just well now all the rest are well, send
                <choice><sic>there</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> love to you hoping to see you soon.
            </p>

                <p>PS Ma desires me to say do not forget us Woodsiders
                    this summer.
