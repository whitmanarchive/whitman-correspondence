                    your week of laying off, &amp; of the playing of the band under Schneider and

                <p>&#8212;I have had a bad spell again this week&#8212;for three days I have had a
                    succession of those <hi rend="underline">blurs</hi> again&#8212;only very much
                    worse than ever before&#8212;last night I slept pretty well, &amp; <choice><orig>havn't</orig><reg>haven't</reg></choice> had
                    any of them yet to-day, but my head feels sore &amp; ready to have them, almost
                    if I move across the room&#8212;I am sitting here, feeling pretty bad, <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01753.002.jpg" type="verso"/> my head unsettled
                    and dizzy&#8212;I don't go out any more&#8212;but am up &amp;

                <p>&#8212;Still Pete I do not get discouraged but think it will pass over, &amp; I
                    shall feel better, &amp; strong enough to come back to Washington&#8212;Still I
                    don't know&#8212;I think it best to face my situation&#8212;it is pretty
                    serious. I send you a card&#8212;&amp; if I should get bad, I will certainly
                    send you word, or telegraph&#8212;I will write Monday or Tuesday next&#8212;We
                    have moved into my brother's new house&#8212;I am up in the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> story room, fronting south&#8212;the sun is
                    shining in bright&#8212;it is beautiful October weather here&#8212;My brother
                    had a large room, very handsome, on 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> floor, with
                    large bay window fronting west built for me, but I moved up here instead, it is
                    much more retired, &amp; has the sun&#8212;I am very comfortable here indeed,
                    but my <hi rend="underline">heart</hi> is blank &amp; lonesome utterly</p>

                    with&#8212;he has a bad bone-gathering on his left hand, a sort of felon,
                    suffered greatly with it 5 days &amp; nights&#8212;had it lanced yesterday,
                    &amp; is better&#8212;he stood by the open window, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> floor, &amp; talked with me, while I sat in an
                    arm-chair inside&#8212;he is a regular RR. man&#8212;you could tell by the cut
                    of his jib, low collar, cap, clean shirt (for holiday) dark complexion, &amp;
                    hard dark hands. I took quite a fancy to him &amp; <hi rend="underline">of

                    different times&#8212;It gave me a good idea of what you are doing&#8212;&amp;
                    also of how things look in Washington.&#8212;I have written a line to Col.

                    watch&#8212;(but it will be much better for us to spend the money together,

                <p>Pete I have written plainly, because I want you to be prepared, if any thing
