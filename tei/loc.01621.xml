                <salute>Dear son Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>By accident your usual letter was not sent to P.O. so that you could get it Saturday&#8212;which may have made you some uneasy&#8212;but you need not be, as I still continue to hold my own, 
                full as good as at previous advices&#8212;I still remain clear of any of those real bad spells 
                of the head&#8212;I cannot walk any better yet&#8212;but otherwise am getting along <hi rend="underline">very favorably</hi>&#8212;I rec'd your postal card acknowledging the 10. I get out every fair day&#8212;shall go out about 4 to visit a family here, Col. Johnston,<ptr target="loc.01621_n1"/> the jolliest man I ever met, an artist, a great talker, but real, natural first-rate, 
                off-hand cheerfulness &amp; <hi rend="underline">comical-sensible</hi> talk&#8212;a man of good information too, 
                travelled in Europe&#8212;an hour or two does me real good&#8212;he has a wife, 
                daughter &amp; son, all good&#8212;I go Sunday evenings to tea&#8212;Pete I send you a paper 
                with a piece in about Richmond affairs, manufactures, &amp;c I thought you might like to look over<ptr target="loc.01621_n2"/>&#8212;Here there is great talk of the proposed Centennial Exposition<ptr target="loc.01621_n3"/>&#8212;I will send you pictures of the buildings soon&#8212;</p><pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01621.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>I am sitting here in my room, 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> story&#8212;We have had quite a storm&#8212;but at present the sun shines out, by spells&#8212;I am feeling quite comfortable&#8212;I would almost think of coming back to Washington&#8212;but have learned not 
                to make calculations <hi rend="underline">too soon</hi> or <hi rend="underline">too sanguine</hi>&#8212;so I shall remain here for the present&#8212;If you see Col. Hinton tell him I am getting 
                along favorably&#8212;tell him Mr. Linton,<ptr target="loc.01621_n4"/> the artist, has lately called upon me&#8212;tell Hinton to be sure &amp; come and call on me, 
                should he come to Philadelphia&#8212;Tell Wash Milburn, &amp; Parker also, I send them my love, 
                &amp; that I shall be back to Washington this winter&#8212;tell Parker I was sorry to hear of his illness&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;As I write, the wind is crooning and whistling around the house at a great rate&#8212;it is a music though I like to hear&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;That is a bad business, the shooting of Ryan, and the three good fellows, in Cuba<ptr target="loc.01621_n5"/>&#8212;the Spaniards will probably just keep on at their bloody tricks till the U.S. 
                (&amp; perhaps England) steps in &amp; kicks them out of Cuba&#8212;which in my opinion ought to be done 
                without delay&#8212;I suppose you knew Ryan by sight, he was around Washington so much&#8212;Well, good bye for this time, dear loving boy&#8212;</p>
