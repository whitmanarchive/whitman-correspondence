            <p>I enclose a copy of a letter I got yesterday from John Burroughs, as you may like to see what he says of Rossetti. It is incredible that a man who translated Dante, and knows what art and taste sanction in the <hi rend= "underline">Divina Comedia</hi>, can have
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03061.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                so gone back on  his old acceptance of your book. It is sad and sickening.</p>
            <p>I have your postal card of the 11th. It is funny, but take it for all in all, the newspaper account of the P.M.G's decision is right&#8212;the interior sense, as Swedenborg would say, being about as they

                say. The story has gone broadcast over the country, and must have dismayed the Comstockians.</p>
            <p>Comstock, Ingersoll tells me, is not an honest bigot, but an arrant black-hearted scoundrel. This he personally knows of him.</p>
            <p>When the new edition comes out, we may expect a row.</p>

            <p>George Chainey had better be careful, or they may nip him with a libel suit. He has just done an astonishing thing&#8212;printed my private letter in his paper&#8212;the letter in which I asked him for information. This is too bad and he ought to know better. A letter of yours also is given. I am surprised at his lack of sense.</p>
