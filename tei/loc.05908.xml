            <p>A kind of anxiety has for some time past weighed upon me and upon others, I find, who
                love &#38; admire you, that you do not have all the comforts you ought to have; that
                you are perhaps sometimes straightened for means. We have had letters from several
                young men, almost or quite strangers to us, asking questions on this subject; and we
                hoped &#38; thought that if this were so, you would permit those who have received
                such priceless gifts from you to put their gratitude into some tangible shape, some
                "free-will offering." Hence the paragraph was put into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenaeum</hi> which I send with this,<ptr target="loc.05908_n2"/> and we were
                proceeding to organize our forces when your paper came to hand this morning (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Camden Post</hi>, July 3), which seems decisively to bid us
                desist. Or at all events wait till we had told you of our wishes and plan. One thing
                would, I feel sure, give you pleasure in any case; and that is to know that there is
                over here a little band&#8212;perhaps indeed it is now quite a considerable one, for
                we had not yet had time to ascertain how considerable&#8212;who would joyfully
                respond to that Poem of yours, "To Rich Givers." </p>
            <p>A friend and near neighbour of ours, Frederick Wedmore,<ptr target="loc.02188_n1"/> is coming over to America
                this autumn, and counts much on coming to see you. He is a well-known writer on Art
                here&#8212;a friendly, candid, open-minded man with whom, I think, you will enjoy a
                    talk.</p>
            <p>I am on the lookout for Miss Smith<ptr target="loc.05908_n1"/>&#8212;shall indeed
                enjoy a talk with a special friend of yours, dear Walt. I hope she will not fail to
                come. Giddy<ptr target="n0890"/> is away at Haslemere. Herby<ptr target="n0262"/>
                just going to write for himself to you.</p>
            <p>That is a very graphic bit in the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>&#8212;the portrait of
                Hugo, the canary &#38; the kitten<ptr target="loc.05908_n3"/>&#8212;I like to know
                all that&#8212;as well as to hear the talk.</p>
