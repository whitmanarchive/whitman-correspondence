            <p>Mother, it seems to be certain that Meade<ptr target="loc.00775_n2"/> has gained the day, &amp; that the battles there in Pennsylvania have been about as terrible as any in the war&#8212;O what a sight must have been presented by the field of action&#8212;I think the killed &amp; wounded there on both sides were as many as eighteen or twenty thousand&#8212;in one place, four or five acres, there were a thousand dead, at daybreak on Saturday morning&#8212;Mother, one's heart grows sick of war, after all, when you see what it really is&#8212;every once in a while I feel so horrified &amp; disgusted&#8212;it seems to me like a great slaughter-house &amp; the men mutually butchering each other&#8212;then I feel how impossible it appears, again, to retire from this contest, until we have carried our points&#8212;(it is cruel to be so tossed from pillar to post in one's judgment).</p>
            <p>Washington is a pleasant place in some respects&#8212;it has the finest trees, &amp; plenty of them every where, on the streets, &amp; grounds. The Capitol grounds, though small, have the finest cultivated trees I ever see&#8212;there is a great variety, &amp; not one but is in perfect condition&#8212;After I finish this letter I am going out there for an hour's recreation&#8212;The great sights of Washington are the public buildings, the wide streets, the public grounds, the trees, the Smithsonian Institute &amp; grounds&#8212;I go to the latter occasionally&#8212;the Institute is an old fogy concern, but the grounds are fine<ptr target="loc.00775_n3"/>&#8212;Sometimes I go up to Georgetown, about two &amp; a half miles up the Potomac, an old town&#8212;just opposite it in the river is an island, where the niggers have their first Washington reg't encamped&#8212;they make a good show, are often seen in the streets of Washington in squads&#8212;since they have begun to carry arms, the secesh here &amp; in Georgetown (about 3/5ths) are not insulting to them as formerly.</p>
            <p>One of the things here always on the go, is long trains of army wagons&#8212;sometimes they will stream along all day, it almost seems as if there was nothing else but army wagons &amp; ambulances&#8212;they have great camps here in every direction, of army wagons, teamsters, ambulance camps, &amp;c. Some of them are permanent, &amp; have small hospitals&#8212;I go to them, (as no one else goes, ladies would not venture)&#8212;I sometimes have the luck to give some of the drivers a great deal of comfort &amp; help. Indeed, mother, there are camps here of every thing&#8212;I went once or twice to the Contraband Camp,<ptr target="loc.00775_n4"/> to the Hospital, &amp;c. but I could not bring myself to go again&#8212;when I meet black men or boys among my own hospitals, I use them kindly, give them something, &amp;c.&#8212;I believe I told you that I do the same to the wounded rebels, too&#8212;but as there is a limit to one's sinews &amp; endurance &amp; sympathies, &amp;c. I have got in the way after going lightly as it were all through the wards of a hospital, &amp; trying to give a word of cheer, if nothing else, to every one, then confining my special attentions to the few where the investment seems to tell best, &amp; who want it most&#8212;Mother, I have real pride in telling you that I have the consciousness of saving quite a little number of lives by saving them from giving up &amp; being a good deal with them&#8212;the men say it is so, &amp; the doctors say it is so&#8212;&amp; I will candidly confess I can see it is true, though I say it of myself&#8212;I know you will like to hear it, mother, so I tell you&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am finishing this in Major Hapgood's office, about 1 o'clock&#8212;it is pretty warm, but has not cleared off yet&#8212;the trees look so well from where I am, &amp; the Potomac&#8212;it is a noble river&#8212;I see it several miles, &amp; Arlington heights&#8212;Mother, I see some of the 47th Brooklyn every day or two&#8212;the reg't is on the Heights&#8212;back of Arlington House, a fine camp ground&#8212;O, Matty, I have just thought of you&#8212;dear sister, how are you getting along? Jeff, I will write you truly&#8212;Good bye for the present, dearest mother, &amp; all&#8212;</p>
