            <p>I thought I would write a day before the usual time, as I did not send any letter last Saturday. For the last two days I have felt a good deal better&#8212;My head is much better, &amp; I feel more like myself every way. I sent Han a short letter last Friday, &amp; sent the piece from the "Galaxy"<ptr target="tex.00152_n1"/>&#8212;I thought it would please her.</p>
            <p>I went to the Hospital yesterday afternoon&#8212;took a lot of tobacco, &amp;c. I wrote several letters&#8212;there are quite a good many, some with sickness, some with old wounds&#8212;two or three in the last stages of consumption, &amp;c. I go every Sunday, &amp; sometimes Wednesday also&#8212;There are many of the patients, very young men, country boys&#8212;several from the Southern states, whose parents &amp; homes &amp; families are gone or broke up&#8212;&amp; they have enlisted in the regular army&#8212;then they get down with fever or something, &amp; are sent to Hospital&#8212;I find most of them can't read or write&#8212;there are many of these homeless Southern young men now enlisted in the regulars&#8212;they have no other resource&#8212;</p>
            <p>We have quite a procession here to-day to "welcome Congress"&#8212;two-thirds of it consists of darkies&#8212;they look very well too&#8212;the streets are jammed with darkies&#8212;I tell you when they do turn out here they are thicker than crows in a cornfield&#8212;</p>
            <p>The O'Connors have got to move&#8212;but can't get a house suitable&#8212;Every thing in the office same as usual&#8212;We are having beautiful bright, coolish weather&#8212;</p>
            <p>Thursday last, Thanksgiving day, four of us went out in Maryland 15 miles, to see the Great Falls, on the Potomac. We carried a basket of grub, built a fire &amp; made tea, &amp;c&#8212;had a first rate, quiet time&#8212;the Falls were a fine sight&#8212;almost as impressive as Niagara&#8212;I much enjoyed the ride &amp; every thing, &amp; it did me good&#8212;I felt well, all day, &amp; have felt quite well ever since. Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to all.</p>
