                <salute>Dear Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I received your note of 30 Novr,<ptr target="loc.03610_n1"/> &#38; have been
                intending to write for some little while past. </p>
            <p> You &#38; I have both suffered a loss in the death of that admirable woman Mrs
                    Gilchrist<ptr target="loc.02182_n1"/>&#8212;a strong warm nature, full of strong
                sympathetic sense &#38; frank cordiality. I look round the circle of my acquaintance
                for her equal. Much might be said on such a topic: but often a little is as good as
                much. </p>
            <p> The subscription<ptr target="loc.02186_n1"/> has continued <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.03610.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> going on, in much the same course
                as previously, as you will see from the enclosed list. In the Athenaeum (&#38; I
                believe Academy) of 2 Jany a paragraph was put in, to serve as a reminder to any
                well-wishers: perhaps it may be expected that a few will respond, &#38; that we may
                then regard our little movement as wound up. I shall always esteem it a privilege to
                have borne my small share in testifying the respect &#38; gratitude to you <choice>

                    <expan>which</expan>
                </choice> are due to you (I might say) from all open-minded men &#38; women in the
                world&#8212;&#38; from the shut-minded too, for the matter of that. </p>
            <p> My wife &#38; children are <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03610.003_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> away at Ventnor (Isle of Wight), as the London winter threatened
                to be too much for my wife's delicate chest. I expect to join them within the next
                few days, staying away some 3 weeks or so. As I may be a little hurried the last
                remaining days, it is possible that I may not just now pay in the &#65505;33.16.6.
                shown in the enclosed list&#8212;assuming as I do that this point <choice>
