            <p>The pleasantest event since I last wrote has been a visit from Mr. Eldridge.<ptr target="loc.00944_n3"/> We had a long, friendly chat that did me good. Saturday evening we went to one of Miss Booth's<ptr target="n3017"/> receptions&#8212;met Joaquin Miller<ptr target="n0412"/> there, who is just back from Europe&#8212;of course we talked of you. Mrs. Moulton<ptr target="n0422"/> too is hoping so you will come to New York during her stay here, which is to last a week or two longer. John Burroughs<ptr target="n0129"/> has just sent me a post card to say he has returned from a 3-weeks stay with his folks in Delaware Co.&#8212;that he hopes to come here soon&#8212;wants Mrs. Burroughs<ptr target="prc.00047_n5"/> to come too &#38; board for a month or so&#8212;wants also "Walt to come&#8212;&#38; lecture"&#8212;but "Walt will not be hurried." Did I tell you that we found boarding here a young man, Mr. Arthur Holland, one of the family who were so very friendly to me &#38; made my stay so pleasant both in Concord &#38; Cambridge? He often comes to our room of an evening for an hour or two's chat, &#38; by the bye, being connected with the iron trade he has been able to make some enquiries for me as to what Per's<ptr target="n2000"/> chances as a scientific metallurgist would be in this country&#8212;&#38; I am sorry to say he thinks they would be very poor indeed. Prof. Lesley<ptr target="n0358"/> said the same thing; so it is clear I must not urge him to try the experiment, seeing he has a wife &#38; child. Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> &#38; Giddy<ptr target="n0890"/> both well. Love from us all. Good bye, Dear Friend.</p>
