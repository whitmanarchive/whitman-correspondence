            <p>As I know you would like to hear from me, my dear friend,<ptr target="pml.00011_n2"/> I will not yet go to bed&#8212;but sit down to write to you, that I have been here in Boston, to-day is a fortnight, and that my book is well under way. About a hundred and twenty pages are set up&#8212;it will probably make from six to seven hundred pages, and of a larger size than the last edition. It is to be very finely printed, good paper, and new, rather large-sized type. Thayer &amp; Eldridge,<ptr target="pml.00011_n3"/> the publishers, are a couple of young Yankees&#8212;so far very good specimens, to me, of this Eastern race of yours. They have treated me first rate&#8212;have not asked me at all what I was going to put into the book&#8212;just took me to the stereotype foundry, and given orders to follow my directions. It will be out in a month&#8212;a great relief to me to have the thing off my mind.</p>
            <p>I am more pleased with Boston than I anticipated. It is full of life, and criss-cross streets. I am very glad I [have] come, if only to rub out of me the deficient notions I had of New England character. I am getting to like it, every way&#8212;even the Yankee twang.</p>
            <p>Emerson called upon me immediately, treated me with the greatest courtesy&#8212;kept possession of me all day&#8212;gave me a bully dinner, &amp;c.<ptr target="pml.00011_n4"/>
I go on the Common&#8212;walk considerable in Washington street&#8212;and occupy about three hours a day at work in the printing office. All I have to do, is to read proofs. I wish you lived here&#8212;I should visit you regularly every day&#8212;probably twice a day. I create an immense sensation in Washington street. Every body here is so like everybody else&#8212;and I am Walt Whitman!&#8212;Yankee curiosity and cuteness, for once, is thoroughly stumped, confounded, petrified, made desperate.</p>
            <p>Let me see&#8212;have I any thing else to say to you? Indeed, what does it all amount to&#8212;this saying business? Of course I had better tear up this note&#8212;only I want to let you see how I cannot have forgotten you&#8212;sitting up here after half past 12, to write this precious document. I send my love to Helen and Emmy.</p>
