            </opener>

            <p>I have just rec'd the letter of the 10th—I sympathise deeply with those of you that have suffered with pains &amp; illness—but hope, from the wording of what you write, that it is now all over.</p>
                
            <p>Poor Emily—it must have been such agony—that kind of distress<ptr target="pml.00019_n3"/> 
                is about as severe as any thing can be, for human endurance—I hope Emily will try to go over, soon, and make a good call on Mother—</p>
            
            <p>Mother isn't well—she has rheumatism pretty bad—I am sorry to hear that Helen has attacks of sick head-ache—&amp; that you too have been unwell—I do hope you are now both of you well, &amp; may continue so.</p>
            
            <p>There is nothing important or new in my affairs here—I am still in the same Office—find my work mild &amp; agreeable, &amp; the place one remarkably well suited to a lazy, elderly, literary gentleman—</p>
            
            <p>The O'Connors are well as usual—They have to move, the end of this month. 
                Mr. Parker<ptr target="pml.00019_n4"/> wrote me, some time since, &amp; I have written an answer &amp; sent it.</p>
            
            <p>I still go to the Hospitals—always go Sunday afternoons.</p>
            
            <p>We are having a dark, cloudy, rainy time here, just now—not for a novelty—I have good health, &amp; good spirits. I send love to you &amp; Helen &amp; Emmy &amp; all, not forgetting Mr. Arnold—Remember me to Arthur, when you write—God give you health, in body &amp; in spirit—Farewell,</p>
