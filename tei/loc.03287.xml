                <salute>Dear Walt Whitman:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p> I wrote you several days ago asking you to tell me whether $100 was
                your lowest price. I think I said also that if you charged lower than that price I
                could sell a great many more articles for you than I could at these rates. I enclose
                a check for $60, which is payment for the article according to your own estimate of
                3,000 words, at the rate of $20 a thousand, which is the very highest rate they
                    pay.<ptr target="loc.03287_n1"/> I had to decide within ten minutes whether I
                would accept it or not, as Mr. Ferris, who is in <choice>
                    <sic>charce</sic>
                    <corr>charge</corr>
                </choice> of the syndicate, was just about to start for Mount McGregor. I told him,
                however, that if you refused to sell the article for less I should <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03287.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> consider myself
                responsible for the balance and expect payment for it either from him or from Mr.
                Rice.<ptr target="n6004"/></p>
            <p> So my dear old friend I have protected your interests to the best of my judgement and
                if you want me to follow orders and break owners in future let me know and I
                will do it. The great problem that the universe is asking you this moment is whether
                I am to regard this check as payment in full or payment on account. I also would 
                like you to answer my letters. I have no interest whatever in the syndicate to which
                I sold the manuscript. </p>
