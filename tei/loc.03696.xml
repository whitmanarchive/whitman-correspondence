            <p>Circumstances, Recollections, and an irresistable will I might say, induces me to write
                for the purpose of gratifying you and George<ptr target="n0700"/> as well as
                myself. I often see your name mentioned in the various papers, and I have your address in my
                Memorandum Book. Well now to the point. Let us recall your <hi rend="underline"

                yet can we not look back with somewhat of a hope that all was for the best, that we
                are blessed with light, with Fraternity, Charity &#38; Loyalty to all with Malice
                towards none, that it is a great pleasure for us, for you to hear from me, that you
                see I have a lingering appetite to let you and George know that I am still here in
                this mortal coil and that I desire a few lines from you, that we may at times
                through the great facilities of the present day correspond and now and
