        <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I received your welcome letter of Aug. 27th&#8212;and also 31st, enclosing Ned <choice>
          <orig>Stewarts</orig>
          <reg>Stewart's</reg>
        </choice><ptr target="loc.01529_n2"/>&#8212;When you write tell Ned I am here in Brooklyn,
        loafing around&#8212;&amp; that I send my love. Pete, there is nothing particular to write
        about this time&#8212;pretty much the same story&#8212;every day out on the bay awhile, or
        going down to Coney Island beach&#8212;and every day from two to four or five hours in the
        printing office&#8212;I still keep well &amp; hearty, &amp; the weather is fine&#8212;warm
        through the middle of the day, &amp; cool mornings &amp; nights&#8212;</p>

      <p>I fall in with quite a good many of my acquaintances of years ago<ptr target="loc.01529_n3"
        />&#8212;the young fellows, (now not so young)&#8212;that I knew intimately here before the
        war&#8212;some are dead&#8212;&amp; some have got married&#8212;&amp; some have grown
        rich&#8212;one of the latter I was up with yesterday &amp; last night&#8212;he has a big
        house on Fifth avenue&#8212;I was there to dinner (dinner at 8 p. m.!)&#8212;every thing in
        the loudest sort of style, with wines, silver, nigger waiters, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But
        my friend is just one of the manliest, jovialest best sort of fellows&#8212;no
        airs&#8212;&amp; just the one to suit you &amp; me&#8212;no women in the house&#8212;he is
        single&#8212;he wants me to make my home there&#8212;I shall not do that, but shall go there
        very frequently&#8212;the dinners &amp; good wines are attractive&#8212;then there is a fine
        library. </p>

      <p>Well, Pete, I am on the second month of my furlough&#8212;to think it is almost six weeks
        since we parted there that night&#8212;My dear loving boy, how much I want to see
        you&#8212;it seems a long while&#8212;I have rec'd a good letter from Mr. O'Connor,<ptr
          target="loc.01529_n4"/> &amp; also one from John Rowland<ptr target="loc.01529_n5"/> who
        is in the office for me. Nothing new in office&#8212;Well, Pete, about half our separation
        is over&#8212;the next six weeks will soon pass away&#8212;indeed it may be only four, as
        John Rowland told me he might wish to go away&#8212;</p>

      <p>Good bye for the present, my loving son, &amp; give my respects to any of the boys that ask
        about me. </p>
