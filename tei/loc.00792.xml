            <p>The noble gift of your brother Joseph P Davis<ptr target="loc.00792_n2"/> of [$20?] for the aid of the wounded, sick, dying soldiers
here came safe to hand&#8212;it is being sacredly distributed to
them&#8212;part of it has been so already&#8212;I may another time give
you special cases&#8212;I go every day or night in the hospitals a few
hours&#8212;<ptr target="loc.00792_n100"/>
         </p>
            <p>As to physical comforts, I attempt to have something&#8212;generally
a lot of&#8212;something harmless &amp; not too expensive to go round to
each man, even if it is nothing but a good home-made biscuit to each
man, or a couple of spoonfuls of blackberry preserve, I take a ward or
two of an evening &amp; two more next evening &amp;c&#8212;as an
addition to his supper&#8212;sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
(judgment of course has to be carefully used)&#8212;then, after such
general round, I fall back upon the main thing, after all, the special
cases, alas, too common&#8212;those that need special attention, some
little delicacy, some trifle&#8212;very often, far above all else,
soothing kindness wanted&#8212;personal magnetism&#8212;poor boys, their
sick hearts &amp; wearied &amp; exhausted bodies hunger for the
sustenance of love or their deprest spirits must be cheered up&#8212;I
find often young men, some hardly more than children in age yet&#8212;so
good, so sweet, so brave, so decorous, I could not feel them nearer to
me if my own sons or young brothers&#8212;Some cases even I could not
tell any one, how near to me, from their yearning ways &amp; their
sufferings&#8212;it is comfort &amp; delight to me to minister to them,
to sit by them&#8212;some so wind themselves around one's heart, &amp;
will be kissed at parting at night just like children&#8212;though
veterans of two years of battles &amp; camp life&#8212;</p>
            <p>I always carry a haversack with some articles most
wanted&#8212;physical comforts are a sort of basis&#8212;I distribute
nice large biscuit, sweet-crackers, sometimes cut up a lot of peaches
with sugar, give preserves of all kinds, jellies, &amp;c. tea, oysters,
butter, condensed milk, plugs of tobacco, (I am the only one that doles
out this last, &amp; the men have grown to look to me)&#8212;wine,
brandy, sugar, pickles, letter-stamps, envelopes &amp; note-paper, the
morning papers, common handkerchiefs &amp; napkins, undershirts, socks,
dressing gowns, &amp; fifty other things<ptr target="loc.00792_n3"/>&#8212;I have lots of special little requests. Frequently I
give small sums of money&#8212;shall do so with your brother's
contribution&#8212;the wounded are very frequently brought &amp; lay
here a long while without a cent. I have been here &amp; in front 9
months doing this thing, &amp; have learned much&#8212;two-thirds of the
soldiers are from 15 to 25 or 6 years of age&#8212;lads of 15 or 16 more
frequent than you have any idea&#8212;seven-eighths of the Army are
Americans, our own stock&#8212;the foreign element in the army is much
overrated, &amp; is of not much account anyhow&#8212;As to these
hospitals, (there are dozens of them in [&amp;] around Washington)
[there] are no hospitals you must understand like the diseased
half-foreign collections under that name common at all times in
cities&#8212;in these here, the noblest, cleanest stock I think of the
world, &amp; the most precious.<ptr target="loc.00792_n4"/>
