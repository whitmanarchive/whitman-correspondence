            <p>I have been thinking very often of you lately, and wishing that something might be
                done to lighten life for you. The nation is deeply in your debt for the services you
                rendered in the war, not to mention its deeper debt to you as a poet which will be
                appreciated more and more as the years go on. Hon. Henry B. Lovering,<ptr target="n4250"/> the Member of
                Congress from my district, 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Massachusetts, and influential member of committee
                on invalid pensions, tells me that you are fully entitled to a pension and that he
                will be very glad to be<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_es.00086.jpg" type="verso"/>
                instrumental in securing it, as he has a high appreciation for you. He would not
                like to do it, however, without consulting your wishes in the matter, and therefore
                I write to ask if I may not tell him to go ahead. The act would be purely voluntary
                on the part of Congress, and not in response to any petition from you.</p>
            <p>Some of us, friends of yours here, are proposing to organize, on a broad and simple
                basis, a Whitman Society, to promote an interest in and study of your works. I
                believe it may accomplish much good. I have seen Kennedy<ptr target="n3039"/>
                several times lately, and hope his work on you will secure a good publisher. Have
                also seen Boyle O'Reilly,<ptr target="n4973"/> Bartlett,<ptr target="n4959"/> Arlo
                Bates,<ptr target="n4251"/> Dr. Wesselhaeft<ptr target="n3142"/> and Mrs.
                Fairchild<ptr target="har.00049_n3"/>, all staunch friends of yours.<pb

            <p>Did you know that we have a town called Whitman in Massachusetts now. It was formerly
                South Abington, and its name was changed last winter. It is in the Old Colony, the part of the
                country where your first American ancestors lived. I do not know for whom it was
                named, but to many it will recall the most eminent member of the family.</p>
            <p>In the December number of <hi rend="underline">The Path</hi>, a magazine published in
                New York, is one of a series of articles on "Poetical Occultism."<ptr target="loc.06008_n1"/> This one is devoted to some of your poems and is partly
                written by me, partly by my friend W. Q. Judge.<ptr target="n4253"/> I will have a copy sent you.</p>
