            <p>In the name of <hi rend="underline">Calamus</hi> listen to me! Before me hangs your beautiful <hi rend="underline">photograph</hi>, twice precious, since it is your gift to me.

            <p>May I not thank you for your picture and your letter? May I not tell you over and over that where I go <choice><sic>your</sic><corr>you</corr></choice> go with me, in poem and picture and the little vol of notes also, for I read and reread trying to see you in the flesh as I so long to see you!</p>

            <p>I wrote you last from the Sandwich Islands. I shall before long be even farther from you than ever for I think of sailing towards Tahiti in about five weeks.</p>

            <p>There is much truth in it and I am praying that you may like it a little. If I could only know that it has pleased you I should bless my stars fervantly.</p>
            
            <p>I have been in vain trying to buy from our Library a copy of your "Leaves" <choice><abbr>Edt.</abbr><expan>Edition</expan></choice> of 1855—I think it your first &amp; I have somewhere read that you set the type for it yourself—Is it true? Do you think I could obtain a copy of it by addressing some Eastern publisher or book seller?</p>

<p>You say you "don't write many letters". O, if you would only reply to this within the month! I could then go into the South Seas feeling sure of your friendship and I should try to <choice><sic>life</sic><corr>live</corr></choice> the real life there for your sake as well as for my own.</p>
            
            <p>Forgive me if I have wearied you: I will be silent and thoughtful in future, but in any case know, dear friend that I am grateful for your indulgence.</p>
