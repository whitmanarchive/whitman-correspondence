            <p>Since I last wrote to you my illness has been gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual&#8212;I keep pretty old-fashioned hours, rise early, dine at 1, &amp; go to bed before 10&#8212;My head feels clear &amp; comfortable, &amp; my strength has returned almost, but not quite up to what it was. I rec'd Nelly's letter, I could not get over to New York that afternoon&#8212;Nelly, my dear friend, you must excuse me&#8212;I wished much to see you, too<ptr target="nyp.00191_n2"/>&#8212;I hope you are having a good time &amp; feeling well physically &amp; in good spirits&#8212;&amp; the little one, little Jenny, this line is for you, my dear. I hope you too are well&#8212;William, I rec'd the volume of Navy Reports, transactions of iron clads, fights, &amp;c. for '62 &amp; '3<ptr target="nyp.00191_n3"/>&#8212;it will probably give me material for some pieces, thumb-nail sketches, for my "<hi rend="italic">Drum Taps</hi>"&#8212;I take it you had that in view in sending it to me&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am trying to make arrangements to publish my volume&#8212;I shall probably try to bring [it] out myself, stereotype it, &amp; print an edition of 500&#8212;I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn &amp; New York in three weeks.</p>
            <p>I rec'd Charles Eldridge's last letter&#8212;so he is to go down to front again &#8212;how I wish I was in Washington to go with him &amp; Major&#8212;I should try it as I am, &amp; be glad of the chance&#8212;O I almost forgot the big raid&#8212;it is already a thing of the past, I find by my own thoughts &amp; memory, but I suppose it would not do to write a letter to Washington so soon &amp; not mention it&#8212;</p>
            <p>We have heard from my brother George up to the 18th inst.<ptr target="nyp.00191_n4"/>&#8212;he was living &amp; well up to that time&#8212;At home here all well as usual&#8212;Mother's age I think begins to just show&#8212;in a few weeks, she will commence her 70th year&#8212;still she does most of her light housework&#8212;My sister &amp; her children are well&#8212;(Nelly, I write these particulars for you)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, William, about the war I have to inform you that I remain hopeful &amp; confident yet<ptr target="nyp.00191_n5"/>&#8212;I still think Grant will go into Richmond&#8212;My brother describes the spirit of the troops as confident &amp; sanguine under all their trials&#8212;I wish you to enclose this in your next letter to Nelly&#8212;I wish you to give my remembrance &amp; love to the Howells,<ptr target="nyp.00191_n6"/> to Miss Howard<ptr target="nyp.00191_n7"/> &amp; to Arnold Johnson<ptr target="nyp.00191_n8"/>&#8212;Write soon &amp; tell me all the news&#8212;tell me how is Ashton&#8212;Good bye &amp; God bless you, my dear friend&#8212;</p>
