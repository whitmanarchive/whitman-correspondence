                <salute>Respected and Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>You will doubtless be surprised at the receipt of this letter. I will briefly state
                the causes which lead me to write it.</p>

            <p>A fortnight ago to-day, I was visiting the Brigade Camp of volunteers, then
                stationed at London East. I there recognized you, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                Whitman as the original of a portrait published several years ago, in an issue of
                Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.</p>
            <p>You may possibly recollect me as the young person with whom you exchanged a few words
                on that day, respecting <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="man_ej.00215_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="man_ej.00216_large.jpg" type="recto"/>the Huron 
                Co. Battalion and particularly about that portion of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">their</unclear> head-gear named
                    'Havelocks'.
                Subsequently I had the honor of receiving a recognition from you, and believe me,
                the compliment, though perhaps undeserved, was duly appreciated and treasured as a
                happy recollection.</p>

            <p>Not content with this however, I have resolved, not without misgivings as to its propriety, to write
                to you, respectfully requesting by way of answer, a few words of advice, suitable to
                a young person (myself&#8212;22 <choice><abbr>yrs</abbr><expan>years</expan></choice> old to-day) desirous of embracing Literature as a
                profession. Report relates many incidents to show the desire you express of aiding,
                by the help of your genius, many with whom you come in contact and I am <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002v" facs="man_ej.00133_large.jpg" type="verso"/>all the more
                willing to believe these reports, when I read in your poetry the lessons that teach
                the sublimity of Friendship the pathos of human sympathy, and the power that one man
                may wield over the destinies of another.</p>
            <p>Earnestly hoping that you will honor my desire,</p>

            <closer>
                <salute>I remain very faithfully yours,</salute>
