            <p>I write you a few lines to let you know that I have come home on a month's furlough&#8212;there is nothing very new or special with me. I am still employed in the Attorney Gen'l's office, &amp; shall return there before the middle of next month. I often think about you, &amp; wish it was so we could have each others society frequently&#8212;Byron,<ptr target="med.00313_n2"/> I don't know certain whether I have written to you since I rec'd your last letter or not&#8212;but it came safe, &amp; was glad to hear from you&#8212;write soon, my dear comrade, &amp; direct your letter to me, Portland Av. near Myrtle, Brooklyn, New York.<ptr target="med.00313_n3"/> Soon as I get back to Washington, I will send you word.</p>
            <p>Here in this place &amp; New York, I go around quite a good deal&#8212;it is a great excitement to go around the busiest parts of New York, Broadway, &amp; the wharves, &amp; great ferries&#8212;The oceans of people, the trucks &amp; omnibuses, go all jammed together, &amp; such bustle &amp; noise&#8212;I like it much for a few hours now and then&#8212;but don't want to be continually in it&#8212;I have made an addition to the little book "Drum Taps,"<ptr target="med.00313_n4"/> &amp; will send you one of the perfect copies soon&#8212;we had a fine long pouring rain here all last night&#8212;I am writing this home at my mother's, in the front basement sitting by the stove, as the weather is cool&#8212;Mother is absent at Burlington, Vt, but returns to-morrow&#8212;the others have gone to church, etc&#8212;so I am entirely alone to-day&#8212;so I thought I couldn't do better than write to you. Dear comrade, I hope you are well &amp; doing well&#8212;write soon, boy&#8212;from your loving friend and comrade&#8212;</p>
