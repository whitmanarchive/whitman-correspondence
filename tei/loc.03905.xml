                <salute/>Dear friend</opener>

            <p>The days go along with me pretty much after the old sort, though I <choice>
                    <sic>dont</sic>
                    <corr>don't</corr>
                </choice> get my strength yet, nor feel as well as I did in the fall &amp; early
                winter&#8212;I busy myself writing some &amp; reading a little&#8212;am doing quite
                well with my books, &amp; have been all winter&#8212;when the weather permits I try
                to get out, but my strength soon fails me&#8212;has been so now five or six weeks
                &amp; gets no better, but I am in hopes things will take a turn&#8212;</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_jc.00502_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Has been a pleasant Sunday here, coolish but sunny and calm&#8212;O how I wished I
                could put in the whole day down at G&#8212;but I think of coming down next Friday to
                stay two or three days at any rate&#8212;a friend of mine here about my age, died
                suddenly yesterday, Judge Woodhall&#8212;I thought him the best man in
                Camden&#8212;do you know Mrs Gilchrist has been very sick indeed, five or six
                months? &amp; is not over it yet&#8212;I got a long letter from her last
                week&#8212;Susan I am afraid this is not a very lively letter&#8212;I have just had
                my supper, &amp; feel as <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jc.00503_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/>well as usual, &amp; have no trouble particular to worry me, but I
                am sitting here up in my room alone, &amp; have been all day, &amp; feel kind of
                dull &amp; companionless&#8212;</p>
            <p>Susan I suppose you got the letter I sent you about
                twelve days ago&#8212;I also sent one to Harry about a week ago which he has not
                yet acknowledged&#8212;Well it is &#189; past 8, &amp; the moon is shining, &amp; I
                will go out &amp; put this miserable letter in the box, &amp; then take a few
                minutes walk around, &amp; see if it makes me feel any livelier&#8212;How is George
                getting along?&#8212;Harry told me he <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_jc.00504_large.jpg" type="verso"/>was having a pretty good
                winter&#8212;has he drunk up the little bottle of Whiskey? Well there wasn't more
                than two or three good drinks any how&#8212;I shall be down next Friday in the
                4&#189; afternoon train to Kirkwood, if it don't storm pretty bad</p>
