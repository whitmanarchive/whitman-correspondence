            <p>The 14th of Brooklyn have lost very heavy  among the killed are Captains Davey and Mallery.<ptr target="duk.00326_n2"/>  Joe Grummond<ptr target="duk.00326_n3"/> is wounded in the leg. I saw Joe a short time before he was hit and after he was wounded he was carried through the lines of our Regt. It was very discouraging to us as we lay on the hill to see hundreds of men leave their regiments without being hurt at all and some 2 or 300 wounded were either carried or walked through our ranks going to the rear. I think we was completely out generald<ptr target="duk.00326_n4"/>  the most of our men was good enough but I think that they was badly handled. Mother I have just received a letter from you dated August 16th which is the only word I have had from home since we left Fredericksburg. We shall probably encamp here for a few days to recruit up a little and I hope you will write to me as soon as you get this. Mother do not feel the least uneaisiness about me as I never was heartier or ruggeder in my life. I am getting tired so good bye to all  I will write again soon<ptr target="duk.00326_n5"/>
