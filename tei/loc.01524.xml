        <salute>Dear Pete,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Dear son, I received your second letter to&#8211;day, also the Star. I sent you a letter
        Tuesday evening, which I suppose you have received. As I am now sitting in my room &amp;
        have no desire to go to bed yet, I will commence another. Give my best respects to George
          Smith<ptr target="loc.01524_n2"/>&#8212;also to Pensey Bell &amp; his brother George<ptr
          target="loc.01524_n3"/>&#8212;also to Mr. Shedd<ptr target="loc.01524_n4"/>&#8212;and in
        fact to all my railroad friends, whenever they inquire after me&#8212;</p>

      <p>Dear son, I can almost see you drowsing &amp; nodding since last Sunday, going home
        late&#8212;especially as we wait there at 7th st. and I am telling you something deep about
        the heavenly bodies&#8212;&amp; in the midst of it I look around &amp; find you fast asleep,
        &amp; your head on my shoulder like a chunk of wood&#8212;an awful compliment to my
        lecturing powers. All the talk here now is either the war on the Rhine,<ptr
          target="loc.01524_n5"/> or the murder of old Mr. Nathan,<ptr target="loc.01524_n6"/> or
        some other murder&#8212;for there are plenty of them&#8212;I send you a couple of papers
        with pieces about them. Say whether they come safe. </p>

      <p>I believe that is all for to&#8211;night, as it is getting late&#8212;Good night,
        Pete&#8212;Good night, my darling son&#8212;here is a kiss for you, dear boy&#8212;on the
        paper here&#8212;a good long one&#8212;</p>

      <p>Thursday&#8212;4th&#8212;I have been out all the forenoon &amp; until about 2
        o'clock&#8212;had some business in New York, which I attended, then came back &amp; spent an
        hour &amp; a half on the river, with one of the pilots, a particular friend of
        mine&#8212;saw the yachts, several of them, including the America out practising, for the
        great race that comes off Monday<ptr target="loc.01524_n7"/>&#8212;the Dauntless was out
        yesterday&#8212;&amp; the Cambria went down three days ago&#8212;the America is the
        handsomest little craft I ever laid eyes on&#8212;I also saw Henry Ward Beecher<ptr
          target="loc.01524_n8"/> &amp; had some talk with him&#8212;I find myself going with the
        pilots muchly&#8212;there are several that were little boys, now grown up, &amp; remember me
        well&#8212;fine hearty fellows&#8212;always around the water&#8212;sons of old
        pilots&#8212;they make much of me&#8212;&amp; of course I am willing&#8212;</p>

      <p><hi rend="italic">10 o'clock at night</hi>&#8212;As this is lying here on my table to be
        sent off tomorrow, I will imagine you with your arm around my neck saying Good night,
        Walt&#8212;&amp; me&#8212;Good night, Pete&#8212;</p>

      <p><hi rend="italic">Friday morning Aug 5</hi>. All well&#8212;fine weather &amp; I feel in
        good spirits&#8212;I am just going out, &amp; across to New York. </p>

        <p>We had a heavy shower here yesterday afternoon, 4th&#8212;the weather is not too hot
          here. </p>
