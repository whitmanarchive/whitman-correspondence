               <salute>Dear mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>So the mob has risen at last in New York<ptr target="loc.00777_n1"/>&#8212;I have been expecting it, but as the day for the draft had arrived &amp; every thing was so quiet, I supposed all might go on smoothly&#8212;but it seems the passions of the people were only sleeping, &amp; have burst forth with terrible fury, &amp; they have destroyed life &amp; property, the enrolment buildings &amp;c as we hear&#8212;the accounts we get are a good deal in a muddle, but it seems bad enough&#8212;the feeling here is savage &amp; hot as fire against New York, (the mob&#8212;"<hi rend="italic">copperhead mob</hi>" the papers here call it,) &amp; I hear nothing in all directions but threats of ordering up the gunboats, cannonading the city, shooting down the mob, hanging them in a body, &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;meantime I remain silent, partly amused, partly scornful, or occasionally put a dry remark, which only adds fuel to the flame&#8212;I do not feel it in my heart to abuse the poor people, or call for rope or bullets for them, but that is all the talk here, even in the hospitals&#8212;</p>
            <p>The acc'ts from N Y this morning are that the gov't has ordered the draft to be suspended there&#8212;I hope it is true, for I find that the deeper they go in with the draft, the more trouble it is likely to make&#8212;I have changed my opinions &amp; feelings on the subject&#8212;we are in the midst of strange &amp; terrible times&#8212;one is pulled a dozen different ways in his mind, &amp; hardly knows what to think or do&#8212;Mother, I have not much fear that the troubles in New York will affect any of our family, still I feel somewhat uneasy&#8212;about Jeff, if any one, as he is more around&#8212;I have had it much on my mind what could be done, if it should so happen that Jeff should be drafted&#8212;of course he could not go, without its being the downfall almost of our whole family, as you may say, Mat &amp; his young ones, &amp; a sad blow to you too, mother, &amp; to all&#8212;I didn't see any other way than to try to raise the $300, mostly by borrowing if possible of Mr Lane&#8212;mother, I have no doubt I shall make a few hundred dollars by the lectures I shall certainly commence soon, (for my hospital missionary purposes &amp; my own, for that purpose) &amp; I could lend that am't to Jeff to pay it back&#8212;May be the draft will not come off after all&#8212;I should say it was very doubtful if they can carry it out in N Y &amp; Brooklyn&#8212;&amp; besides it is only one chance out of several, to be drawn if it does&#8212;I dont wonder dear brother Jeff feels the effect it would have on domestic affairs. I think it is right to feel so, full as strongly as a man can. I do hope all will go well, &amp; without such an additional trouble falling upon us, but as it can be met with money, I hope Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all of you, dear mother, will not worry any more about it&#8212;I wrote to Jeff a few lines last Sunday, I suppose he got<ptr target="loc.00777_n2"/>&#8212;Mother, I don't know whether you have had a kind of gloomy week the past week, but somehow I feel as if you all had, but I hope it has passed over&#8212;How is dear sister Mat, &amp; how is Miss Mannahatta &amp; little black head&#8212;I sometimes feel as if I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come home &amp; see you all, I want to very much&#8212;</p>
            <p>My hospital life still continues the same&#8212;I was in Armory all day yesterday &amp; day &amp; night before&#8212;they have the men wounded in the railroad accident at Laurel station (bet[ween] here &amp; Baltimore) about 30 soldiers, some of them horribly injured at 3 o'clock a m last Saturday by collision&#8212;poor, poor, poor men&#8212;I go again this afternoon &amp; night&#8212;I see so much of butcher sights, so much sickness &amp; suffering I must get away a while I believe for self preservation&#8212;I have felt quite well though the past week&#8212;we have had rain continually&#8212;Mother, I have not heard from George since, have you? I shall write Han to-day &amp; send George's letter&#8212;if you or Jeff has not written this week I hope Jeff will write on receiving this. Good bye for present, dearest mother, &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat.</p>

         <postscript>
            <p>Mother, the army is to be paid off two months more, right away. Of course George will get two months more pay. Dear mother, I hope you will keep untouched &amp; put in bank every cent you can. I want us to have a ranch somewhere by or before next spring.</p>
