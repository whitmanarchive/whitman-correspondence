            <p>I have just sent the MS back by Adams express, same address as this letter.</p>
            <p>You will be surprised, probably enraged, at the manner in which I have gone through
                it&#8212;</p>
            <p>Upon first looking over it I was divided between two courses&#8212;whether to send it
                back without revision at all&#8212;or to go over it <hi rend="italic">with
                    decision</hi> making all the corrections &#38; changes I felt entirely clear of.
                After deliberating I decided on the latter&#8212;I have acted upon it.</p>
            <p>Without explaining each particular point of elision or addition, I will only say that
                I am convinced if you accept &#38; print this copy as now arranged, you will bless
                your stars afterward&#8212;(printed in the old shape it would have turned out ill,
                and in very many things would probably have been unendorsed by you, as it certainly
                would by me.)</p>
            <p>The character you give me is not a true one in the main&#8212;I am by no means that
                benevolent, equable, happy creature you <choice>
                    <orig>pourtray</orig><reg>portray</reg></choice>&#8212;but let that pass&#8212;I have left it as you wrote.</p>
            <p>You will see what I have substituted for your argument on the sexual theme. Upon
                looking it over (pages 166 to 168) after an interval I am satisfied with it, and am
                willing to let those sections of my poems stand or fall on its support.<ptr
                    target="upa.00200_n2"/></p>
            <p>I am sure as I can be all of those elaborated and lengthy parts from <hi
                    rend="italic">Man's Moral Nature</hi> should be ruled out of this book &#38;
                referred to their own volume, where they are magnificent, (but an intrusion and
                superfluity here).<ptr target="upa.00200_n3"/> The whole MS. was far, far far too
                redundant&#8212;some things were often repeated three or four times&#8212;several
                long passages (very likely those you had set your heart on) were very much better
                out than in. Others would have been nuts to the caricature baboons&#8212;There were
                many errors or half-errors of fact.</p>
            <p>But there is enough to make a very creditable, serviceable book&#8212;a permanent
                storehouse of many biographic, personal &#38; other things, and of your glowing
                &#38; penetrating criticism&#8212;</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it will justify itself, and (as I have corrected it if you accept)
                will endure the test of both [readers?] &#38; the best critics of one, ten or fifty
                years hence&#8212;which is the main thing.</p>
            <p>Although the MS as it comes back may seem <hi rend="italic">in a state</hi> to your
                eyes, I assure you that the printers could take it just as it is, (all numbered with
                the folios in blue pencil) and get along with ease.</p>
            <p>Finally as all the excised pages of the MS are returned (&#38; though it will need
                considerable writing &amp;c.) it can be restored entirely to the original form, if
                you should decide to do so.</p>
