            <p>I have just written a postal to your folks to say I wouldn't be down till Saturday afternoon (Ashland Station) &#38; I thought I would write you a line&#8212;Every thing goes well with me these times considering&#8212;health &#38; feelings better since I come back from Canada than for nine years past&#8212;(one of the ferry men told me he heard a lady say to another on the boat yesterday as I went off, "He looks older &#38; savager than ever, dont he? but there is a something&#8212;I dont wonder that Aleck is all taken up with him" &#38;c &#38;c&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Aleck</hi>, the ferry man thought, was her husband)&#8212;</p>

            <p>I am selling quite a good many of my books now<ptr target="nyp.00416_n1"/>&#8212;gives me something to do every day&#8212;so you see I have enough to put me in quite a good humor. Then upon going to look where I had my bound books boxed &#38; stored away, up in the garret at Mr. Scovel's, (I hadn't been to look after them in three years)&#8212;I found them not only in good condition but found I had twice as many as I calculated&#8212;yesterday I had the express man to bring two boxes of 'em home, &#38; left three boxes there still. I got a letter from the PM General, Canada<ptr target="nyp.00416_n2"/>&#8212;the missing letter not there&#8212;I am convinced it came to Haddonfield&#8212;</p>

            <p>I have just had my dinner &#38; am up here in my third story room finishing this&#8212;it is a bright sunny day here, after the three days' storm&#8212;I have been alone all day, but busy &#38; contented&#8212;my room is just right for all the year except the very hottest months&#8212;the sun pours in here so nice, especially afternoons&#8212;I wish you was here to-day, Hank (I havn't got any <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> though)&#8212;I see Hoag<ptr target="nyp.00416_n3"/> yesterday, &#38; Seigfried too&#8212;every body is flying around&#8212;Election excitement now, very hot.
