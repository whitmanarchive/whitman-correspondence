                &amp; have some pretty bad ones yet, mostly with my head&#8212;&amp; my leg is about 
                as useless as ever&#8212;still I am decidedly no worse, &amp; I think now I am even <hi rend="underline">getting better</hi>&#8212;it is slow, &amp; with great alternations&#8212;but I have the feeling of getting more strength, 
                &amp; easier in the head, more like myself&#8212;something like what I was before mother's death&#8212;I cannot be reconciled to that yet&#8212;it is the great <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01748.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                
                cloud of my life&#8212;nothing that ever 
                happened before has had such an effect on me&#8212;but I shall get well, yet, dear son, 
                probably, (of course not certainly) and be back in Washington this fall, 
                &amp; we will be together again. I think I am now about as I was the day 
                you came down to Baltimore depot with me, 20th May I think

                get down to the ferry boat, &amp; cross to Philadelphia&#8212;so you see I am not

                (which will be soon) I shall be better off in Washington, as it is very lonesome to me here,
