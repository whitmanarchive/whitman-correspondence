            <p>I ought to have written to you before, acknowledging the good package of books, duly received by express, &amp; actively used since, changing them around in places where most needed among the soldiers&#8212;(I found a small hospital of U. S. teamsters, entirely without reading, I go there considerable, &amp; have given them largely of your reading contribution)&#8212;I am down here pretty well toward the extreme front of the Army, eight or ten miles south of headquarters, (Brandy Station)&#8212;We had some fighting here, below here on picket lines, day before yesterday&#8212;We feared they, the rebs, were advancing upon us in our depleted condition, especially feared their making a flank movement up on our right. We were all ready to skedaddle from here last night, &amp; expected it&#8212;horses harnessed in all directions, &amp; traps packed up, (we have held &amp; lost Culpepper three or four times already)&#8212;but I was very sleepy &amp; laid down &amp; went to sleep, never slept fresher or sweeter&#8212;but orders came during the night to stay for the present, there was no danger&#8212;during the night I heard tremendous yells, I got up &amp; went out, &amp; found it was some of the men returning from the extreme front&#8212;As day before yesterday a strong force, three corps, were moved down there&#8212;These were portions of them now returning&#8212;it was a curious sight to see the shadowy columns coming in two or three o'clock at night&#8212;I talked with the men&#8212;how good, how cheerful, how full of manliness &amp; good nature our American young men are&#8212;I staid last night at the house of a real secesh woman, Mrs. Ashby&#8212;her husband (dead) a near relation of the famous reb Gen Ashby<ptr target="med.00305_n2"/>&#8212;she gave me a good supper &amp; bed&#8212;There was quite a squad of our officers there&#8212;she &amp; her sister paid me the compliment of talking friendlily &amp; nearly altogether exclusively with me&#8212;she was dressed in very faded clothes but her manners were fine, seems to be a travelled educated woman&#8212;quite melancholy&#8212;said she had remained through fearful troubles &amp; changes here on acct of her children&#8212;she is a handsome middle-aged woman&#8212;poor lady, how I pitied her, compelled to live as one may say on chance &amp; charity, with her high spirit&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear friend, I am moving around here among the field hospitals&#8212;(O how the poor young men suffer)&#8212;&amp; to see more of camp life &amp; war scenes, &amp; the state of the army this winter&#8212;Dear friend, I have much to tell you, but must abruptly close&#8212;</p>
