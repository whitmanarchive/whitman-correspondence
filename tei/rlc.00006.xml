            <p>I have sent you some books by Mr. Clausen<ptr target="rlc.00006_n2"/>—All the real flavor of American fun resides in its <hi rend="italic">idioms</hi>, which are untranslatable expressions of elements in the places, people, &amp; <hi rend="italic">nativities</hi> here—perceptible enough here, but in the nature of things invisible &amp; inaudible to a foreigner—The extracts I enclose will illustrate—<ptr target="rlc.00006_n3"/></p>
            
            <p>Mr. Clausen started for Denmark last Saturday, June 1st.</p>
            
            <p>I am just having your criticism <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> rendered into English—I am to obtain possession of it next Thursday<ptr target="rlc.00006_n4"/>—From what I get of it, in advance, it is going to prove the grandest response &amp; praise yet given anywhere to me &amp; my poems. I rec'd the newspaper. I shall keep you advised of any printed use made of your criticism in this country—(The brief of the N. Y. <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi>, has been copied in the papers somewhat.)</p>
            
            <p>From the 10th of June to 10th of July I shall be home in Brooklyn, New York, &amp; then return here again—</p>
            
            <p>We are in the midst of the preparations &amp; canvassing for one of our national elections—the election is next November—(for President for the term from March 4, 1873, to March 4, 1877)—There is nothing very radical or important in the political questions—it is mostly an excitement of personal piques, &amp; for the <hi rend="italic">spoils</hi>, as we call it, (i.e. the pay &amp; perquisites of office)—</p>
            
            <p>One of our great <hi rend="italic">nominating Conventions</hi> is just now meeting, (at Philadelphia)<ptr target="rlc.00006_n5"/>—You would enjoy the sight of such a spectacle greatly—there are many hundreds of <hi rend="italic">delegates</hi>, and many thousands of active interested followers. (All <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi>—all perfectly good natured)—such talking, such gesticulation, such immense crowds by day &amp; night—such manoevering by the different coteries, for their favorite men, (to get "the nomination")—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—It is all very salutary exercise for the bulk of the people. But the <hi rend="italic">spectacular</hi> part of the scenes is the best, especially at night—many bands of music—</p>
