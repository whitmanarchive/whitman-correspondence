            </opener>

            <p>We have been back from Roxbury some weeks,<!--<ptr target="n0129"/>--> and thoroughly at
                ease again in our old shoes. I am thinking every day how much I should enjoy a visit
                from you and what good times we could have. What do you say? Can you not be
                persuaded to turn your face and steps this way? I could arrange it so you could
                spend the summer here if you would. We shall probably be away in July and August,
                but there is a family in the other house with whom you could board as cheaply
                as you do in Camden. The young man is a good fellow and keeps our school, and the
                daughter is a sweet girl. The mother is a widow and a good beautiful woman. I think
                you would enjoy yourself here. If you preferred you could have your bed here in my
                shanty&#8212;a large comfortable room on the brink of the hill, fifty yards from the
                house, where my books and papers are, and where I spend most of my time. Drop me a
                line if you will come and when.</p>

            <p>I am feeling pretty well. Julian<!--<ptr target="n0898"/>--> grows finely. His mind runs
                much in strange channels. He has already got to the point where he wants to know who
                made God. One day he asked me who took care of the first pair of birds&#8212;"the
                first little birds what had no papa nor mama." Yesterday as he lay here on the sofa
                in a brown study, he said: "Papa, the Heaven-world owns this world."</p>

            <p>My Carlyle<!--<ptr target="n0139"/>--> article goes into the August Century. I am adding a
                page about Mrs. C. as revealed by her letters. How about Dr. Bucke's<!--<ptr
                    target="n0119"/>--> book?<!--<ptr target="med.00638_n5"/>--> I hear nothing. How is Jenny
                    O'Connor?<!--<ptr target="n0774"/>--> Kindest remembrances to George and his wife.<!--<ptr
                    target="n1046"/>--></p>
