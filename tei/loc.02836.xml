      </opener>

      <p>Your two letters including the cheque for £25 reached me, for which accept deepest thanks.<ptr target="loc.02836_n2"/> I have already written you my approval of your three communications in the L[ondon] D[aily] News<ptr target="loc.02836_n3"/> &amp; will [say] that in my opinion (&amp; now with fullest deliberation reäffirming it) <hi rend="italic">all the points assumed 
        as facts on which your letter of March 13 is grounded, are substantially true, &amp; most of them are true 
        to the minutest particular</hi>&#8212;as far as could be stated in a one column letter.
      </p>
      
      <p>Then let me quite definitely explain myself, about one or two things. I should not have instigated this English move, 
        &amp; if I had been consulted,<ptr target="loc.02836_n4"/> should have peremptorily <choice><orig status="unremarkable">stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice> it&#8212;but now that it has started, &amp; grown, and under the circumstances, 
        &amp; by the person, &amp; in the spirit, (&amp; especially as I can &amp; will give, to each generous donor, my book,
        portrait, autograph, myself as it were)&#8212;I am determined to respond to it in the same spirit in which it has 
        risen&#8212;to accept most thankfully, cordially &amp; unhesitatingly all that my friends feel to convey to me, 
        which determination I here deliberately express once for all. This you are at liberty to make known to all 
        who feel any interest in the matter.
      </p>
      
      <p>The situation at present may be briefly &amp; candidly told. I am, &amp; have for three years during my paralysis, 
        been boarding here, with a relative, comfortable &amp; nice enough, but steadily paying just the same as at an inn&#8212;and 
        the whole affair in precisely the same business spirit. My means would by this time have entirely given out, 
        but that have been temporarily replenished from sales of my new edition and as now by this most welcome present 
        &amp; purchase&#8212;the £25 herein acknowledged.
      </p>
      
      <p>Though without employment, means or income, you augur truly that I am not in what may be called pinching want&#8212;nor do I anticipate it.
      </p>
      
      <p> My object I may say farther has lately been &amp; still is to build a cheap little<ptr target="loc.02836_n5"/> three or four room house on a little lot I own in a rural skirt 
        of this town&#8212;for a nook, where I can haul in &amp; eke out in a sort of independent economy &amp; comfort 
        &amp; as satisfactorily as may be the rest of my years&#8212;for I may live several of them yet. To attain this, 
        would be quite a triumph, &amp; I feel assured I could then live very nicely indeed on the income from my books.
      </p>
      
      <p>I shall (as I see now) continue to be my own publisher &amp; bookseller. Accept all subscriptions to the New Edition. 
        All will be supplied upon remittance. There are Two Volumes. Leaves of Grass, 384 pages, poems, $5, has two portraits. 
        Then <hi rend="italic">Two Rivulets</hi>, poems &amp; prose, (including "<hi rend="italic">Memoranda of the War</hi>")
        with photos, altogether 359 pages&#8212;also 
        $5. Each book has my autograph. The Two Volumes are my complete works, $10 the set.
      </p>
      
      <p>I wish the particular address of each generous friend given, so as he or she can be reach'd by mail 
        or express&#8212;either with the autographic volume <hi rend="italic">Two Rivulets</hi>, or a complete set of my works in Two Volumes, 
        with autograph &amp; portraits, or some other of my books. It may be some while before the books arrive, 
        but they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> arrive in time.<ptr target="loc.02836_n6"/>
