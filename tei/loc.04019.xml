                <salute/>Dear Mont</opener>

            <p>I have come on here (about 500 miles further) &amp; am stopping in this city for a few
                days situated very comfortably &amp; feeling pretty well&#8212;the journey is doing
                me good, for I lay quite sick in London about three weeks. I am better, &amp;
                enjoying everything. I am traveling mostly by water,&#8212;and spent several days in
                "the Lakes of the Thousand Islands"&#8212;that is what they call a part of the St
                Lawrence river, some 50 miles long, &amp; 10 to 20 wide, filled with the prettiest
                islands you ever see, all sizes, some quite big with fine farms on them, &amp; some
                very moderate&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00261_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/>others rocky hills like, of an acre or two covered with
                cedars&#8212;but <hi rend="underline">the water</hi> every where I travel in this
                country is the best part,&#8212;it is more beautiful and bright than you can conceive,
                very clean &amp; pure, of a sky-blue color &amp; there seems no end of it&#8212;I
                travel for days &amp; days over it, from Lake Huron on through Lake Erie and Ontario
                &amp; down the St Lawrence to here (700 miles) &amp; it is just as fascinating to me
                now as ever&#8212;I have been in sight of it or traveling on it ever since I have been in
                Canada&#8212;I never get tired of it&#8212;(We have nothing like it our way, so
                grand &amp; bright &amp; clear.)</p>
            <p>&#8212;This is a large &amp; busy city, the most
                important in Canada, ships and steamboats &amp; immense numbers of
                emigrants&#8212;<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00260_large.jpg" type="recto"/>This is in general 
                quite a great farming country&#8212;the land not near so rich &amp; good as out west in the United States,&#8212;
                <choice><orig>dont</orig><reg>don't</reg></choice> raise such corn &amp;c&#8212;but it is a healthy &amp; 
                beautiful country here, good climate&#8212;pretty good for wheat&#8212;they raise a good deal of barley here, 
                (perhaps more than any other grain)&#8212;but a fair show of wheat&#8212;first rate for grass&#8212;ditto for 
                apples&#8212;then there is so good a chance for a farmer to have his farm run down to the water&#8212;As I travel I see
                hundreds and hundreds of farms, seems to me a majority of them along the banks,&#8212;they set a little up, &amp;
                sprinkled with trees&#8212;looks as though the folks ought to be happy&#8212;(but I suppose they are just like all
                the rest of us)&#8212;It is very different from what I saw out in Kansas last fall&#8212;no water <hi rend="underline">there</hi></p>
           
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc_vm.00262_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>I often think of you all, I wish your father could be out here, &amp; travel through
                it once see the country &amp; the water &amp; farming &amp; everything&#8212;he
                would enjoy seeing it all, &amp; would understand many things about it better than I
                do&#8212;But <hi rend="underline">you</hi> ought to take some such trip Mont boy,
                it would make you open your eyes&#8212;(Only I must say I like the smell of the <hi
                    rend="underline">salt and sedge</hi> along the water, it is what I was born to,
                like Long Island or Old Jersey&#8212;but it is all <hi rend="underline">fresh</hi>
                here)&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;I am going on some 400 miles further&#8212;north east to the river Saguenay, (you will see it on
                the map of Canada toward north east)&#8212;then back again to stay awhile in the old
