        <salute>Dear son,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I will begin a letter for you to-day, &amp; probably finish it to-morrow, &amp; send it
        off, so that you will have it by or before Sunday. The heat is again upon us here,
        days&#8212;but the nights are pleasant. It is now Thursday afternoon, between 3 and
        4&#8212;&amp; I am writing this in my room in Portland av. Pete, one month of my leave
        exactly is up to-day. I have been out quite a while to-day, over to New York, to the
        printing office, &amp; seeing to one thing &amp; another. It was sweaty work. On my way
        back, I went up in the pilot house &amp; sailed across the river three times&#8212;a fine
        breeze blowing. Then home&#8212;took a bath&#8212;ate my dinner&#8212;&amp; here I am all
        alone, most <choice><orig>stript</orig><reg>stripped</reg></choice>, taking things as cool as possible, &amp; writing this letter.</p>

      <p>Pete, your letter of 23d came yesterday, &amp; the one written partly that night &amp;
        partly 24th came this forenoon. Those are the only letters I have received since the one of
        13th telling me the orders were for you to go to work next day, (Sunday.) I have been uneasy
        ever since to hear. The letter rec'd this morning gives me the first definite information
        how things have turned out. Dear son, I want you to try to cast aside all irritating
        thoughts &amp; recollections, &amp; preserve a cheerful mind. That is the main part of
        getting along through the toil &amp; battle of life&#8212;&amp; it is a good deal habit.<ptr
          target="loc.01527_n1"/>
      </p>

      <p>I was away a good part of last week, down the bay&#8212;went away each time early in the
        morning, &amp; got home after dark. I am having quite jovial times. I went to Wallack's<ptr target="n0676"/>
        theatre one night lately with a friend who wanted to see a piece called "Fritz"<ptr
          target="loc.01527_n2"/>&#8212;a miserable, sickish piece. I was glad enough to get out in
        the open air away from such humbug. I am still feeling gay &amp; hearty. I work several
        hours a day keeping things straight among the printers &amp; founders, on my books. They are
        being cast in electrotype plates. I will tell you more about it when we meet. Well, Pete, I
        guess this will do for to-day. I think of sallying forth, soon as the sun gets pretty well
        down, &amp; crossing to New York to <choice><orig>loafe</orig><reg>loaf</reg></choice> around two or three hours. </p>

      <p rend="right">Friday afternoon <lb/>August 26. </p>

      <p>Well I went over to New York last evening&#8212;up town to see some friends&#8212;come home
        about 11&#8212;just in time to escape a thunder shower. It is splendid to-day&#8212;I have
        been over all day working, quite busy&#8212;&amp; have just got home &amp; had my
        dinner&#8212;it is now about 4&#8212;It is quite pleasant riding here in Brooklyn&#8212;we
        have large open cars&#8212;in good weather it is real lively&#8212;I quite enjoy
        it&#8212;</p>

      <p>Pete, give my respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, &amp; to your cousin&#8212;also to Jenny
          Murphy<ptr target="loc.01527_n3"/>&#8212;not forgetting the boys on the road&#8212;also
        Wash Milburn<ptr target="loc.01527_n4"/>&#8212;God bless you, &amp; good bye for this time,
        my own dear loving boy. </p>
