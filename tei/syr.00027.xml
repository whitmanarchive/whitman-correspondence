                    <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have your postal card of the 17th, and enclose the article from the <hi
                        rend="underline">Nation</hi>&#8212;an infamous article. I would give a great
                    deal to know <hi rend="underline">who</hi> is the writer. <hi rend="underline"
                        >Is it not possible to find this out</hi>?</p>
                <p>You mention it as in the N.Y. <hi rend="underline">Evening Post</hi>, of which
                    the <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi> is a weekly issue, though without
                    containing all its matter. So I am not sure that this libel was in both
                    papers.</p>
                <p>I also enclose a press <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="syr_kc.00110.jpg"
                        type="verso"/> copy of my reply, and of the note I subsequently addressed
                    with the <hi rend="underline">MS</hi> to the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi>.
                    Montgomery wrote me a very kind note, saying that the <hi rend="underline"
                        >Times</hi> editor wouldn't print my article for "professional
                    reasons"&#8212;which simply means, I suppose, that dog will not eat dog, or that
                    one member of the journalistic <hi rend="underline">condottieri</hi> will stand
                    by another in his iniquity.</p>
                <p>When I read the article over just now, it seemed a little better than I at first
                    thought it. I was quite ill and weighed down with <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                        facs="syr_kc.00111.jpg" type="recto"/> lassitude when I wrote
                    it,&#8212;spurred only by my indignation. Upon its return from the <hi
                        rend="underline">Times</hi>, I had a vague wandering notion of sending it to
                    the <hi rend="underline">Critic</hi>, as my blue pencil memorandum on the first
                    sheet indicates. But I suppose it is no use. I felt rather deterred by the
                    remembrance of Gilder's unfriendly spat at me when I was fighting that
                    contemptible clergyman, Chadwick, and was so clearly in the right. I had thought
                    of him previously as a friend of yours.</p>
                <p>I also enclose a slip from the <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi> which shows <pb
                        xml:id="leaf002v" facs="syr_kc.00112.jpg" type="verso"/> Dr. William
                    Hand Browne in the noble and honorable light of trying to edit out of poor
                    Lanier's silly lectures, the little praise he had bestowed on you&#8212;an
                    effort baffled only by the right instincts of the poet's widow. What a lot of
                    helldevils the literati are, to be sure!</p>
                <p>Send me back the slips sometime.</p>
                <p>I am glad you saw Marvin. He is the best of friends, and is firm in the
                    faith.</p>
                <p>I hope to get away for a few days soon. I am still in charge of the office,
                    and much burdened. More anon. I got your curious Shakespeare letter. Is he
                    crazy? Au revoir.</p>
