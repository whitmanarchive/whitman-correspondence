            </opener>
         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00588_n100"/> fear you took me last night for a female privateer. It's true that I was sailing under <hi rend="italic">false colors</hi>.&#8212;But the flag I assure you covered nothing piratical&#8212;although I would joyfully have made your heart a captive.</p>
            <p>Women have an unequal chance in this world. Men are its monarchs, and "full many a rose is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness in the desert air."<ptr target="loc.00588_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Such I was resolved should not be the fate of this fancy I had long nourished for you.&#8212;A gold mine may be found by the Divining Rod but there is no such instrument for detecting in the crowded streets of a great city the [unknown?] mine of latent affection a man may have unconsciously inspired in a woman's heart. I make these explanations in extenuation not by way of apology. My social position enjoins precaution &amp; mystery, and perhaps the enjoyment of my friend's society is heightened which in yielding to its fascination I preserve my incognito; yet mystery lends an ineffable charm to love and when a woman is bent upon the gratification of her inclinations&#8212;She is pardonable if she still spreads the veil of decorum over her actions. Hypocrisy is said to be "the homage which sin pays to virtue," and yet <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can see no vice in that generous sympathy with which we share our caprices with those who have inspired us with tenderness,&#8212;</p>
            <p>I trust you will think well enough of me soon to renew the pleasure you afforded me last P.M., and I therefore write to remind you that there is a sensible head as well as a sympathetic heart, both of which would gladly evolve wit &amp; warmth for your direction &amp; comfort.&#8212;You have already my whereabouts &amp; my hours&#8212;It shall only depend upon you to make them yours and me the happiest of women.</p>
            <closer rend="right">

                  <salute>I am always</salute>
