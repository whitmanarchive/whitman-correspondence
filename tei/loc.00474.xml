            <p>Although you hear from us so seldom yet we do not forget you&#8212;I expected to get to Camden before this<ptr target="loc.00474_n1"/>&#8212;but business prevented&#8212;We have had lots of political trouble here this spring and summer and the end is not yet&#8212;how it will affect me I am unable to even guess now&#8212;sometimes it looks bad and then again as if it would blow over&#8212;at any rate it cannot be long before it will decide itself one way or another<ptr target="loc.00474_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tis a long while since we have heard from you&#8212;how are you getting along  now and then we see some little thing in the papers&#8212;the last was that you were engaged in getting up another book<ptr target="loc.00474_n3"/>&#8212;I was glad to know that you were feeling well enough&#8212;</p>
            <p>How is George and Loo. I hope well  Is George busy still on the pipe question  We are having very hot weather for the last few days&#8212;On Thursday next Hattie and Jessie depart for Iowa or Wisconsin for a month or two&#8212;Jess and Hat have grown quite up and begin to look like young ladies&#8212;they keep to school pretty close and study well&#8212;</p>
            <p>Let me hear form you when you can&#8212;if matters change here I shall make you a visit for awhile&#8212;I should endeavor to get a job in Baltimore as I see they are getting ready to build works there&#8212;</p>
            <p>Love to all&#8212;not forgetting Ed</p>
