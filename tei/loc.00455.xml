               <p>I heard her tell Hattie this morning that she would certainly write you a letter to-day&#8212;</p>

               <p>Matters go middling well with me&#8212;have been very busy&#8212;had no time to do anything&#8212;could'nt even go a fishing</p>
               <p>Love to all&#8212;tell Walt that I wish he would come and see us&#8212;shall leave it to Mat to persuade you and Loo and George out here&#8212;Hat and Jess are as well as can be  I sometimes think they are "weller"</p>
