            <p>At the request of your mother &#38; from what you wrote some time ago I bundled up
                all the old letters I could find, &#38; Edward Stafford<ptr target="nyp.00534_n2"/>
                stopt here &#38; took them to her&#8212;this is over a week ago, (Ed still comes up
                here to school in Phila. to learn bookkeeping)&#8212;I believe your folks are all as
                usual&#8212;but I suppose you have heard from there, latest particulars. I am
                jogging along pretty much the same as ever&#8212;was to the theatre last week, &#38;
                enjoyed it, "Francesca da Rimini"&#8212;lots of love-making &#38; hugging in the
                play, done first rate&#8212;I quite fell in love with the lady actress (Mary
                    Wainwright)<ptr target="nyp.00534_n3"/>&#8212;the actors spied me in front,
                &#38; sent around to ask me to come behind the scenes, which I did at the end of the
                play, &#38; was made much of, especially by Barrett the star&#8212;was invited to go
                with him to the Continental to supper&#8212;which I declined<ptr
                    target="nyp.00534_n4"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p> I am doing a little in writing&#8212;have a little poem in Harpers for March,
                forthcoming, which I will send you<ptr target="nyp.00534_n5"/>&#8212;(I sent you the
                Indian piece,<ptr target="nyp.00534_n6"/> I believe)&#8212;When you get ready to go
                on further, or to any Western city, or anywhere, I will furnish you with a general
                letter of recommendation, if you wish it&#8212;may serve to break the ice, possibly,
                somewhere. I suppose you get the Camden &#38; other papers I send&#8212;</p>
            <p> For over a month now we have had rough winter weather here&#8212;lately rain &#38;
                fog, most a week&#8212;but to-day is bright &#38; fine&#8212;I am sitting up in the
                3d story room, Stevens street, in the afternoon sun writing this&#8212;Glad you
                write to me in such good spirits, &#38; are well&#8212;<hi rend="italic">they two
                    are every thing</hi>&#8212;Keep on&#8212;explore the big western cities,
                Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis&#8212;Denver&#8212;even to California&#8212;it will do
                you good to see the actual world, &#38; men &#38; affairs&#8212;God bless you, dear
