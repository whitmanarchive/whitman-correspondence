            <p>Although I have written two or three letters to you, and Hattie one or two&#8212;yet we do not hear from you  dear brother, are you too sick to write  I had a letter from Mother yesterday in which she told me that you had been out a few times and once as far as the office&#8212;I hope you have not had a set back since then</p>
            <p>If you can I wish you would write me how you are and if you have any chance of getting out here this season&#8212;I wish you could come  I think you would enjoy it and I know we would enjoy it hugely</p>
            <p>I fear from the way that Mother writes that she is not feeling very well&#8212;that she is not quite as happy as when she kept her own house&#8212;what do you think about it<ptr target="loc.00471_n1"/>
            </p>
            <p>I shall always feel sorry that Mother could not have come out here before Mattie died&#8212;she did want to see her so badly&#8212;for a week or two before she died she talked much about both of you and Mother and longed much to see you both&#8212;but it was not [to] be that she could see either of you</p>
            <p>I have felt quite anxious about you&#8212;as tis so long since I heard from you directly&#8212;I [hope] dear Walt you feel like writing, at least a short letter to me</p>
            <p>Hattie and Jess keep quite well and are as good as can be</p>
            <p>Write to me Walt</p>
