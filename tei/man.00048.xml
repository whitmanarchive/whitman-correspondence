            <p>I found your letter and Mrs Gilchrists<ptr target="n0259"/> and Mr Carpenters<ptr target="n0141b"/> on my return, and we were
                much alarmed at first by reports, that you were very sick, but <choice>

                hope by this time you are on the mend, and will be able to make your trip. I have
                had such a delightful time, no

                the world over one could not find anything to compare with the Falls. Watkins Glen<ptr target="n3032"/>
                is wonderful too, we were fortunate in Hotels, and <choice><orig>every thing</orig><reg>everything</reg></choice>, I brought home some views of the Glen and Falls. Aunt Libbie<ptr target="duk.00615_n7"/> is here
                still. Geo is well, in fact I never saw him look better, busy as ever, no time to
                ride much. Mrs Berry and family, have gone to

                Wilson's infant is getting well. When I came home and found that the report was that
                you were very sick, I said that if I had known that, I would have gone to Canada,
                but the next day it was put in a milder way. I saw Mr Scovel<ptr target="n1049"/> in a street car the

                return, it will be as well, and you have passed over so much of the same country.</p>
