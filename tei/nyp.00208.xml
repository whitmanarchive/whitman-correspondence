            <p>I rec'd your letter of last Thursday&#8212;I suppose you got one from me the Saturday before, with some envelopes in, &amp; $1&#8212;Well, mother, you have got a letter from that good for nothing pup again<ptr target="nyp.00208_n1"/>&#8212;it is too bad to be worried so&#8212;but one is powerless to do any thing, under present circumstances&#8212;I hope George will do well, in the houses, if he &amp; the others put them up on Portland av.&#8212;I see there are cases of cholera once in a while in New York&#8212;you must all be careful of yourselves&#8212;it is very healthy here this summer&#8212;I havn't been troubled by the heat yet&#8212;my head is much better&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I must tell you I am having some new shirts made&#8212;quite an event&#8212;I can't hardly believe it when I think how those old ones you fixed, &amp; fixed again, have held out&#8212;but, poor old things, they have got played out pretty well&#8212;why I believe I have got one or two that you fixed for me when I went to Boston there six years ago, &amp; more&#8212;I have 'em made in the same way as ever, &amp; I think they are going to be very good&#8212;I expect to have half a dozen&#8212;so you see I am coming out&#8212;had quite a clearing out the other day, collected all my old tattered duds &amp; socks, &amp; boots &amp; slippers &amp;c &amp;c. into a great heap&#8212;and when Sally, our black girl, brought up my breakfast, I told her she could have 'em all, if she wanted 'em&#8212;she was most tickled to death&#8212;took 'em all off home&#8212;there was nothing but what was all give out, though&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is nothing new with me in my affairs&#8212;if things would only work so that I could get a higher grade, with more pay, it would come very acceptable&#8212;but here I remain, in the same way as at first&#8212;however I am very glad to have what I have&#8212;Tell Jeff<ptr target="nyp.00208_n2"/> I should like to see him very much&#8212;I think he would find it pleasant to come here for a few days, even this season&#8212;Well, dear mother, my sheet is full&#8212;love to all&#8212;</p>
