        <salute>Dear friend,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I still remain here in Camden, &amp; in a condition not much different&#8212;alternating constantly between the bad spells, &amp; then hours, &amp; sometimes days, 
        not so bad. I suppose you rec'd the little Philadelphia paper I sent a week since&#8212;Dr. Grier here is confident my principal trouble is cerebral anæmia (blood not 
        properly going to the brain to nourish it)&#8212;says it arises from a long 
        continued excessive emotional action generally<ptr target="nyp.00311_n2"/>&#8212;&amp; thinks it so has arisen in my case&#8212;does not think writing, or study, or ordinary brain action has been the cause&#8212;it has been long a-coming &amp; will probably be long a-going&#8212;thinks I will get well however.
      </p>
      
      <p>He thinks it has been coming on for many years, says I need rest, rest for a long time 
        &amp; social exhilaration&#8212;(The paralysis, according to him, is only an incident, or result, 
        &amp; not the cause-disease)&#8212;Since I have been here I have followed Dr. Drinkard's advice&#8212;taken no medicine, &amp; lived very prudently&#8212;(I still quite thoroughly believe in Dr. Drinkard)&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Charles Eldridge called upon me on his way back&#8212;his visit was a great treat, 
        &amp; was only too short&#8212;I rec'd a letter from him a few days since&#8212;all goes on as usual in Washington matters we are interested in&#8212;I have a substitute<ptr target="nyp.00311_n3"/> working for me at my desk, and he seems to give satisfaction&#8212;When I shall be able to go to work again, if ever, is as indefinite now as it has been for over seven months&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I have <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> a letter from John Burroughs. He has bought some land at Esopus, 
        on the Hudson, west bank, some 80 miles from New York, &amp; is going 
        to build him a house &amp; home there forthwith.
      </p>
      
      <p>I get out some&#8212;went over to Philadelphia yesterday&#8212;go sometimes 
        to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, as it is very pleasant there 
        for a change&#8212;or rather for a place to go to &amp; rest&#8212;though the atmosphere 
        of a <hi rend="italic">reading room</hi> soon weighs on me, &amp; I feel like retreating&#8212;Yesterday 
        took a ride up in the Market <choice><abbr>st.</abbr><expan>Street</expan></choice> cars to West Philadelphia&#8212;&amp; was caught in a violent shower coming home in the evening, &amp; nicely soaked&#8212;Soon as I got home it <choice><orig status="unremarkable">stopt</orig><reg>stopped</reg></choice>, and we had a splendid moonlight evening&#8212;It is bright &amp; clear to-day, &amp; rather hot&#8212;It is socially here an utter blank to me&#8212;my cynical dread of being bored by any one is now completely gratified with a vengeance&#8212;I look long &amp; long at my mother's miniature, &amp; at my sister Mat's&#8212;I have very good one's of each&#8212;&amp; O the wish if I could only be with them&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>Nelly, this has grown to be a perturbed sort of letter&#8212;&amp; had better be torn up&#8212;but I will let it go.
