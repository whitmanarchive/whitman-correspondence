            <p>Let me greet you. Happy New
                Year to you. Your poems have
                come to me anew&#8212;here in
                Rome&#8212;and have revived
                and deepened my consciousness
                of great things, of beautiful
                things, of everything that lives.
                In writing to you at this 
                late time (for I knew your
                poems many years back)
                I do what I have often 
                wished to do.&#8212;Thank you.

            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_jp.00174.jpg" type="recto"/>

                Christmas Day brought me a
                present of all your writings&#8212;original 
                editions&#8212;and hence
                this movement of admiration
                and love towards you.</p>
            <p>It is fine to have your words, 
                your brave sweet words, here
                where old Rome crumbles and
                new Rome grows; it is fine
                to have your visions of the 
                States, of men and women
                in our land, while I am
                close to the Coliseum,
                not far from the Pantheon
                and the Appian Way.
                I shall write. Your 
                poems are an Appian
                Way for the triumphal

                thoughts of the American, and you celebrate
                a theatre of action greater than Rome's
                Coliseum in celebrating our wide land.
                I shall hope for the chance to say <choice><orig>publically</orig><reg>publicly</reg></choice>
                what I now write to you. I have been
                several years in Rome. I have my studies
                here&#8212;for I am a painter. I trust that
                the time may come when, before this year
                has gone&#8212;I may have the pleasure
                of seeing you.
