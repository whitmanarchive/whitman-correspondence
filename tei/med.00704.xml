            <p>I return you today the proof in <hi rend="underline">pages</hi><ptr target="n0119"/><!--<ptr target="rlc.00018_n5"/>--> I have considered it all very carefully and am quite satisfied as to the  
                    rearrangement<ptr target="med.00704_n1"/> of pages, pictures &#38;c. please <gap
                    reason="cut away"/> leave them as I have put them&#8212;I
                have not made much change&#8212;the burial scenes <hi rend="underline">must</hi>
                face different pages as they will only be known as described in "List of
                Illustrations" by that fact&#8212;It would not do to print on back of photo-intaglio
                so I have added a leaf&#8212;the photo-intaglio will face title
                <gap reason="cut away"/> page&#8212;the birth-house will
                    face opening of chap I (p. 13)&#8212;the "remote" and "immediate"
                "ancestry" pages I have moved as you will see&#8212;Van Velsor burial <gap
                    reason="cut away"/> hill picture will face p. 15, and W. burial hill picture
                p. 17&#8212;Portrait of father will face p. 26 (mention of his death)&#8212;every
                thing else is left as you put it. <gap reason="cut away"/> I want portrait of Mother
                to face mention of her death (towards end of chap I)&#8212;then the photograph or
                phototype of W. W. in 1880 might face the opening of chap
                ii (W. W. in 1880)&#8212;and fac-simile of writing should face page in that chap.
                where handwriting is mentioned.<ptr target="med.00704_n2"/> You told me McKay<!--<ptr
                    target="syr.00031_n3"/>--> could get the pictures printed in Phila at $1.80 or $2
                    p.m.<ptr target="med.00704_n3"/> have a letter from McK. in which he says
                Sherman &#38; Co would charge me $20 p.m. for <hi rend="underline">three</hi>,
                however, no matter, they are ordered at De Vinnes N.Y. and will be done immediately.
                I like all your emendations, additions, &#38;c so far (on the whole) very much, I
                can see that you are materially improving the book, for <choice><abbr>wh</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I feel very <choice>
