         <p>We<ptr target="loc.00560_n100"/> want to be the publishers of Walt. Whitman's Poems&#8212;Leaves of Grass.&#8212;When the book was first issued we were clerks in the establishment we now own.<ptr target="loc.00560_n2"/>
 We read the book with profit and pleasure. It is a true poem and writ by a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> man.</p>
            <p>When a man dares to speak his thought in this day of refinement&#8212;so called&#8212;it is difficult to find his mates to act amen to it. Now <hi rend="italic">we</hi> want to be known as the publishers of Walt. Whitman's books, and put our name as such under his, on title pages.&#8212;If you will allow it we can and will put your books into good form, and style attract<hi rend="italic">ive</hi> to the eye; we can and will sell a large number of copies; we have great facilities by and through numberless Agents in selling. We can dispose of more books than most publishing houses (we do not "puff" here but speak <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>).</p>
            <p>We are young men. We "celebrate" ourselves by acts. Try us. You can do us good. We can do you good&#8212;pecuniarily.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, if you wish to make acquaintance with us, and accept us as your <pb facs="loc.00560.002.jpg" xml:id="leaf001v" type="verso"/>publishers, we will offer to either buy the stereotype plates of Leaves of Grass, or pay you for the use of them, in addition to regular copyright.</p>
            <p>Are you writing other poems? Are they ready for the press? Will you let us read them? Will you write us? Please give us your residence</p>
