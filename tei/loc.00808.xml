            <p>I am writing this by the side of the young man you asked about, Lewis Brown,<ptr target="loc.00808_n1"/> in Armory Square hospital&#8212;He is now getting along very well indeed&#8212;The amputation is healing up good, &amp; he does not suffer any thing like as much as he did. I see him every day. We have had real hot weather here, &amp; for the last three days wet &amp; rainy&#8212;it is more like June than February&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I wrote to Han, last Saturday&#8212;she must have got it yesterday&#8212;I have not heard any thing from home since a week ago, (your last letter)&#8212;I suppose you got a letter from me Saturday last&#8212;I am well as usual&#8212;there has been several hundred sick soldiers brought in here yesterday&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have been around among them to-day all day&#8212;it is enough to make one heart-sick, the old times over again&#8212;they are many of them mere wrecks, though young men&#8212;(sickness is worse in some respects than wounds)&#8212;one boy<ptr target="loc.00808_n2"/> about 16, from Portland, Maine, only came from home a month ago, a recruit, he is here now, very sick &amp; downhearted, poor child, he is a real country boy, I think has consumption&#8212;he was only a week with his reg't&#8212;I sat with him a long time&#8212;I saw [it] did him great good&#8212;I have been feeding some their dinners&#8212;it makes me feel quite proud, I find so frequently I can do with the men what no one else at all can, getting them to eat, (some that will not touch their food otherwise, nor for any body else)&#8212;it is sometimes quite affecting I can tell you&#8212;I found such a case to-day, a soldier with throat disease, very bad&#8212;I fed him quite a dinner&#8212;the men, his comrades around, just stared in wonder, &amp; one of them told me afterwards that he (the sick man) had not eat so much at a meal, in three months&#8212;Mother, I shall have my hands pretty full now for a while&#8212;write all about things home&#8212;</p>
