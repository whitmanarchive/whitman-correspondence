               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I wrote to Jeff Sunday last that his letters sent Sept 3d containing your letter &amp; $5 from Mr Lane had miscarried&#8212;this morning when I came down to Major Hapgood's office I found it on my table, so it is all right&#8212;singular where it has been all this while as I see the post mark on it is Brooklyn Sept 3 as Jeff said<ptr target="loc.00788_n1"/>&#8212;Mother, what to do about Andrew I hardly know&#8212;as it is I feel about as much pity for you as I do for my poor brother Andrew, for I know you will worry yourself about him all the time&#8212;I was in hopes it was only the trouble about the voice &amp;c but I see I was mistaken, &amp; it is probably worse&#8212;I know you &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat will do all you can&#8212;&amp; will have patience with all (it is not only the sick who are poorly off, but their friends&#8212;but it is best to have the greatest forbearance, &amp; do &amp; give &amp;c whatever one can&#8212;but you know that, &amp; practice it too, dear mother)<ptr target="loc.00788_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, if I had the means, O how cheerfully I would give them, whether they availed any thing for Andrew or not&#8212;yet I have long made up my mind that money does not amount to so much, at least not so very much, in serious cases of sickness&#8212;it is judgment, both in the person himself, &amp; in those he has to do with&#8212;&amp; good heart is every thing&#8212;(Mother, you remember Theodore Gould,<ptr target="loc.00788_n3"/> how he has stuck it out, though sickness &amp; death has had hold of him as you may say for fifteen years)&#8212;but any how I hope we will all do what we can for Andrew&#8212;Mother, I think I must try to come home for a month&#8212;I have not given up my project of lecturing, I spoke about before,<ptr target="loc.00788_n4"/> but shall put it in practice yet, I feel clear it will succeed enough. (I wish I had some of the money already, it would be satisfaction to me to contribute something to Andrew's necessities, for he must have bread)&#8212;I will write to you of course before I come&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I hope you will live better&#8212;Jeff tells me you &amp; Jess &amp; Ed live on poor stuff, you are so economical<ptr target="loc.00788_n5"/>&#8212;Mother, you mustn't do so, as long as you have a cent&#8212;I hope you will at least four or five times a week have a steak of beef or mutton, or something substantial for dinner&#8212;I have one good meal of that kind every day, or at least five or six days out of the seven&#8212;but for breakfast I never have any thing but a cup of tea &amp; some bread or crackers, (first rate tea though with milk &amp; good white sugar)&#8212;well I find it is hearty enough&#8212;more than half the time I never eat any thing after dinner, &amp; when I do it is only a cracker &amp; cup of tea&#8212;Mother, I hope you will not stint yourselves&#8212;as to using George's money for your &amp; Jess's &amp; Ed's needful living expenses, I know George would be mad &amp; hurt in his feelings, if he thought you was afraid to&#8212;Mother, now have a comfortable time as much as you can, &amp; get a steak occasionally, won't you?</p>
            <p>I suppose Mat got her letter last Saturday, I sent it Friday&#8212;O I was so pleased that Jeff was not drawn,<ptr target="loc.00788_n6"/> &amp; I know how Mat must have felt too, &amp; you too&#8212;I have no idea the government will try to draft again, whatever happens&#8212;they have carried their point, but have not made much out of it&#8212;O how the conscripts &amp; substitutes are deserting down in front, &amp; on their way there&#8212;you don't hear any thing about it, but it is incredible&#8212;they don't allow it to get in the papers&#8212;Mother, I was so glad to get your letter, you must write again&#8212;can't you write to-morrow, so I can get it Friday or Saturday?&#8212;you know though you wrote more than a week ago I did not get it till this morning&#8212;I wish Jeff to write too, as often as he can&#8212;mother, I was gratified to hear you went up among the soldiers<ptr target="loc.00788_n7"/>&#8212;they are rude in appearance, but they know what is decent, and it pleases them much to have folks, even old women, take an interest &amp; come among them&#8212;mother, you must go again, &amp; take [Hat]&#8212;Well, dear mother, I must close&#8212;I am first rate in health, so much better than a month &amp; two mo's ago&#8212;my hand has entirely healed&#8212;I go to hospital every day, or night&#8212;I believe no men ever loved each other as I &amp; some of these poor wounded, sick &amp; dying men love each other&#8212;good bye, dearest mother, for present&#8212;</p>
