            <p>I have had the misfortune to fall back a little since I wrote to you&#8212;I have had three or four pretty bad days &amp; nights&#8212;but I am feeling decidedly brighter this afternoon, &amp; have no doubt I shall be myself again before long. The trouble has been as before, bad spells of weakness with heavy aching head&#8212;I think the throat is no worse, but it is not well yet&#8212;</p>
            <p>William, I rec'd your letter to-day, also one from Charles Eldridge, with one in envelope&#8212;as to the future, &amp; as to our meeting again, I have no doubt we shall meet again &amp; have good times<ptr target="nyp.00189_n2"/>&#8212;if Nelly has not gone when this reaches you, I wish her to consider it just the same as if written to her&#8212;I do not write much, nor do any thing hardly, but keep as quiet as possible&#8212;my physician thinks that time, with the change of locality, &amp; my own latent recuperative power, will make me well, but says my system is probably saturated with the virus of the hospitals &amp;c which eludes ordinary treatment&#8212;&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have nothing new or interesting to write you. I intend to move heaven &amp; earth to publish my "Drum-Taps" as soon as I am able to go around.</p>
            <p>So Eldridge is down at Petersburgh<ptr target="nyp.00189_n3"/>&#8212;if I were there at Washington &amp; well I should want no better fun than accompanying them&#8212;When you see Count<ptr target="nyp.00189_n4"/> tell him I sent him my love&#8212;also Ashton&#8212;I will write should there be any change in my condition&#8212;</p>
            <p>Good bye for present, my dear friend, &amp; God bless you<ptr target="nyp.00189_n5"/>&#8212;</p>
