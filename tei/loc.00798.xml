               <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>[Nothing] particular new with me. I am well &amp; hearty&#8212;think a good deal about home. Mother, I so much want to see you, even if only for a couple of weeks&#8212;for I feel I must return here &amp; continue my hospital operations. They are so much needed, although one can do only such a little in comparison, amid these thousands. Then I desire much to see Andrew.<ptr target="loc.00798_n1"/> I wonder if I could cheer him up any&#8212;does he get any good from that treatment with the baths, &amp;c. Mother, I suppose you have your hands full with Nancy's poor little children, &amp; one worry &amp; another (when one gets old little things bother a great deal). Mother, I go down every day looking for a letter from you or Jeff&#8212;I had two from Jeff latter part of the week.<ptr target="loc.00798_n2"/> I want to see Jeff much. I wonder why he didn't send me the Union with my letter in.<ptr target="loc.00798_n3"/> I am disappointed at not getting it. I sent Han [a] N Y Times with my last letter, &amp; one to George too. Have you heard any thing from George or Han?</p> 
            <p>There is a new lot of wounded now again.<ptr target="loc.00798_n4"/> They have been arriving, sick &amp; wounded, for three days&#8212;First long strings of ambulances with the sick. But yesterday many with bad &amp; bloody wounds, poor fellows. I thought I was cooler &amp; more used to it, but the sight of some of them brought tears into my eyes&#8212;Mother, I had the good luck yesterday to do quite a great deal of good&#8212;I had provided a lot of nourishing things for the men, but for another quarter&#8212;but I had them where I could use them immediately for these new wounded as they came in faint &amp; hungry, &amp; fagged out with a long rough journey, all dirty &amp; torn, &amp; many pale as ashes, &amp; all bloody&#8212;I distributed all my stores, gave partly to the nurses I knew that were just taking charge of them&#8212;&amp; as many as I could I fed myself&#8212;Then besides I found a lot of oyster soup handy, &amp; I procured it all at once&#8212;Mother, it is the most pitiful sight I think when first the men are brought in&#8212;I have to bustle round, to keep from crying&#8212;they are such rugged young men&#8212;all these just arrived are cavalry men&#8212;Our troops got the worst of it, but fought like devils. Our men engaged were Kilpatrick's<ptr target="loc.00798_n5"/> cavalry. They were in the rear as part of Meade's retreat&#8212;&amp; the reb cavalry cut in between &amp; cut them off &amp; [attacked] them &amp; shelled them terribly. But Kilpatrick brought them out mostly&#8212;this was last Sunday.</p>
            <p>Mother, I will try to come home before long, if only for six or eight days. I wish to see you, &amp; Andrew&#8212;I wish to see the young ones &amp; Mat. You must write. I am about moving,<ptr target="loc.00798_n6"/> I have been hunting for a room to-day&#8212;I shall write next how I succeed. Good by for present, dear mother.</p>
