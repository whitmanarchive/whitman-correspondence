                <salute>MY DEAREST FRIEND:</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I have just been sauntering in our little but sunny garden which slopes to the
                South<!--<ptr target="n0259"/>-->&#8212;surveying with much satisfaction some fruit trees&#8212;plum, green
                gage, pear, cherry, apple&#8212;which we have just had planted to train up against
                the house and fence&#8212;in which fashion fruit ripens much better with our English
                modicum of sunshine, besides taking no room &#38; casting no shade over your little
                bit of ground&#8212;Then we have filed our large window with flowers in pots which
                make the room smell as delicious as a garden. Giddy<!--<ptr target="n0890"/>--> is assiduous in keeping them
                well watered &#38; tended.&#8212;Welcome was your postcard&#8212;with the little
                rain-bird's coy note in it. But I had not before heard of your illness, dear
                friend&#8212;the letter before, you spoke of being unusually well, as I trust you
                are again now, &#38; enjoying the spring. I am well again so far as digestion
                &#38;c. goes; but bronchitis asthma of a chronic kind still trouble me. My
                breath is so short I cannot walk, which is a privation. I am going, at the beginning
                of June, to stay with Bee<!--<ptr target="n0260"/>--> in Edinburgh, as she will not have any holiday or be able
                to come &#38; see us this year, &#38; much am I longing to be with her. Have you
                begun to have any summer thoughts, dear Walt? And do they turn towards England,
                &#38; our nest therein? Yes, I have received &#38; have enjoyed all the papers
                &#38; cuttings&#8212;dearly like what you said of Carlyle. Everyone here is speaking
                bitterly of the harsh judgments &#38; sarcastic descriptions of people in the
                "reminiscences." But I know that at bottom his heart was genial and good &#38; that
                he wrote those in a miserable mood&#8212;&#38; never looked at them again
                afterwards. I hope you received the little memoir of my husband all right.
                Herby<!--<ptr target="n0262"/>--> is very busy with a drawing of you&#8212;hopes that with the many sketches he
                made, &#38; the vivid impress on his memory &#38; the help of photographs, it will
                be good. I wish he had possessed as much power with the brush when he was in America
                as he has now&#8212;he is making very great progress in mastery of the technique. I
                observe, too, that he reads &#38; dwells upon your poems&#8212;especially the "Walt
                Whitman"&#8212;with growing frequency &#38; delight. We often say, "Won't Walt like
                sitting in that sunny window?" or "by that cheery open fire" or
                "sauntering on the heath"&#8212;&#38; picture you here in a thousand different ways.
                I believe Maggie Lesley is coming from Paris, where she is studying art in good
                earnest, at the beginning of May, &#38; then will come and spend a few days
                with us. Welcome are American friends! The Buxton Forman's<!--<ptr target="n0240"/>--> took tea with us last
                week &#38; we had pleasant talk of you &#38; of Dr. Bucke.<!--<ptr target="n0119"/>--> Mrs. Forman is a sincere,
                sympathetic, motherly woman whom you would like. The Rossetti's too have been to see
                us&#8212;we didn't think William<!--<ptr target="n0522"/>--> in the best health or spirits&#8212;&#38; his wife
                was not looking well either, but then another baby is just coming.</p>

            <p>This Easter time the poorest of London working folk flock in enormous numbers to
                Hampstead Heath; it is a sight that would interest you&#8212;they are rougher
                &#38; noisier &#38; poorer than such folks in America&#8212;&#38; the men more prone
                to get the worse for drink&#8212;but there is a good deal of fun &#38;
                merriment too&#8212;the girls &#38; boys racing about on donkeys (who have a
                pretty hard time of it)&#8212;plenty of merry-go-rounds&#8212;&#38;
                enjoyment of the pure air &#38; sunshine, &#38; such sights, more than they know.
                The light is failing, dearest friend; so with love from us all,
                good-bye.</p>
