            </opener>
            <p>I feel quite bad to hear that you are not well, have a pain in your side, &amp; a very bad cold&#8212;dear Mother, I hope it is better&#8212;I wish you would write to me, or Jeff would, right away, as I shall not feel easy until I hear&#8212;I rec'd George's letter, Jeff wrote with it, about your feeling pretty sick, &amp; the pain&#8212;Mother, I also rec'd your letter a few days before&#8212;you say the Brown's acted very mean &amp; I should think they did indeed, but as it is going to remain the same about the house, I should let it all pass<ptr target="loc.00813_n1"/>&#8212;I am very glad Mat &amp; Jeff are going to remain, I should not have felt satisfied if they &amp; you had been separated&#8212;I have written a letter to Han, with others enclosed, a good long letter, (took two postage stamps)&#8212;I have written to George too, directed it to Knoxville.<ptr target="loc.00813_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mother, every thing is the same with me, I am feeling very well indeed, the old trouble of my head stopt &amp; my ears affected, has not troubled me any since I came back here from Brooklyn&#8212;I am writing this in Major Hapgood's old office, cor 15th &amp; F st., where I have my old table &amp; window&#8212;it is dusty &amp; chilly to-day, any thing but agreeable&#8212;Gen Grant is expected every moment now in the Army of the Potomac, to take active command&#8212;I have just this moment heard from the front&#8212;there is nothing yet of a movement, but each side is continually on the alert, expecting something to happen&#8212;O mother, to think that we are to have here soon what I have seen so many times, the awful loads &amp; trains &amp; boat loads of poor bloody &amp; pale &amp; wounded young men again&#8212;for that is what we certainly will, &amp; before very long&#8212;I see all the little signs, getting ready in the hospitals &amp;c.&#8212;it is dreadful, when one thinks about it&#8212;I sometimes think over the sights I have myself seen, the arrival of the wounded after a battle, &amp; the scenes on the field too, &amp; I can hardly believe my own recollection&#8212;what an awful thing war is&#8212;Mother, it seems not men but a lot of devils &amp; butchers butchering each other&#8212;</p>
            <p>Dear Mother, I think twenty times a day about your sickness&#8212;O I hope it is not so bad as Jeff wrote, he said you was worse than you had ever been before&#8212;&amp; he would write me again&#8212;well he must, even if only a few lines&#8212;what have you heard from Mary &amp; her family, anything?</p>
            <p>Well, dear Mother, I hope this will find you quite well of the pain, &amp; of your cold&#8212;write about the little girls &amp; Mat &amp; all&#8212;</p>
