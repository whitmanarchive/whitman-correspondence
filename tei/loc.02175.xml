                <salute>My dear old Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have been a good deal worried of late. My Publisher&#8212;T. Fisher Unwin prepared a
                contract which does not satisfy lawyers and business men&#8212;nor me either when
                they explained it.<ptr target="loc.02178_n1"/> Hence delays, insolent
                letters&#8212;in short, matters came to such a pass that I have placed the <hi rend="underline">un</hi>signed
                draft entirely in the hands of Mr. Ross,&#8212;Honorary Secretary of the Incorporated
                Society of Authors.<ptr target="loc.02175_n1"/> A first rate fellow, who
                understands <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02175.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                Publishers &#38; their agreements, perhaps as well as any man in England.</p>
            <p>The upshot of it all will be that either Unwin will sign my agreement as drawn by
                Ross <hi rend="underline">or</hi> I shall part company with my gentleman.</p>
            <p>The bone of contention is over the change of form: the publisher wishes to reserve to
                himself the exclusive right of altering the form &#38; price of editions with out
                taking heed of author's wishes. Though Unwin owns that it is a good book, and that the author is getting
                very little for it; yet he has the cheek to stand out for this cool
                proposition&#8212;and my advisers (amongst them is one of the ablest lawyers in
                London) says that <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02175.004_large.jpg" type="recto"
                /> this won't do. </p>
            <p>I am vexed that the final circular is not to hand. I corrected the final revise (the
                list of names etc:) months ago and posted back to Fraser&#8212;the printer. </p>
            <p>John Fraser<ptr target="loc.02186_n2"/> (a friend of yours) as I think as I mentioned to you in a previous
                letter, is doing this for love and not money; therefore I have not been able to
                hurry him. However I wrote about it a few days ago, asking for some explanation as
                to such delay. As you know he would not hear of taking any money from me for the
                first circular relating to free-will-offering&#8212; <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.02175.003_large.jpg" type="verso"/> though a journey man printer, I
                take it or foreman? I don't clearly know his exact position Cope's Tobacco Factory
                at Liverpool.</p>  
               <p>Your last letter to William M. Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> is to be facsimiled as before. </p>
            <p>Grace<ptr target="n0890"/> is staying at Marley with a friend in Surrey. I expect her back on Monday. </p>
            <p>I am alone, very much alone and every day I miss my mother more than the last&#8212;I
                only keep things right by incessant work. </p>
            <p>It will be the spring before I shall be able to get away&#8212;the early
                spring&#8212;when if feasible
            I shall come over to America for a few months: I think that it will do me a world of
                good.</p>
