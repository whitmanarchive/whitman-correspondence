                <salute>Dearest mother,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Well, I have been out to John Burroughs's again to breakfast this
                morning—we have a nice hot breakfast, buckwheat cakes,
                &amp;c.—It seems to be regular thing, almost every Sunday
                morning—then we sit &amp; talk, &amp; I read the Sunday morning
                papers till about ½ past 10 o'clock—&amp; then I walk down
                here to the office, about a mile &amp; a half—Mother, I have not much
                to write about, only the same old story—</p>

            <p>I believe I told you some time ago, I had been applied to by an English magazine "The
                Broadway," to write something for them—well, I have lately sent them a
                piece of poetry—if they accept it, I shall get pay for it—The
                magazine is printed in London, but sold in New York also.<ptr target="nyp.00278_n1"/>
            </p>

            <p>I wrote to Han last Thursday—I suppose you got your letter last Friday<ptr target="nyp.00278_n2"/>—I have not had any word from Jeff yet<ptr target="nyp.00278_n3"/>—</p>

            <p>We are having some great speeches made in Congress—This last week, there
                have been debates in the Senate, &amp; the Republicans seem thoroughly waked up
                &amp; full of fight<ptr target="nyp.00278_n4"/>—they have
                had the best of it, so far, in the speeches—some of them were first
                rate—I am going up to Congress, next week—havn't been yet, this
                session—I went to Prof. Agassiz' lecture last Friday night<ptr target="nyp.00278_n5"/>—I was very much pleased—</p>

            <p>I pass the time very quietly—some evenings I spend in my attic—I
                have laid in wood, &amp; can have a fire when I want it—I wish you was
                here—I am already making reckoning of coming home on the next
                visit—but when it will be, I can't tell—Mother, I would take a
                morning paper, the Times or something—it would help pass away the
                time—the debates in Congress are quite interesting now—Well,
                dear mother, I believe that is all this time.</p>
