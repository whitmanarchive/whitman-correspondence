            <p>I got your letter dated last Wednesday&#8212;I do not always depend on Swinton's<ptr target="loc.00834_n1"/> accounts&#8212;I think he is apt to make things full as bad as they are, if not worse&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I was so glad to get a letter from Jeff this morning enclosing one from George dated June 1st&#8212;it was so good to see his handwriting once more&#8212;I have not heard any thing of the reg't&#8212;there are all sorts of rumors here, among others that Burnside does not give satisfaction to Grant &amp; Meade, &amp; that it is expected some one else will be placed in command of 9th Corps&#8212;Another rumor, more likely, is that our base of the army is to be changed to Harrison's Landing on James river instead of White House on Pamunky&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I have not felt well again the last two days as I was Tuesday, but I feel a good deal better this morning, I go around, but most of the time feel very little like it&#8212;the doctor tells me I have continued too long in the hospitals, especially in a bad place, armory building, where the worst wounds were, &amp; have absorbed too much of the virus in my system&#8212;but I know it is nothing but what a little relief &amp; sustenance of right sort, will set right&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office&#8212;he is very busy paying off some men whose time is out, they are going home to New York&#8212;I wrote to George yesterday&#8212;we are having very pleasant weather here just now&#8212;Mother, you didn't mention whether Mary had come, so I suppose she has not, I should like to see her &amp; Ansel too<ptr target="loc.00834_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>The wounded still come here in large numbers&#8212;day &amp; night trains of ambulances&#8212;tell Jeff the $10 from Mr Lane for the soldiers came safe&#8212;I shall write to Jeff right away&#8212;I send my love to Mat &amp; all&#8212;Mother, you must try to keep good heart&#8212;</p>
