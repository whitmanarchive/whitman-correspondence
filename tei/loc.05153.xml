            <p>Long &amp; long does it seem since I have had any word or sign from you. I hope all
                goes well &amp; that you have had a pleasant, refreshing summer trip somewhere. All
                goes on much as usual with us.</p>

                    </choice> 21.</hi> Not having felt very well the last month or two, and Giddy
                also seeming to need a little bracing up, we came down to this ancient town by the
                sea&#8212;one of the Cinque Ports&#8212;on Wednesday, and much we like it&#8212;a
                fine open sea&#8212;a delicious "briny odour"&#8212;and inland much that is curious
                and interesting&#8212;for this part of the Kentish Coast&#8212;so near to
                France&#8212;has innumerable old castles, forts, moats, traces everywhere of
                centuries of warfare and of means of defence against our great neighbour. It is a
                fine hilly, woody country, too, and very picturesque these grey massive ruins, many
                of them used now as farm houses, look. The men of Kent are very proud of their
                country and are reckoned a fine race&#8212;tall, muscular, ruddy-complexioned,
                and often too with thick, tawny-red beards&#8212;curious how in our little
                island the differences of race-stock are still so discernible&#8212;keep along
                this same coast to the west only about a couple of hundred miles &amp; you come to
                such a different type&#8212;dark&#8212;blackest and Cornish men.&#8212;I get a nice
                letter now &amp; then from John Burroughs. I also saw this summer two women doctors
                who were very kind &amp; good friends to my darling Bee&#8212;<choice><abbr>Drs.</abbr>
                    <expan>Doctors</expan>
                </choice> Pope&#8212;twin sisters from Boston, whom it did me good to see. They work
                hard&#8212;have a good practice&#8212;&amp; say they don't know what a day's illness
                means so far as they themselves are concerned. They tell me also that the women
                doctors are doing capital work in America&#8212;and that one of them, who was with
                dear Beatrice at the <choice>
                    <abbr>Penn. Med. Col.</abbr><expan>Pennsylvania Medical College</expan></choice>, Dr. Alice Bennett, is the efficient head of the woman's department of a
                large lunatic asylum. We are getting on in England too&#8212;but the field where
                English women doctors find the most work &amp; the best position is India, where as
                the women are not allowed by their male relatives to be attended by men, the
                mortality was immense.&#8212;Herby has taken a better studio than our house
                afforded&#8212;both as to light &amp; size&#8212;&amp; finds the advantage great. I
                expect he is having a delightful walk this brilliant morning with the "Hampstead
                Tramps"&#8212;of whom I think I have told you. They often walk fifteen miles or so on
                Sunday morning.</p>

            <p>Such a glorious afternoon it has been by the sea&#8212;sapphire colour&#8212;the air
                brisk &amp; elastic, yet soft. To-morrow Grace goes home &amp; I shall be all
                alone here.&#8212;I hear of "Specimen Days" in a letter from Australia&#8212;there
                will be a large audience for you there some day, dear Friend. I like what John
                Burroughs has been writing about Carlyle much. We have had nothing but stupidities
                of late about him here&#8212;but there will come a great reaction from all this
                abuse, I have no doubt&#8212;he did put so much gall in his ink sometimes, human
                nature can't be expected to take it altogether meekly. I hope you received my little
                book safely. I should be a hypocrite if I pretended not to care whether you found
                patience to read it&#8212;for I grew to love Mary &amp; Charles Lamb so much during
                my task that I want you to love them too&#8212;&amp; to see what a beautiful
                friendship was theirs with Coleridge.</p>

            <p>How are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whitman and Hattie &amp; Jessie? Send me a few words
                soon.</p>
