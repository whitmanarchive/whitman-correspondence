                <p>Your letter has come this morning—I always read it through, 
                &amp; then in the afternoon read it through a second time—every little item is <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi>—poor Mat, she has indeed had a narrow escape<ptr target="uva.00352_n3"/>—to think how it might have happened by another hair's breadth—We are having beautiful weather here—quite cool, 
                except in the middle of the day—I am feeling well as usual—nothing special or new in the office—all seems to go on smoothly—Mr. Evarts<ptr target="uva.00352_n1"/> is here—Ashton<ptr target="uva.00352_n2"/> has gone to New York for a few days—I have just sent off quite a batch of letters to Hannah—</p></div1>
            
            <div1 type="section"><p><hi rend="italic">Saturday 15th</hi>—I took a sail down to Alexandria yesterday—it is six or eight miles—you go down in a steamer, 
                something like the Brooklyn ferry boats—&amp; to-day I have just 
                been out for nearly two hours—so you see I am not confined 
                very closely—We have not much to do in the office—It is beautiful weather again to-day, cool enough, and I feel very well—It is probable that I shall not take my leave of absence 
                for a few weeks yet—I will send you good word—</p>
            
            <p>There are a great many clerks dismissed, from the Treasury, War 
                &amp; other Departments—several hundreds—&amp; more to be dismissed—it makes a good deal of distress—many have families—as far as appears at present, I expect to stay on as usual—</p>
            
            <p>It is now about one o'clock—a cool breeze is blowing in from the river—Mother dear, I hope you are feeling well to-day, &amp; every thing is going smoothly—I hope George is well, &amp; having good times—I suppose the house must 
                be most finished—You must tell me all about it, when you write<ptr target="uva.00352_n4"/>—</p></div1>
            
            <div1 type="section"><div2 type="sub-section"><p><hi rend="italic">Sunday forenoon</hi>—16th—I am sitting here by myself in the office—it is warm, but pleasant—It is pretty dull here in Washington now that Congress is away—</p></div2>
            
            <div2 type="sub-section"><p><hi rend="italic">Afternoon</hi>—½ past 3—We have had a hot day so far—had a good dinner—good roast beef &amp; apple pie—had company to dinner—I have come around to the office to sit in quiet awhile, 
                by my big open window—nice old window—I have spent so many quiet comfortable hours by it, 
                I shall be sorry enough when I leave it—I never get tired looking out, 
                there is river &amp; hills &amp; gardens &amp; trees—can see ten or twelve miles—&amp; boats sailing—I am going up to O'Connors towards 7 o'clock as usual—I am working at my leisure on my little book<ptr target="uva.00352_n5"/>—I dont know whether 
                I have spoken of it before—in prose—those pieces in the <hi rend="italic">Galaxy</hi> form 
                portions of it—it is on political &amp; literary subjects—It is a real pleasure to me—the new edition of Leaves of Grass is all ready fixed—so I don't bother with it any more—</p></div2></div1>
            
            <div1 type="section"><p><hi rend="italic">Monday forenoon</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Aug 17</hi>—Well, Mother, I will close up my letter, 
                &amp; send it off to-day—I went out to O'Connors as usual last evening 
                &amp; staid till after 11 o'clock—They have got another house, 
                &amp; move in about a month—We are all quite busy to-day in the office—Mr. Evarts &amp; Ashton are both here now, &amp; we have to fly around—Well I enjoy it just as well when I am busy during office hours, 
                or rather I like it better—the pleasant weather continues—we need rain—dear mother, how are you getting along, &amp; how is the rheumatism?
