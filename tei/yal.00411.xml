        <salute>Dearest mother<ptr target="n0705"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good wood
        fire in the stove&#8212;have been alone all the evening&#8212;I sit up as much as I can,
        especially evenings&#8212;as I sleep better afterwards&#8212;I rec'd a letter from Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/>
        to&#8211;day,<ptr target="yal.00411_n1"/> Matty<ptr target="n0707"/> was as well as at last
        accounts&#8212;about the same&#8212;no worse&#8212;I also rec'd a letter from Heyde<ptr
          target="yal.00411_n2"/>&#8212;he said Han<ptr target="n0285"/> was well as
        usual&#8212;</p>

      <p>I have been sitting up nearly all day&#8212;&amp; have less distress in the head than I
        have had&#8212;which is a great gain&#8212;I had a letter from Mrs. Price<ptr target="n0483"
        /> to&#8211;day&#8212;she invites me to come &amp; stop awhile there, as soon as I can
        journey&#8212;</p>

      <p>Mother, it is kind of <hi rend="italic">company</hi> to write to you&#8212;it is very
        lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room&#8212;about 9 Charles Eldridge<ptr
          target="n0210"/> comes in &amp; assists me to soak my feet in hot water, &amp; then I turn
        in&#8212;(I have my <choice>
          <orig>trowsers</orig>
          <reg>trousers</reg>
        </choice> on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)&#8212;</p>

      <p>Friday noon <lb/>Feb. 14 </p>

      <p>Mother, I am sitting up again to&#8211;day&#8212;passed a comfortable night, &amp; as soon
        as it is favorable weather I shall try to get <hi rend="italic">started</hi> for
        outside&#8212;first, to get down stairs&#8212;&amp; then perhaps across the
        street&#8212;</p>

      <p>3 o'clock </p>

      <p>I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest&#8212;Mrs.
          O'Connor<ptr target="n0450"/> has just been to see me&#8212;brought a basket of nice
        things&#8212;</p>

      <p>Mother dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday&#8212;I send you Harper's<ptr
          target="n0290"/> &amp; Frank Leslie's<ptr target="n0246"/>&#8212;I am having a very fair
        day to&#8211;day&#8212;it is moderate &amp; pleasant here, but mostly cloudy&#8212;I have
        been quite occupied writing several letters about business<ptr target="yal.00411_n3"
        />&#8212;have set up all day, with the exception of an hour&#8212;Love to you, dear mother, </p>
