            <p>You or Jeff must try to write as soon as you receive this &amp; let me know how little Sis is, tell me if she got entirely over the croup &amp; how she is&#8212;also about George's trunks,<ptr target="loc.00811_n1"/> I do hope he recovered them, it was such a misfortune&#8212;I want to hear the end of it, I am in hopes I shall hear that he has got them&#8212;I have not seen in the papers whether the 51st has left New York yet&#8212;Mother, I want to hear all about home &amp; all the occurrences, especially the two things I have just mentioned, &amp; how you are, dearest mother, you must write me exactly how you are for somehow I was thinking from your letters lately whether you was as well as usual or not&#8212;write how my dear sister Mat is too, &amp; whether you are still going to stay there in Portland av. the coming year&#8212;Well, dear mother, I am just the same here, nothing new, I am well &amp; hearty, &amp; constantly moving around among the wounded &amp; sick&#8212;there are a great many of the latter coming up&#8212;the hospitals here are quite full&#8212;lately they have [been] picking out in the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered, &amp; sending them back to their regiments, they seem to be determined to strengthen the army this spring, to the utmost&#8212;they are sending down many to their reg'ts that are not fit to go, in my opinion&#8212;then there are squads &amp; companies &amp; reg'ts too passing through here in one steady stream going down to front, returning from furlough home&#8212;but then there are quite a number leaving the army on furlough, re-enlisting, &amp; going north for a while&#8212;they pass through here quite largely&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, Lewis Brown is getting quite well, he will soon be able to have a wooden leg put on, he is very restless &amp; active, &amp; wants to go around all the time&#8212;</p>
            <p>Sam Beatty<ptr target="loc.00811_n2"/> is here in Washington&#8212;We have had quite a snow storm, but is clear &amp; sunny to-day here, but sloshy, I am wearing my army boots&#8212;any thing but the dust&#8212;Dear mother, I want to see you &amp; Sis, &amp; Mat &amp; all very much&#8212;if I can get a chance I think I shall come home for a while&#8212;I want to try to bring out a book of poems, a new one to be called "Drum Taps" &amp; I want to come to New York for that purpose too&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I havn't given up the project of lecturing<ptr target="loc.00811_n3"/> either&#8212;but whatever I do, I shall for the main thing devote myself for years to come to these wounded &amp; sick, what little I can&#8212;Well good bye, dear mother, for present&#8212;write soon&#8212;</p>
