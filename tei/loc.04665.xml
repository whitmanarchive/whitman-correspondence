            <p>I went round last evening to call on Mrs Rogers,<ptr target="loc.04665_n1"/> &#38; thought perhaps I might find
                you there, but the house was shut up &#38; nobody home&#8212;the lady opposite told
                me Mrs R was down to Bridgeton to her brother's&#8212;told me Jane was up Thursday
                or Friday to get some things&#8212;Jane said Mrs R was getting along pretty well,

                down at the pond, the first three summers '76, '77 and '78 I was down there at your house&#8212;We could not get my
