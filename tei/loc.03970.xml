I have wrote to you more for to thank you for the dollar than anything else as I dont have any money but what you <choice><sic>giv</sic><corr>give</corr></choice> me, I don't know but what it is as well for me not to have any for if I haven't any, I don't smoke any and it is best for me not to I guess, I have not smoked any for nearly a week, so you <choice><sic>se</sic><corr>see</corr></choice> I am all alone now for when I have no company I can get a Cigar and pass the time away by <choice><sic>myselfe</sic><corr>myself</corr></choice>, I did not <choice><sic>se</sic><corr>see</corr></choice> Lizzie last night and I think that I will give up going

            with her if she will be willing for I have so much to think of just at present that it will be best for me, although I love her as well as ever, but I must get in some business before I think of the girls. I am doing well at the Telegraph business they all tell me and like it first <choice><sic>rait</sic><corr>rate</corr></choice> but don't like the country. I will stay here <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> I am fit for an office, though, I think that I will be by the time spring opens if I have good luck. I was very <choice><sic>lonly</sic><corr>lonely</corr></choice> Saturday night. I wanted to come up to see you but did not get to. Cousin Homer was over to <choice><sic>se</sic><corr>see</corr></choice> me Yesterday and <choice><sic>staied</sic><corr>stayed</corr></choice> all night, and came over with me this morning and went from here to Philadelphia, he is looking for a situation at telegraphing, him and Ed went to Haddonfield in Ed's new wagon. I have had one ride in it.</p>
