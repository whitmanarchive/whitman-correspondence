            </opener>
            <p>I came across your, and now my, <hi rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi> when I was
                eighteen, that is a year ago, and was much surprised at what I found there.</p>
            <p>I read, at one sitting, about half of the book and did not take it up again until the
                other day. I said, "I'll read this later on when I can understand it and now I have
                read it through and kissed it.</p>
            <p>I took it to my mother and "wheedled" her as she says, and got her to give the
                "leaves" to me. Then I went to Philip Bourke Marston,<ptr target="n0383"/> the blind
                poet and borrowed your other volume <hi rend="underline">Two Rivulets</hi> and have
                this moment finished it. At the page where you breathed on and pressed your <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02120.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> hand, <hi
                    rend="underline">I</hi> also pressed my hand and so we have had a hand shake.
                You say also that you want America to have some original music, composed by an
                American and to be as entirely American as Beethoven is German.</p>
            <p>Beethovens' Music is the Music of the Universe, by a German</p>
            <p>I will compose the Universal Music, and it will be by an American.</p>
            <p>I <choice><abbr>havn't</abbr><expan>haven't</expan></choice> any patriotism, Sectarianism or party feelings whatever and I believe such
                feelings only beget disease, and in fact are an outcome of disease.</p>
            <p>I am a particle of the Universe and whatever I may do, will be a particle of the
                Universe.</p>
            <p>I am what's called a "Strict Vegetarian" that is I do not take <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.02120.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> animal so called "food" in any
                shape not even milk and eggs and consequently have health.</p>
            <p>Seeing that you gave
                alcohol as medicine, to the sufferers of the late war, I think you will be
                interested in a new work that has just come out here in England (and shortly to be
                published in America by Ginn Heath Co, Boston.)</p>
            <p>It is making a great stir in the medical profession and elsewhere, and although only
                out a few weeks, the 1500 Edition, is gone, which means a great deal in England. The
                title is&#8212;<hi rend="underline">The Foundation of Death</hi>.<ptr
                    target="loc.02120_n1"/></p>
            <p>Next month I go to Derby Shire to spend a month among the Mountains. How I wish you
                could go with me!</p> 
            <p>I am saddened by the terrible <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02120.004_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> condition of London and I am working hard to get out of it and
                back to America, where I shall bury my physical self in the Catskills or some where
                else and give my spiritual self more than ever to the world.</p>
            <p>So long! Dear Walt. I feel that I know you, how can I help it! I love you! and you
                love me! And you have done my brothers &#38; sisters, the race, good. They, whom you
                have taken by the ear and whispered to and me whom you have loved. And you are much
                to all and will be more and more so.</p>
