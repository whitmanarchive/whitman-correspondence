         <p>I<ptr target="med.00321_n100"/> found I could get nothing but promises from the booksellers for the present, so I sent you today a package of such books as I could pick from my own shelves, together with some newspapers&#8212;a variety in which I hope you will find a few things to suit your purpose. (Per Adams Ex., prepaid.)</p>  
            <p>I can send you more newspapers&#8212;and perhaps more books&#8212;in a few days, if you wish for another bundle. I have no copy of Jackwood, and could not get one here, or I would have sent it. A new edition will be out soon, when I will see that you get a copy. You will find in the package two copies of the Drummer Boy, one of which I wish you would leave at Mr. Chase's.</p>
            <p>I got your letter yesterday. The day before I went to see your friend, Babbitt, whom I found apparently much improved, certainly brighter&#8212;perhaps he was getting better acquainted with me, and perhaps because his descriptive list had come, and he was expecting to be taken away yesterday by his friends; or it may be he is really better. He felt that the list came through your influence, and appeared very grateful to you for it.</p>
            <p>The word you sent I have forwarded to Shillaber.<ptr target="med.00321_n2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Good-bye, my dear friend, and may the good angels help you in your good work.</p>
