               <salute>Dearest Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I rec'd your letter &amp; sent the one you sent for George immediately&#8212;he must have got it the next day&#8212;I had got one from him before yours arrived&#8212;I mean to go to Annapolis &amp; see him&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, we expect a commencement of the fighting below very soon, there is every indication of it&#8212;we have had about as severe rain storms here lately as I ever see&#8212;it is middling pleasant now&#8212;there are exciting times in Congress<ptr target="loc.00817_n1"/>&#8212;the Copperheads are getting furious, &amp; want to recognize the Southern Confederacy&#8212;this is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such villains after what they have done, and after what has transpired the last three years&#8212;After first Fredericksburgh I felt discouraged myself, &amp; doubted whether our rulers could carry on the war&#8212;but that has past away, the war <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be carried on&#8212;&amp; I would willingly go myself in the ranks if I thought it would profit more than at present, &amp; I don't know sometimes but I shall as it is&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, you dont know what a feeling a man gets after being in the active sights &amp; influences of the camp, the Army, the wounded &amp;c.&#8212;he gets to have a deep feeling he never experienced before<ptr target="loc.00817_n2"/>&#8212;the flag, the tune of Yankee Doodle, &amp; similar things, produce an effect on a fellow never such before&#8212;I have seen some bring tears on the men's cheeks, &amp; others turn pale, under such circumstances<ptr target="loc.00817_n3"/>&#8212;I have a little flag (it belonged to one of our cavalry reg'ts) presented to me by one of the wounded&#8212;it was taken by the secesh in a cavalry fight, &amp; rescued by our men in a bloody little skirmish, it cost three men's lives, just to get one little flag, four by three&#8212;our men rescued it, &amp; tore it from the breast of a dead rebel&#8212;all that just for the name of getting their little banner back again&#8212;this man that got it was very badly wounded, &amp; they let him keep it&#8212;I was with him a good deal, he wanted to give me something he said, he didn't expect to live, so he gave me the little banner as a keepsake&#8212;I mention this, Mother, to show you a specimen of the feeling&#8212;there isn't a reg't, cavalry or infantry, that wouldn't do the same, on occasion&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tuesday morning April 12th
Mother, I will finish my letter this morning&#8212;it is a beautiful day to-day&#8212;I was up in Congress very late last night,<ptr target="loc.00817_n4"/> the house had a very excited night session about expelling the men that want to recognize the Southern Confederacy&#8212;You ought to hear the soldiers talk&#8212;they are excited to madness&#8212;we shall probably have hot times here not in the Army alone&#8212;the soldiers are true as the north star&#8212;I send you a couple of envelopes, &amp; one to George&#8212;Write how you are, dear Mother, &amp; all the rest&#8212;I want to see you all&#8212;Jeff, my dear brother, I wish you was here, &amp; Mat too&#8212;Write how sis is&#8212;I am well as usual, indeed first rate every way&#8212;I want to come on in a month, &amp; try to print my "Drum Taps"<ptr target="loc.00817_n5"/>&#8212;I think it may be a success pecuniarily too&#8212;Dearest Mother, I hope this will find you entirely well, &amp; dear sister Mat &amp; all.</p>
