            <p>I write a few lines to tell you how I find the folks at home&#8212;Both my mother &amp; brother George looked much better than I expected&#8212;Mother is quite well, considering&#8212;she goes about her household affairs pretty much the same as ever, &amp; is cheerful.</p>
            <p>My brother would be in what I would almost call fair condition, if it were not that his legs are affected&#8212;it seems to me it is rheumatism, following the fever he had<ptr target="nyp.00198_n2"/>&#8212;but I don't know&#8212;He goes to bed quite sleepy &amp; falls to sleep&#8212;but then soon wakes, &amp; frequently little or no more sleep that night&#8212;he most always leaves the bed, &amp; comes downstairs, &amp; passes the night on the sofa. He goes out most every day though&#8212;some days has to lay by&#8212;He is going to report to Annapolis promptly when his furlough is up&#8212;I told him I had no doubt I could get it extended, but he does not wish it&#8212;He says little, but is in first rate spirits.</p>
            <p>I am feeling finely&#8212;&amp; never enjoyed a visit home more than I am doing this.</p>
            <p>I find myself perplexed about printing my book. All the printers tell me I could not pick a more inopportune time&#8212;that in ten days prices of paper, composition &amp;c will all be very much lower &amp;c. I shall decide tomorrow.</p>
            <p>My brother Jeff wishes me to give you his sincerest thanks for your good will &amp;c in the matter of the engineer's situation&#8212;Mother says he has talked much about it, &amp; feels your kindness in it thoroughly.<ptr target="nyp.00198_n3"/>
            </p>
            <p>Martha &amp; the little girls are well. My sister at Burlington Vt. is not well, &amp; mother will probably pay a long visit there this summer.</p>
