               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Well here I sit this forenoon in a corner by the window in Major Hapgood's office&#8212;all the Potomac &amp; Maryland &amp; Virginia hills in sight&#8212;writing my Tuesday letter to you, dearest mother&#8212;Major has gone home to Boston on sick leave, &amp; only the clerk &amp; me occupy the office &amp; he not much of the time&#8212;at the present moment there are two wounded officers come in to get their pay, one has crutches&#8212;the other is drest in the light blue uniform of the invalid corps&#8212;way up here in the 5th floor it is pretty hard scratching for cripples &amp; very weak men to journey up here&#8212;often they come up here very weary &amp; faint, &amp; then find out they can't get their money, some red tape hitch, &amp; the poor soldiers look so disappointed&#8212;it always makes me feel bad&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, we are having perfect weather here nowadays, both night &amp; day&#8212;the nights are wonderful, for the last three nights as I have walked home from the hospital pretty late, it has seemed to me like a dream, the moon &amp; sky ahead of any thing I ever see before&#8212;Mother, do you hear any thing from George, I wrote to him yesterday &amp; sent him your last letter &amp; Jeff's enclosed&#8212;I shall send him some papers to-day&#8212;I send papers quite often&#8212;(why hasn't Jeff sent me the Union<ptr target="loc.00791_n1"/> with my letter in&#8212;I want much to see it, &amp; whether they have misprinted it.)</p>
            <p>Mother, I dont think the 51st has been in any of the fighting we know of down there yet&#8212;what is to come of course nobody can tell&#8212;As to Burnside I suppose you know he is among his <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, &amp; I think this quite important, for such the main body of East Tennesseans are, &amp; are far truer Americans any how than the Copperheads of the North&#8212;the Tennesseans will fight for us too&#8212;Mother, you have no idea how the soldiers, sick &amp;c. (I mean the American ones to a man) all feel about the copperheads, they never speak of them without a curse &amp; I hear them say with an air that shows they mean it, they would shoot them sooner than they would a rebel&#8212;Mother, the troops from Meade's army are passing through here night &amp; day, going west &amp; so down to reinforce Rosecrans I suppose&#8212;the papers are not permitted to mention it, but it is so&#8212;two Army Corps I should think have mostly passed&#8212;they go through night &amp; day&#8212;I hear the whistle of the locomotive screaming away any time at night when I wake up, &amp; the rumbling of the trains&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother dear, you must write to me soon, &amp; so must Jeff&#8212;I thought Mat was going to send me a great long letter, I am always looking for it, I hope it will be full of every thing about family matters &amp; doings, &amp; how every body really is&#8212;I go to Major's box three or four times a day&#8212;I want to hear also about Andrew, &amp; indeed about every one of you &amp; every thing, nothing is too trifling, nothing uninteresting.</p>
            <p>O mother, who do you think I got a letter from, two or three days ago&#8212;Aunt Fanny, Ansel's mother&#8212;She sent it by a young man, a wounded soldier who has been home to Farmingdale on furlough, &amp; lately returned&#8212;she writes a first rate letter, Quaker all over<ptr target="loc.00791_n2"/>&#8212;I shall answer it&#8212;She says Mary &amp; Ansel &amp; all are well&#8212;I have rec'd another letter from Mrs Price, she has not good health, I am sorry for her from my heart, she is a good noble woman, no better kind&#8212;Mother, I am in the hospitals as usual&#8212;I stand it better the last three weeks than ever before&#8212;I go among the worst fevers &amp; wounds with impunity&#8212;I go among the small pox, &amp;c just the same&#8212;I feel to go without apprehension, &amp; so I go&#8212;nobody else goes, &amp; as the darkey said there at Charleston when the boat run on a flat &amp; the reb sharpshooters were peppering them, <hi rend="italic">somebody must jump in de water</hi> (&amp; shove the boat off)&#8212;</p>
