            </opener>
            <p>William is on his way to Bar Harbor, Maine, care Dr. Kinnear, Wall's cottage. <choice>

                    <reg>William</reg>
                </choice> was disposed to try Dr. K. as soon as he heard of his method, which is Dr.
                Chapman's, with which <choice>
                    <orig>Wm.</orig>
                    <reg>William</reg>
                </choice> was familiar, applications <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="loc.02947.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> of heat &#38; cold to the
                    spine.<ptr target="loc.02947_n1"/> Probably <choice>
                    <orig>Wm.</orig>
                    <reg>William</reg>
                </choice> wrote you, he said he should, when he read your letter to me. The Ashtons
                were very anxious to have him try Dr. Kinnear, &#38; William feels that he ought&#8212;to
                try any one who gives him reasonable assurance of help. He says he wants "either his
                legs, or <hi rend="underline">wings</hi>," as locomotion of some <pb
                    xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02947.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> sort is
                desirable. </p> 
            <p>I write at this moment to ask you to please <hi rend="underline">not tell any one
                    where <choice>
                        <orig>Wm.</orig>

                    </choice> is,</hi> I mean not any one who will speak of it, he asked me to
                caution all the friends; above all he says <hi rend="underline">don't let it get
                    into the papers</hi>, for already some vile creatures are grumbling at his
                vacation; so you <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.02947.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                will kindly bear it in mind. Mr. Kimball<ptr target="loc.02947_n2"/> thought he
                better not let it be known. He (W.) said he should make Dr. K. tell him at once
                whether he could help him. He shows a deal of energy in starting off as he does,
                &#38; as to his courage it is simply <hi rend="underline">sublime</hi>, &#38; he
                puts all my <hi rend="underline">theoretical</hi> trust to shame by his practical
                application <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.02947.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/> of
                it. A friend here offered to go all the way to Bar Harbor with him, but he said it
                was all "nonsense", that he found plenty of people ready to jump to help him, his
                crutch is very appealing, &#38; now he uses that &#38; his cane <hi rend="underline"
                    >both</hi>. At any rate, he is out of this awful heat &#38; sultriness. I hope
                you keep up under it. To-day it is <pb xml:id="leaf003v"
                    facs="loc.02947.006_large.jpg" type="verso"/> raining here, for the first time. </p>
            <p>Dear Walt, the other day I found a package of letters belonging to you carefully put
                away, the Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> correspondence, &#38; as a part of history
                valuable, &#38; I return them to you to-day by this mail, but in another &#38; large
                envelope. </p>
            <p>Let me hear from you soon if you get them <pb xml:id="leaf004r"
                    facs="loc.02947.007_large.jpg" type="recto"/> safely. I send all but had to
                separate the bundle, as it was too thick for my envelope. </p>
            <closer>
                <salute>With all good wishes, as ever, </salute>
