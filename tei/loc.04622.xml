                <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I received the book quite safely this morning,<ptr target="loc.04622_n1"/> &amp;
                thank you very much for sending it, it was a very good thought of Edward
                    Carpenter<ptr target="n0141b"/> to ask you to send it to me, &amp; just like him
                to know how pleased I should be to receive it from your own hands. I do indeed feel
                proud to have it direct from the Author, &amp; to have my name written in it by
                himself. I should like to take this opportunity if you will allow me, of thanking
                you for all the help I have <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="3"/>
                &amp; do get, <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.02432_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                from your books. You do not know me, I have never spoken one word to you til to-day,
                but I know you. You have spoken to me many words of help, &amp; encouragement &amp;
                reproof, &amp; direction, &amp; of all kinds &amp; I feel very grateful to you for
                them, &amp; for all the pleasure I have had in reading your books, &amp; I shall always be
                grateful to Mr Carpenter also, for introducing them to me. They contain messages for
                all times &amp; people, &amp; for all sorts &amp; conditions of men, but it seems to
                me they are especially good &amp; most glad tidings to common place,
                ordinary plain people, with few gifts
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.02433_large.jpg" type="recto"/> &amp; no graces
                like myself. Also most truly a message of love &amp; tenderness &amp; sympathy to the despised &amp; downtrodden of the earth. I so
                often think of these words of yours, "Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as
                the well off just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession." I
                shall never forget how struck I was with the truth &amp; beauty of verses 16 17 &amp; 18 on page 105 in Leaves of
                Grass the first time I read them, it so often <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="medium">came</unclear> to me as I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ef" cert="medium">go</unclear> about amongst the sick &amp; poor, especially the poor in the Workhouse Hospital. That
                for many people there seems no place at all no one wants them <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc_vm.02434_large.jpg" type="verso"/> everyone seems glad when they drop
                out of the procession, &amp; yet most of those men &amp; women in the hospital, have
                worked hard much too hard as their bent backs declare, all their lives. There is something
                very very wrong somewhere &amp; we shall have to answer for it in one way or
                another, but I will not trouble you with more words of mine. Forgive me writing so
                much. I did not intend when I began. I should like to send the money for the book
                &amp; the postage, but I do not know the price of the book. Will you kindly send me
                the price on a post card. Again thanking you I am </p>

                <salute>Yours very Gratefully &amp; Respectfully</salute>
