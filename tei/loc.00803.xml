            <p>I wrote a few lines about five days ago<ptr target="loc.00803_n3"/> &amp; sent on to Armory Square, but as I have not heard from it I suppose you have gone on to Michigan. I got your letter of Nov 10th,<ptr target="loc.00803_n4"/> &amp; it gave me much comfort. Douglass, I shall return to Washington about the 24th, so when you write direct to care of Major Hapgood, paymaster U S A, Washington D. C.&#8212;Dearest comrade, I only write this, lest the one I wrote five days ago may not reach you from the hospital. I am still here at my mother's, &amp; feel as if [I] have had enough of going around New York&#8212;enough of amusements, suppers, drinking, &amp; what is called <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi>&#8212;Dearest son, it would be more pleasure if we could be together just in quiet, in some plain way of living, with some good employment &amp; reasonable income, where I could have you often with me, than all the dissipations &amp; amusements of this great city&#8212;O I hope things may work so that we can yet have each other's society&#8212;for I cannot bear the thought of being separated from you&#8212;I know I am a great fool about such things, but I tell you the truth, dear son. I do not think one night has passed in New York or Brooklyn when I have been at the theatre or opera or afterward to some supper party or carouse made by the young fellows for me, but what amid the play or the singing, I would perhaps suddenly think of you&#8212;&amp; the same at the gayest supper party, of men, where all was fun &amp; noise &amp; laughing &amp; drinking, of a dozen young men, &amp; I among them, I would see your face before me in my thought as I have seen it so often there in Ward G, &amp; my amusement or drink would be all turned to nothing, &amp; I would realize how happy it would be if I could leave all the fun &amp; noise &amp; the crowd &amp; be with you&#8212;I don't wish to disparage my dear friends &amp; acquaintances here, there are so many of them &amp; all so good, many so educated, traveled, &amp;c., some so handsome &amp; witty, some rich &amp;c., some among the literary class&#8212;many young men&#8212;all good&#8212;many of them educated &amp; polished, &amp; brilliant in conversation, &amp;c<ptr target="loc.00803_n5"/>&#8212;&amp; I thought I valued their society &amp; friendship&#8212;&amp; I do, for it is worth valuing&#8212;But, Douglass, I will tell you the truth, you are so much closer to me than any of them that there is no comparison&#8212;there has never passed so much between them &amp; me as we have&#8212;besides there is something that takes down all artificial accomplishments, &amp; that is a manly &amp; loving soul&#8212;My dearest comrade, I am sitting here writing to you very late at night&#8212;I have been reading&#8212;it is indeed after 12, &amp; my mother &amp; all the rest have gone to bed two hours ago, &amp; I am here alone writing to you, &amp; I enjoy it too, although it is not much, yet I know it will please you, dear boy&#8212;If you get this, you must write &amp; tell me where &amp; how you are. I hope you are quite well, &amp; with your dear wife, for I know you have long wished to be with her, &amp; I wish you to give her my best respects &amp; love too.</p>
            <p>Douglass, I haven't written any news, for there is nothing particular I have to write. Well, it is now past midnight, pretty well on to 1 o'clock, &amp; my sheet is most written out&#8212;so, my dear darling boy, I must bid you good night, or rather good morning &amp; I hope it may be God's will we shall yet be with each other&#8212;but I must indeed bid you good night, my dear loving comrade, &amp; the blessing of God on you by night &amp; day, my darling boy.<ptr target="loc.00803_n6"/>
