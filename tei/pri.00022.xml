                All here goes as well as could be expected&#8212;even better&#8212;except that the <hi rend="underline">new edition</hi> 
                is rather slow in getting ready to be sent to subscribers, but will very soon be ready, &amp; all 
                the good friends &amp; subscribers will have their copies carefully sent to their addresses by mail 
                prepaid, (as I find this is the best way)&#8212;There were really only 100 of the first edition

                and they have become exhausted&#8212;that is the reason of some present delay&#8212;but, 
                as said in former letter, <hi rend="underline">every order &amp; purchase will be faithfully supplied</hi> (only <hi rend="underline">let the address 
                of the friend be full &amp; plain, in every instance</hi>, the same as they have been hitherto)&#8212;&amp;

                Geo.

                of course was for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> to keep, as your name was written in it by me.)
            </p>
            
            <p>I have not yet <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> my pay for the little <hi rend="underline">Man-of-War-Bird</hi> in <hi rend="underline">Athenaeum</hi><ptr target="pri.00022_n7"/> nor the prose piece on <hi rend="underline">the War</hi> in the <hi rend="underline">Examiner</hi>.<ptr target="pri.00022_n8"/> If convenient the editors can send to me by p.o. money order, as I find that very straight &amp; sure.</p>
            
            <p>&#8212;Joaquin Miller comes occasionally to see me&#8212;his visits are pleasant to me&#8212;Did you get the <hi rend="underline">Pre-Raphaelite</hi> 
                article in the <hi rend="underline">Galaxy</hi> I sent?<ptr target="pri.00022_n10"/> Also <choice><abbr>J.

            <p>Tennyson sent £5 at once to Buchanan (on the latter's letter) who sent it to me&#8212;I <choice><orig>havn't</orig><reg>haven't</reg></choice> written 
                lately to T.,<ptr target="pri.00022_n13"/> as I supposed him abroad on the continent&#8212;but I intend to write soon&#8212;&amp; 
                send him a set of my books&#8212;I am not at all sure that A. T. <hi rend="underline">sees my poems</hi>&#8212;but <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="underline">I do his</hi></hi>, &amp; strongly, 
                (&amp; there perhaps I have the advantage of him)&#8212;but I think <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="underline">he sees me</hi></hi>&#8212;&amp; nothing could have 
                evidenced more courtesy, &amp; manliness, &amp; hospitality, than his letters to me have shown, for five years.
            </p>
            
            <p>Buchanan has sent me six or seven names, (&amp; a cheque)&#8212;will all soon be supplied,
