                <reg>received</reg>
            </choice> this afternoon, &#38; glad to hear from you &#38; the
                folks&#8212;I hear from you now &#38; then by Hoag<ptr target="prc.00073_n2"/> or
                Burr, who tell me they meet you up here frequently&#8212;(I wish you had said how
                Hieneken is getting along&#8212;is he getting better?)</p>
            <p>Well, Hank, my Boston tramp, lecture, &#38;c. turned out far ahead of what I had any
                idea of&#8212;it was not a very large room, but it was packed full (at &#36;1 a head)
                &#38; they say there never was a more <hi rend="italic">high toned crowd</hi>
                collected in the town&#8212;full half were ladies, &#38; I never saw finer
                ones&#8212;I had good quarters at the principal hotel, the Revere House,
                (dead-headed, the proprietor, Mr Ferrin invited me to stay as long as I
                liked)&#8212;&#38; callers all the time&#8212;So, boy, you see how your uncle was
                    <hi rend="italic">set up</hi>&#8212;&#38; yet I am going to speak to all my old
                friends just the same! !</p>
            <p>Have had several little jobs writing lately&#8212;<choice><orig>Phila:</orig><reg>Philadelphia</reg>
            </choice> and N. Y. papers<ptr

                of the latter city next Monday or Tuesday with my piece in)&#8212;<choice><orig>Havn't</orig><reg>Haven't</reg>
                </choice> felt very
                well lately&#8212;a real bad spell last night &#38; this forenoon&#8212;don't feel
                right living in the city any how, after the summer comes on&#8212;very possibly
                shall go off to Canada again, as Dr and Mrs B[ucke] wish me to, &#38; write
                strongly&#8212;</p>
            <p>I sent you a little book of poetry by a boy 13 years old, in Pennsylvania, he sent it
                to me with a nice letter<ptr target="prc.00073_n4"/>&#8212;Well, Hank, my sheet is
                short &#38; most full, &#38; I must come to a close&#8212;I gather by your letter
                that you are in good spirits&#8212;love to you &#38; God bless you&#8212;I am sorry
                enough to hear your mother is unwell&#8212;Susan, my dear friend, I hope when this
                comes you will be all right&#8212;</p>

            <postscript>
                <p>I suppose your mother got a letter &#38; some papers from Boston,<ptr
                        target="prc.00073_n5"/> as I sent them, &#38; of course supposed you would
                    all read them&#8212;my best love to your mother &#38; father &#38; I want you to
                    let them read this&#8212;</p>
