            <p>There is nothing perhaps more than you see in the N Y papers&#8212;the fighting down in the field on the 6th I think ended in our favor, though with pretty severe losses to some of our divisions&#8212;the fighting is about 70 miles from here &amp; 50 from Richmond&#8212;on the 7th &amp; 8th followed up by the rebel army hauling off, they say retreating, &amp; Meade pursuing&#8212;it is quite mixed yet, but I guess we have the best of it&#8212;if we really have, Richmond is a goner, for they cannot do any better than they have done&#8212;how much the 9th corps was in the fight, &amp; where, I cannot tell yet, but from the wounded I have seen I dont think that corps was deeply in&#8212;I have seen 300 wounded, they came in last night, I asked for men of 9th corps, but could not find any at all&#8212;these 300 men were not badly wounded, mostly in arms, hands, trunk of body, &amp;c.&#8212;they could all walk, though some had an awful time of it&#8212;they had to fight their way, with the worst in the middle, out of the region of Fredericksburgh, &amp; so on where they could get across the Rappahannock &amp; get where they found transportation to Washington&#8212;the gov't has decided (or rather Gen Meade has) to occupy Fredericksburgh,<ptr target="loc.00825_n1"/> for depot &amp; hospitals&#8212;(I think that a first rate decision)&#8212;so the wounded men will receive quick attention &amp; surgery, instead of being racked through the long journey up here&#8212;still may come in here&#8212;Mother, my impression is that we have no great reason for alarm or sadness about George so far&#8212;of course I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> nothing&#8212;Well good by, dearest mother,</p>
