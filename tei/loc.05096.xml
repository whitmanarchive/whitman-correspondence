            </opener>
            <p>Your welcome letter to hand.<!--<ptr target="loc.05096_n1"/>--> I have longed for a word from you&#8212;could not write
                myself&#8212;was stricken dumb&#8212;nay, there is nothing but silence for me still.<!--<ptr target="n3071"/>-->
                Herby<!--<ptr target="n0262"/>--> wrote to Mrs. Stafford<!--<ptr target="n0817"/>--> first, thinking that so the shock would come less
                abruptly to you.</p>
            <p>I heard of you at Concord in a kind long letter from Frederick Holland, with whose
                wife you had some conversation. Indeed all that sympathy and warm &#38; true words
                of love &#38; sorrow &#38; highest admiration &#38; esteem for my darling could do
                to comfort me I have had&#8212;and most &#38; best from America. And many of her
                poor patients at Edinburgh went sobbing from the door when they heard they should
                see her no more.</p>
            <p>The report of your health is comforting dear friend. Mine too is better&#8212;I am
                able to take walks again&#8212;though still liable to sudden attacks of difficult
                breathing.</p>
            <p>Herby is working hard&#8212;has just been disappointed over a competition design
                which he sent in to the Royal Academy&#8212;a very poor &#38; specious work
                obtaining the premium&#8212;but is no whit discouraged &#38; has no need to be, for
                he is making great progress&#8212;works hard, loves his work &#38; is of the stuff
                where of great painters are made, I am persuaded&#8212;so he can afford to wait.
                Giddy<!--<ptr target="n0890"/>--> is not quite so well &#38; strong as I could wish, but there seems nothing
                serious. She is working diligently at the development of her voice&#8212;&#38; is
                learning German. Dr. Bucke's<!--<ptr target="n0119"/>--> friend, Mr. Buxton Forman,<!--<ptr target="n0240 "/>--> &#38; his wife are very
                warm, staunch friends of Herby's.</p>
            <p>Please give my love to your sister, and tell her that her good letter spoke the right
                words to me &#38; that I shall write before very long. Thanks for the paper, dear
                friend&#8212;&#38; for those that came when I was too overwhelmed but which I have
                since read with deep interest&#8212;those about your visit to your birthplace. With love from us all&#8212;good-bye, dearest Friend.</p>
