                <salute>Dear Walt,</salute>
            </opener>  
            <p>I got yours of the 4th instant, written on the back of Kennedy's,<ptr target="loc.03299_n1"
                /> and meant to have written you long before, as well as after, but have been in a
                wretched condition with the "misery in my back," as the colored brother calls it. I don't improve in my back and legs as rapidly as I
                ought, and am nearly as lame and heavy as you are, but keep hoping.</p>
            <p>I have wanted to hear how you are, especially your eyes, which you don't mention. The
                state of your eyes worries <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03299.002_large.jpg"
                    type="verso"/> me more than anything else about you.</p>
            <p>Did you see the enclosed, cut from the <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi>, from the
                great Italian fortnightly? The article must be a splendid one to bear such
                excerpting by the <hi rend="underline">Nation</hi>!<ptr target="loc.03299_n2"/> We
                tried to get the magazine through Brentano, but failed. It must make these fellows
                gnash their teeth to see this growing foreign appreciation.&#8212;Send the slip back
                some time when you are writing.</p>
            <p>I got a copy of Kennedy's pamphlet<ptr target="loc.03299_n3"/> from him, and but for
                my bad condition would have written to him, which I will do yet. I cant help
                feeling that he skates on pretty thin ice <pb xml:id="leaf002r"
                    facs="loc.03299.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>sometimes, though he says many
                things which are quite undeniable.</p>
            <p>I had a letter from Grace Channing<ptr target="loc.03299_n4"/> recently in which she
                says: "By the way, there is in the latest edition of Leaves of Grass a
                poem&#8212;'The City Dead-House'&#8212;which affects me I cannot tell you how
                powerfully. I never saw it before, and I think Walt has never written anything more
                divinely beautiful. Often as I have read it, I can't keep the tears out of my
                eyes."</p>
            <p>The Channings are all very happy in their new home at Pasadena in California. It
                appears to be a perfect Paradise</p>
            <p>Up to date, the New York publishers have uniformly refused<pb xml:id="leaf002v"
                    facs="loc.03299.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/> to publish my Baconian reply to R.
                G. White, even at my expense!<ptr target="loc.03299_n5"/> Reason, Shakespearean
                hostility to the subject. This is a pretty note! I am now going to try Boston.</p>
            <p>The death of Mrs. Gilchrist deeply stirred me.<ptr target="n0259"/> I was just about
                to try to write to her when I saw the news of her decease.</p>
            <p>When you next write, tell me how your eyes are. I am really anxious to know.
                </p>
