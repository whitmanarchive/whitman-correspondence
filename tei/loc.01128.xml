            <p>I am back only a few days from a 3 weeks trip to Canada.<ptr target="n0129"/> The morning after my return some wretch poisoned my dog &amp; the loss has quite <choice><orig>up set</orig><reg>upset</reg></choice> me. I have not been <choice><orig>my self</orig><reg>myself</reg></choice> since. Then I am out of sorts in body &amp; wife is away under the doctors care, so that I am not having a very good time. We traveled&#8212;Mr. Johns &amp; me&#8212;about 2300 miles, &amp; excepting a week spent in the woods

            north of Quebec, the trip was a good deal of a bore. We went by way of Boston &amp; I ran about there some, I called on <choice><sic>Gurnsey</sic><corr>Guernsey</corr></choice><ptr target="n0836"/> of the Boston Herald &amp; found him a very likable young man&#8212;in fact a thoroughly good fellow. He said he had written to you, but had rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi> no reply yet. I told him you were probably away in the country. I liked the looks of Boston much. We poked about Cambridge some &amp; then went over to Concord &amp; passed a night there. I found Mr Sanborn<ptr target="n0915"/> &amp; was cordially rec<hi rend="underline">d</hi>. I had seen him the day before in Boston. I like Sanborn all except his lofty coldness &amp; reserve. It seems to be the style out there to affect ignorance of every thing you are interested in

            He showed us the home &amp; some of the haunts of Thoreau, &amp; then his grave &amp; that of Hawthorne. He took me to see Alcott<ptr target="n0741"/> whom I liked. Alcott praised my Emerson piece, but Sanborn appeared not to know anything about my writings. We were at Alcotts only a few minutes. He spoke in a friendly way about you &amp;c. We passed <hi rend="underline">by</hi> Emersons house &amp; I admired his wood pile, I did not feel like calling upon him of my own motion. Alcott said he was well. I liked Concord, but I don't see how any great thing can come out of that place.</p> 
            <p>I got the Library Table with Blood's sanguinary review of my book.<ptr target="n0837"/> It is very petty criticism &amp; I think I can stand it better than Blood can. He evidently

            wanted to pitch into my Eagle, but was afraid of the claws. I hope I shall see you soon, as I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> go to W. this month unless the heat is too oppressive. Write me how &amp; where you are.</p>
