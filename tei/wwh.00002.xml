               <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have just finished a letter to mother, and while my hand is in, I will write you a line. I enclose in my letter to Mother, a note from Hyde<ptr target="wwh.00002_n1"/>&#8212;nothing at all in it, except that Han is well, and comfortably situated&#8212;I have not heard a word from home since I left&#8212;write me a few words, Jeff, if mother does not,<ptr target="wwh.00002_n2"/> and let me know how you all are, and whether you have took the house or given it up.<ptr target="wwh.00002_n3"/> I suppose of course if every thing was not going on pretty much as usual, some of you would have written to tell me.</p>
            <p>I am having a tolerable fair time here in Boston&#8212;not quite enough to occupy me&#8212;only two or three hours work a day, reading proof. Still, I am so satisfied at the certainty of having "Leaves of Grass," in a far more complete and favorable form than before, printed and really published, that I don't mind small things. The book will be a very handsome specimen of typography, paper, binding, &amp;c.&#8212;and will be, it seems to me, like relieving me of a great weight&#8212;or removing a great obstacle that has been in my way for the last three years. The young men that are publishing it treat me in a way I could not wish to have better. They are go-ahead fellows, and don't seem to have the least doubt they are bound to make a good spec. out of my book. It is quite curious, all this should spring up so suddenly, aint it.<ptr target="wwh.00002_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>I am very well, and hold my own about as usual. I am stopping at a lodging house, have a very nice room, gas, water, good American folks keep it&#8212;I pay $2&#8212;eat at restaurant. I get up in the morning, give myself a good wash all over, and currying&#8212;then take a walk, often in the Common&#8212;then nothing but a cup of coffee generally for my breakfast&#8212;then to the stereotype foundry. About 12 I take a walk, and at 2, a good dinner. Not much else, in the way of eating, except that meal.</p>
            <p>If I have any thing to communicate, dear brother, I shall write again.</p>
