            <p>We received your letter today and I feel as if you could not get me a room without a great deal of trouble I suppose as Congress is in session that every place is taken up. I was thinking perhaps I could stay the first night with Mrs O Conner as they have invited me to come, I could sleep with Jennie and the next day I will visit Masons and if they should seem clever and ask me to stay with them I will do so. anyway dont bother about it for we will get some place after I get there. the only reason I would like to stop one night with Mr O Conner is that

            I will get there in the evening and I have no doubt when I call on Masons they will insist on my staying with them</p>
            
            <p>Mother says she will not write this week. the draft came all right and when you write again send her some <choice><orig>envolopes</orig> <reg>envelopes</reg></choice> she is about as well as usual some days quite lame.</p>

<p>I cant say the day I will come but will write again it will be some time next week</p>
