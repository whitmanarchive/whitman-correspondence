      <p>Yours<ptr target="n0793"/> of June 26<ptr target="rlc.00012_n1"/> duly arrived some days
        since. </p>

      <p>1) I have sent a paper to Kr. Elster<ptr target="n0216"/> at Throudhjem, containing my
        last, (the College poem) &amp; a piece in about my sickness. I sent you a copy same paper. </p>

      <p>2) The letter you speak of, (March 20,) duly reached me. I have no doubt, dear friend, that
        all the letters, papers, sheets, &amp;c. during the last three years sent me by your loving
        kindness &amp; attention have every one reached me. (The post office here is among the best
        things of the New World&#8212;is sure, quick, cheap, &amp; every way admirable. If letters
        addressed to me go to other cities, as they sometimes do, they are pretty sure eventually to
        come <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#8212;the post office men, even the carriers, are
        wonderfully bright &amp; intuitive.) </p>

      <p>3) I will be on the look out for John Burroughs's photograph&#8212;he is well at last
        accounts. </p>

      <p>4) I myself have <hi rend="italic">pleased myself</hi> more fully with <hi rend="italic"
        >Redwood Tree</hi><ptr target="n0578"/> than any of my pieces of late years.<ptr target="rlc.00012_n2"/> But it
        is generally thought wild &amp; cloudy here&#8212;(the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> is
        more popular far)&#8212;I suppose it is hardly necessary to tell you that I have <hi
          rend="italic">pitched</hi> and <hi rend="italic">keyed</hi> my pieces more with reference
        to fifty years hence, &amp; how they will stand mellowed and toned <hi rend="italic"
          >then</hi>&#8212;than to pleasing &amp; tickling the immediate impressions of the present
        hour. </p>

      <p>6)<ptr target="rlc.00012_n3"/> I have not heard any thing more of C. Petersen
        lately&#8212;but if I meet with any thing of his printed, I will send you. </p>

      <p>7) All the criticisms, Danish papers, &amp; those from Norway, duly <choice>
          <orig>rec'd</orig>
          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice>&#8212;to be carefully translated &amp; read to me&#8212;<hi rend="italic">I prize
          them all, very much</hi>&#8212;but I am yet feeble, &amp; read, write &amp;c. as little as
        possible. 8) One or two little items have been in the papers here about the <hi
          rend="italic">Fremblik</hi> translation. I get along with your English very well
        indeed&#8212;</p>

        <p>Rudolf Schmidt <lb/>My dear friend,</p>

        <p>Your letter of July 28, from Ga&#251;sdal,<ptr target="rlc.00012_n4"/> in "old Norway"
          reached me <choice>
            <orig>to-day</orig>
            <reg>today</reg>
          </choice>. Quite curiously, on the very same day, I was writing to you&#8212;as per sheet
          accompanying, written at date (a month ago) but not sent until I could add further. I am
          glad to get your letter from Norway&#8212;am still laid up sick &amp; lonesome
          here&#8212;do not seem to get any thing like well, &amp; at times the prospect is very
          uncertain&#8212;yet maintain a steady heart. I was dismissed from my clerkship under
          Government at Washington about two months ago. I write this by my open window&#8212;the
          majestic &amp; beautiful Delaware flows near, in sight&#8212;we have had a fine summer in
          America&#8212;&amp; now a spell of rich, golden, mellow weather&#8212;far &amp; near
          wonderful crops of every thing&#8212;now beginning to be gathered. </p>
