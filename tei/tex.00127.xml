         <p>I<ptr target="tex.00127_n100"/> again take my pen in hand to write a few lines to you to let you know how I am a getting  This makes the second Letter that I have wrote to you but as I expect the other one did not reach you I will try, try again, or maybe you have bin sick or have not had time to write, but I hope that you are not sick for you could not have as good attendance thear as if you wer at home and I do not know what the boys about the Hospital would do for they would miss you verry much.</p>
            <p>I got a letter from Tom. Sawyer<ptr target="tex.00127_n2"/> on Saturday he is well and sens his love to you. he has bin in that Gettysburg Battle. he sais that it was awful, and that he never wants to see the like of it again</p>
            <p>My health is verry good, and my leg dos still continue's to mend slowly&#8212;but verry slow, the Doctor has took out three little pieces of bone out of it since I came home.</p>
            <p>I am enjoying my self as well as I can with my <hi rend="italic">four legs</hi> but I cannot go about much yet I am a going out a carriage riding tomorrow if it dos not rain I do not know how I will stand it for it hurt me more riding from the Depot home than it did all the way in the cars.</p>
            <p>I will be back to the hospital about the last of August. I would like to be thear in time to see the boys present Doctor Bliss<ptr target="tex.00127_n3"/> with that Case of instruments on the 23 of August, that will be my anaversary it will be just a year since I came to that hospital on that day so I think I will have to hurry back to see it. The farmers have got pretty near don Harvisting and the crops are pretty good without  it is grass and it is light and thear was so mutch wet weather that some of that was spoilt. No more at present but good by and write soon with my love to you and all enquiring friends, I remain your sincear friend Lewis K. Brown. Direct your letter to Lewis K. Brown Elkton, Cecil Country, (Md). paper is scarce so I will have to close good by and God bless you.</p>
