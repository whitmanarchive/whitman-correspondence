                <salute>Dear friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Yours of 12th recd. I sent Dowden's letter soon after getting it, to O'Connor, with
                written request on it to send to Dr Bucke, with similar request to him to send to
                you&#8212;I supposed you had it a fortnight or more ago.<ptr target="pri.00036_n3"/> I yesterday wrote to
                O'Connor about it asking him to forward to you directly. The same round (to
                O'C&#8212;to Dr. B and to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>) to a long notice of
                "Specimen Days" in the "Academy" by Dowden<ptr target="pri.00036_n4"/>&#8212;I supposed you had rec'd
                both&#8212;I fancy you certainly will get them&#8212;perhaps you have
                already&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have those Emerson vols (just as you lent them to me over 10 years ago) boxed up
                &#38; stored with other traps in Washington at the house
                of old Mr Nash, Peter Doyle's uncle&#8212;Shall surely have the boxes here before
                long, (or go on &#38; overhaul them) &#38; if that will do&#8212;will certainly see the
                vols are sent to you&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am quite over my bad spell of a month ago&#8212;havn't made any move from Camden yet, but shall&#8212;"Specimen Days" moves pretty
                sluggishly&#8212;no great demand&#8212;L of G. better, but by no means what was
                anticipated&#8212;</p>
            <p>I am more than satisfied, however&#8212;every thing might have been so much
                worse&#8212;&#38; best of all, in my mind, on looking over L of G. as it now
                stands&#8212;I don't worry about how much better it ought to be, but thankful it is
                as well as it is&#8212;I am content to let it rest, to let it go as it is, without the least wish to meddle with it any more, (a
                feeling I havn't had before, but now certainly
                settled.)</p>
            <p>I have a criticism on Burns in to-morrows 'Critic'<ptr target="pri.00036_n5"/>&#8212;Love to 'Sula and the dear
                little fellow&#8212;(I bear you all more in mind than you think for)&#8212;I hear
                there is a notice of L of G. in Dec. "Nineteenth Century"<ptr target="pri.00036_n6"/>&#8212;</p>
