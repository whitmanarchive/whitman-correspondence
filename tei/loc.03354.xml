                <salute>My dear Friend and Guide.</salute>       
            </opener>
            
            <p>Today I have had a note from Ruskin.<ptr target="n3013"/> This is a copy:&#8212;</p>
            <p>'London 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> April</p>
            <p>Dear Riley</p>
            <p>Your letter was sent on here. I am very glad to know that I can give some pleasure to such a man. I will write to him directly. Send the book to Brantwood' [His residence in the 'lake district'] 'All you tell me is more frightful than I care to write of.</p>
            <p>Ever very Gratefully Yrs</p>
            <p>J. Ruskin'</p>                
            
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.03354.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>You will require a little explanation respecting some parts of the note. When I wrote and told him the book had come, I also told him that you had been dismissed from office in Washington, and that the American publishers will not publish your works. This intense stupidity of the publishers is, I think, the 'frightful' fact of all. <hi rend="underline">I</hi> was amazed when I read of the fact. The 'pleasure'
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03354.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                    I think is the greeting he can give you. He is the most eminent judge of <hi rend="underline">Scripture</hi> and painting in Europe, and his stamp upon any work is regarded as being as infallible as the 'Goldsmith's Hall' stamp on British gold ware.<ptr target="n3014"/></p>
                
                <p>He has no 'publisher,' though he could choose among the whole lot in England. His works are published by an old servant, and the price of his books is
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03354.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                the same to a 'retail' as to a 'wholesale' buyer&#8212;I mean that there is no discount.</p>
                
                <p>(I am writing very hastily, as I must go out and dig again as soon as possible, as the weather is favourable, and the 'season' is late.)</p>
                
                <p>I can do little, but something <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be done, whilst you are living, to increase the knowledge of your works.</p>
                
                <p>Soon <hi rend="underline">I</hi> also must have some photographs, and I think there is no one who
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf003r" facs="loc.03354.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
                so nearly worships you as I do, and nobody who would more willingly stick by you as long as we live.</p>
                
                <p>The papers I should have sent, were <hi rend="underline">not</hi> sent. Perhaps they will be sent to-day. (They are merely to show you the sort of writings I have penned.)</p>
                
                <p>I hope you will be as glad as I am that Ruskin can see, and <hi rend="underline">has</hi> seen your meaning.

            He is a stern critic, and as honest as God&#8212;or a tree.</p>
            
            <p>Loving you for your human nature, and reverencing your divine nature.</p>
