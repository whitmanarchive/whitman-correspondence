                <salute>Dear Mr. Whitman,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I was exceedingly pleased at receiving your recent letter, &amp; the photograph <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> followed it immediately afterwards. I admire the photograph very much; rather grudge its having the hat on &amp; so cutting one out of the full portraiture of your face, but have little doubt, allowing for this detail, it brings me very near your external aspect. May I be allowed to send you, as a very meagre requital, the enclosed likeness of myself.</p>

            <p>I gave your letter, &amp; the second copy of your portrait, to the lady you refer to, &amp; need scarcely say how truly delighted she was. She has asked me to say that you 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01880.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                <choice><abbr>cd.</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> not have devised for her a more welcome pleasure, &amp; that she feels grateful to me for having sent to America the extracts from what she had written, since they have been a satisfaction to you. She also begs leave, with much deference, to offer a practical suggestion:—that if you see no reason against it, the new edition might be issued in 2 vols., lettered, not vols. 1 &amp; 2, but 1st series &amp; 2nd series, so that they <choice><abbr>cd.</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> be priced &amp; sold separated when so desired. She adds: "This simple expedient <choice><abbr>wd.</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice>, I think, overcome a serious difficulty. Those who are not able to receive aright all Mr. Whitman has written might, to their own infinite gain, have what they <hi rend="underline">can</hi> receive, &amp; grow by means of that food to be capable of the whole perhaps; while he <choice><abbr>wd.</abbr><expan>would</expan></choice> stand as unflinchingly as hitherto by what he has written. I know I am glad that your selections were put into my hands first, so that I was lifted up by them to stand firm on higher ground than I had ever stood on before, &amp; furnished with a golden key before approaching the rest of the poems." She also, 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01880.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
                
as a hearty admirer of your original Preface, hopes that that may re-appear—either whole, or such portions as have not since been used in other forms.</p>

            <p>I know, by a letter from O'Connor, that, since you wrote, you have seen the further observations of this lady <choice><abbr>wh.</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> I sent over in Nov.—I replied to O'Connor the other day also, still more recently, took the liberty of posting to you a little essay of mine, written for one of our literary societies, on "Italian Courtesy books" of the Middle Ages. Some of the extracts I have translated in it may, I hope, be found not without their charm &amp; value. I wrote to Conway giving him your cordial message: probably you know that he was not long ago in Russia. Also I heard the other day from a man I am much attached to, Stillman, of his having re-encountered you in Washington. As he told you, there is a chance—not as yet <hi rend="underline">more</hi> than a chance—that I may make my way over the Atlantic for a brief glimpse of America in the summer. If so, how great a delight it will be to me to see &amp; know 
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01880.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
you need not, I hope, be stated in words.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps before that I shall have received here the new edition you refer to—another deep draught of satisfaction.</p>
            
            <p>I <choice><abbr>cd</abbr><expan>could</expan></choice> run on a great deal further on these &amp; other topics; but <choice><abbr>shd</abbr><expan>should</expan></choice> have to come to a close at last somewhere, &amp; may perhaps as well do so now.</p>
