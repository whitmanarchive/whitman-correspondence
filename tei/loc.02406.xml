                people sometimes use expressions (words or phrases) without a conscious copying
                after others who have used the same. Of course it can't be avoided that we shall use (with

                I am moved to say
                these things by remembering how I have sometimes in writing to you made use of just such phrases as
                are in your books&#8212;when I was not a bit conscious of copying. Notably, I wrote
                you a two-page letter (with scrap <hi rend="underline">codicil</hi>) on August 14
                1875, giving you the "<hi rend="underline">theory of my life</hi>". Well, for

            <p>I suppose the Radical Review is discontinued&#8212;I had thought of suggesting to

                <hi rend="underline">obstacle</hi> was that the book (1871) was such a big

                so pleases me that I can never again be the same man in measured happiness or

            <p>In Democratic Vistas you make too much of sick, wounded men not complaining. I accept
                howling, crying, cursing at distress the same as shouting for joy. What if a <hi rend="underline"
