            <p>I received your letter and was right glad to get it<ptr target="owu.00003_n1"/> I am in rather a writing mood
                today and have written a long letter to Han<ptr target="owu.00003_n2"/> I also enclosed one from Jeff it was a
                very long and lively one and I thought it would please her. I am having very
                pleasant times here, sometimes, it is very gay, it it the style here when any one
                has company every one calls on them. tomorrow I have to return quite a number it is
                quite a bore to me to make fashionable calls but of course I must submit to it. but
                what I enjoy most of any thing else is sitting in my window looking down the <choice>
                    <orig>Susquanhanna</orig>
                    <reg>Susquehanna</reg>
                </choice> for miles and on the opposite side long ranges of the <choice>
                    <orig>Alleganny</orig>
                    <reg>Allegheny</reg>
                </choice> Mountains they are mostly cultivated and their is something delightful
                about the scenery I would never tire looking at it we have not had what I call a
                real hot day <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="owu.00003.002.jpg" type="verso"/> this
                summer the children are very happy and contented seldom talk about home they are
                very fat and burnt Hattie talks a good deal about seeing you, and says she is going
                out with Uncle Walt. I write to Mother quite often it seems to cheer her up to get
                letters, I tell her every little particular I have been to a number of picnics they are very pleasant. this week we expect to go to the
                Barclay coal mines<ptr target="owu.00003_n3"/> every one around here seems related some way to Mr or Mrs Mason
                we also go riding a good deal the time passes quickly and I am much pleased that I
                decided to come here I expect to leave for Washington with Mary &amp; Jule the 29th
                ins't Wont you come and
                <!-- appears to be missing a word here, perhaps "see" LL, 12/15/2010 --> me Walt
                before you leave for Brooklyn<ptr target="owu.00003_n4"/> I want to see you very much about those "Notes"<ptr target="owu.00003_n5"/> I would
                like much to have a copy but think it hardly worth while to send them here but you
                will save me a copy when I come to Washington I dont think of any more to write at
                present and it is getting late and I want yet to write one to Mother bidding you
                good night I remain your Affectionate sister</p>
