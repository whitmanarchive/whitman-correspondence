            <p>I got a letter from Jeff yesterday&#8212;he says you often work too hard, exposing yourself, I suppose scrubbing &amp;c. and the worst of it is I am afraid it is true&#8212;Mother, I would take things easy, &amp; let up on the scrubbing &amp; such things, they may be needed perhaps, but they ain't half as much needed as that you should be as well as possible, &amp; free from rheumatism &amp; cold<ptr target="loc.00816_n1"/>&#8212;Jeff says that sis has had the chicken pox&#8212;has she got all over it&#8212;I want to hear&#8212;So Nance<ptr target="loc.00816_n2"/> has had another child, poor little one, there don't seem to be much show for it, poor little young one, these times.</p>
            <p>We are having awful rainy weather here&#8212;it is raining to-day, steady &amp; spiteful enough&#8212;the soldiers in camp are having the benefit of it, &amp; the sick, many of them&#8212;there is a great deal of rheumatism &amp; also throat diseases, &amp; they are affected by the weather&#8212;I have writ to George again, directed to Knoxville&#8212;Mother, I got a letter this morning from Lewis Brown,<ptr target="loc.00816_n3"/> the young man that had his leg amputated two months or so ago&#8212;(the one that I slept in the hospital by several nights for fear of hemorrhage from the amputation)&#8212;he is home at Elkton, Maryland, on furlough, he wants me to come out there, but I believe I shall not go, he is doing very well&#8212;there are many very bad now in hospitals&#8212;so many of the soldiers are getting broke down after two years, or two &amp; a half, exposure, &amp; bad diet, pork, hard biscuit, bad water or none at all, &amp;c &amp;c&#8212;so we have them brought up here. O it is terrible, &amp; getting worse, worse, worse&#8212;I thought it was bad to see the wounded, but to see these I sometimes think is more pitiful still&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, I went to see the great spirit medium Foster, there were some little things some might call curious perhaps, but it is a shallow thing &amp; a humbug&#8212;a gentleman who was with me was somewhat impressed, but I could not see any thing in it worth calling supernatural&#8212;I wouldnt turn on my heel to go again &amp; see such things, or twice as much&#8212;we had table rappings &amp; lots of nonsense&#8212;I will give you particulars when I come home one of these days&#8212;</p>
            <p>Jeff, I believe there is a fate on your long letter, I thought I would write it to-day, but as it happens I will hardly get this in the mail I fear in time for to-day&#8212;O how I want to see you all, &amp; sis &amp; Hat&#8212;Well I have scratched out a great letter, just as fast as I could write&#8212;</p>
            <p>Wednesday forenoon&#8212;Mother, I didn't get the letter in the mail yesterday&#8212;I have just had my breakfast, some good tea &amp; good toast &amp; butter&#8212;I write this in my room, 456 Sixth st.&#8212;the storm seems to be over&#8212;dear Mother, I hope you are well &amp; in good spirits&#8212;Write to me often as you can &amp; Jeff too&#8212;any news from Han?</p>
