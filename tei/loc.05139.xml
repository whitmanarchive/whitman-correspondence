            <p>I suppose it must look fine down there after the heavy rain last night&#8212;we had
                it here nearly all night, pouring &amp; thundering&#8212;along the Hudson in New
                York it was a furious hailstorm, destroyed all the growing fruit &amp;
                grain&#8212;</p>

            <p>Nothing very new with me&#8212;the big Boston house has sent me word that they will
                publish my book for me&#8212;&amp; I have sent them back word that I must have a
                bigger percentage than they offer&#8212;So that's the way it stands now&#8212;I find
                I can have them publish it, if I choose, but I suppose I am getting pretty lofty in
                my old days &amp; must have my own terms, &amp; pretty good ones too&#8212;</p>

            <p>I am feeling pretty well&#8212;I think my last visit down there did me good, real
                good after all&#8212;it has been very hot &amp; unpleasant ever since I came up, <choice>

                sufficiently cool&#8212;</p>

            <p>I am alone in the house, have been all day&#8212;My sister went out with a number of
                lady friends to spend the day in Fairmount Park, &amp; have dinner there, &amp; a sort
                of <hi rend="italic">woman spree</hi> among themselves&#8212;I got my dinner
                myself&#8212;cooked it by the gas stove, &amp; eat it in <hi rend="italic"
                    >delightful company</hi>, viz: myself!</p>

            <p>I have got a long letter from Edward Carpenter, he has quite a good deal to say of
                the death of his mother&#8212;she was quite worn out, died three or four months
                ago&#8212;he is living with a friend, a farmer &amp; his wife&#8212;his address is
                    <hi rend="italic">Bradway, near Sheffield, England</hi>&#8212;</p>

            <p>There has been the most terrible accident up at <choice>

                </choice> folks however&#8212;Well I suppose you are in the agonies of the church
                festival&#8212;how did Wm Heiniken's affair turn out?&#8212;I hope Theodore is
                most well by this time&#8212;I may go on to New York for a short visit&#8212;if not
                I shall come down soon, for two or three days&#8212;will send you
                word&#8212;</p>
