            <p>I have just received your letter, &amp; respond immediately, because by what you have written, it may be that you can do me a great favor&#8212;I have obtained leave of absence, &amp; am coming to New York, principally to bring out a new &amp; much better edition of Leaves of Grass complete&#8212;that <hi rend="italic">unkillable</hi> work!&#8212;Mother's apartments in Pacific st are very limited, &amp; I had decided to get a lodging room in N. Y. or Brooklyn, so as not to incommode my folks at home&#8212;taking my meals at the restaurants, &amp; home &amp;c&#8212;leaving my time free for my work &amp;c&#8212;Now <hi rend="italic">have you such a room for me</hi>, at a fair price? I hope you have, for that would be very agreeable&#8212;Your going off for a week or two would not make any difference&#8212;as a lodging is my main object&#8212;write <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> &amp; let me know, as my leave of absence will probably date from Monday next, 6th inst&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mrs. O'Connor<ptr target="pml.00015_n3"/> has gone west, with her mother, for the summer&#8212;Wm O'Connor<ptr target="pml.00015_n4"/> is well&#8212;We all speak of you&#8212;The weather is almost perfect here now-a-days&#8212;I am writing this by my window in the south front of the Treasury building, looking down the beautiful grounds in front, and across &amp; down the Potomac for miles, &amp; across to the green hills all along Arlington Heights, very beautiful &amp; cool&#8212;a view of great expanse, &amp; very comforting every way&#8212;also a pleasant breeze coming in steadily from the river.</p>
            <p>I have an agreeable situation here&#8212;labor moderate&#8212;&amp; plenty of leisure&#8212;My principal work is to make (from rough drafts) the letters, answers, law opinions, &amp;c that go from the Attorney General to the President, or to the Secretary of State, &amp; the other Heads of Departments&#8212;The rule is that none but such officers as just named have a right to require information from Attorney Generals&#8212;So you see I have to do only with the big men&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is one regular Soldiers Hospital left here, in K street&#8212;I go there once or twice every week&#8212;it is still a great privilege to go&#8212;You would be amazed, as well as distressed, to know how many old wounds are lingering along yet&#8212;youth &amp; hope struggling against fate&#8212;but the latter, alas! almost always conquering at last&#8212;it is indeed a great privilege to soothe the lingering days &amp; months of many of these cases.</p>
