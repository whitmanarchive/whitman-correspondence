            </opener>
         <p>I<ptr target="loc.00874_n100"/> have been thinking much of you lately &amp; wondering where you were (for I heard some time since that you had left Washington), when the N.Y. Times came, with your long &amp; interesting communication.  I do not yet, from reading that, understand very well where you are, &amp; I send this at a venture.  If this reaches you, please let me 
               
               <pb facs="loc_vm.00658.jpg" type="verso"/>
               
               know your address, &amp; I will try to send you something to help along your good work.  I sent you, some time last summer, by private hands, a copy of "Great Expectations" &amp; two dollars in money, but could never learn that they reached you:  did they?  How are you now?</p>
            <p>A great change has taken place in my life since I saw you.  My dearest friend has left me, leaving in her place a little boy, now

               eleven months old.&#8212;A superb little fellow (although I say it); &amp; in him I have great comfort.</p>
            <p>I went three times to find Dr. <choice>

               <corr>LeBaron</corr>
            </choice> Russell, with your note in my hand, but failing each time, I gave him up<ptr target="loc.00874_n2"/>.</p>
            <p>I am not trying to withdraw from the arena of popular literature; only the necessity of coining a livelihood has kept me in it so long.  I feel that, if I live frugally ' sincerely, and do not use up my

               mental energies in rapid writing I may be able to do something excellent.  I am about getting out a volume of poems,&#8212;or, as you would say, prettinesses.</p>
