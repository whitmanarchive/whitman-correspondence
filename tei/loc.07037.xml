            <p>The "After All" parcel<ptr target="loc.07037_n1"/> came to hand last evening to my
                great relief for I had almost given it up and had written to Washington about it. I
                see it was returned to you for more stamps. Thank you very much for the new (1886)
                    portrait,<ptr target="loc.07037_n2"/> I like it very much &#38; thanks too for
                the facsimile letter with English list of contributors.<ptr target="loc.07037_n3"/>
                I have the Centenial ed. both of L of G. &#38; 2 Riv. (sent on last order) but
                nothing further so far. You know I asked you also for L. of G. author's Ed.
                1882&#8212;also current Ed. of L. of G. &#38; specimen days, also for any thing you might have and be willing to part with earlier than 1870&#8212;</p>
<p>            By the way I want, both '71 and '72 L of G. but I do not think you have them. I have sent
               to McKay<ptr target="n4983"/> for some portraits for Harry Forman<ptr target="loc.07037_n4"/> and myself
                and have told McKay when he has them collected to send them over to you to be signed
                and dated. I hope you will kindly do this for me. Is the new portrait for "Autumn
                Boughs"? and are you thinking of bringing that book out soon.<ptr
                    target="loc.07037_n5"/> I hope so. Do not forget that you are to be ready to
                move in <hi rend="underline">May</hi> bag &#38; baggage &#38; make your calculations
                accordingly. Mercury fell to zero here this morning, a lovely bright
                morning&#8212;good sleighing here now. Remember me very kindly to Mrs Stafford &#38;
                all the family when you see them&#8212;Has Harry had his neck attended to yet?<ptr
                    target="loc.07037_n6"/></p>
            <p>Please send on the book as soon as convenient.</p>
