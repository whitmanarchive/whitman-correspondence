            </choice> Dr Bucke's book. I know something about it, &#38; do not
                object. Dr B. has spent considerable on the illustrations (I have seen them, they
                are quite creditable) has gathered a variety of biographical
                information&#8212;criticises my poems from an almost passionately friendly point of
                view (as scientist, student of poetry, medical doctor &#38;c)&#8212;&#38; has
                included what as time goes on may prove a curiously valuable collection of
                cumulative opinions on L of G. from 1856 to the present day&#8212;&#38; I should say
                it would be a safe publication-enterprise&#8212;but you must of course judge &#38;
                decide for yourselves<ptr target="upa.00203_n1"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Another thing I must broach&#8212;hoping you are not alarmed at the District Attorney
                episode, (as I am not at all,) but see your way clear to continue on in
                earnest&#8212;</p> 
            <p>I have about got into shape a volume (<hi rend="italic">It</hi> at least will not be

            </choice> flurry blowing over, &#38;
                we getting things into good shape&#8212;(as of course I suppose <hi rend="italic">it</hi> surely will,
                &#38; <hi rend="italic">we</hi> will)&#8212;would you bring it out say late this summer, same terms as L of
                G? In that case there would be three Volumes gyrating together, the L of G&#8212;the
                S D &#38; T&#8212;and Dr Bucke's book&#8212;</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, &#38; as my friend seems determined to bring out his book, I hope you
                will take it. I know Dr Bucke well, &#38; have for some years&#8212;He is a
                perfectly honorable, reliable solid man to deal with&#8212;a linguist, well
                conversant with the best German, French &#38; British poetry&#8212;of English stock
                &#38; birth, but grown up in Canada and the California regions of America, &#38;
                combining in my opinion the best traits of both nationalities. He is now &#38; has
                been for some years, (in fact he built up &#38; organized it) at the head of the
                largest &#38; most complete &#38; modernized Asylum for the Insane in
                America&#8212;(one of the largest in the world&#8212;1000 persons under his
                charge)&#8212;near London, Ontario, Canada&#8212;Though enthusiastic he has a
                careful eye to practical &#38; business responsibilities&#8212;has a fine very large
                family of children&#8212;his social, professional, citizen &#38;c reputation, all
                first class in Canada.</p>
