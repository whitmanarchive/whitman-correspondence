<salute>(&amp; Dear friends all)</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>The letter of the 28th reached me yesterday after going wrong and was truly welcome. 
        (I suppose you <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> my postal card<ptr target="pml.00042_n2"/> acknowledging your previous one, briefly, &amp; saying I should prefer the upper room.) 
        Since then I have had another bad spell&#8212;has lasted some fifteen days&#8212;head, legs, 
        gastric region, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> bad&#8212;but am to-day feeling decidedly better. I shall <hi rend="italic">quite 
        certainly</hi> come on&#8212;cannot now [pla]n the time, but will write before&#8212;&amp; take up my quarters a while with you, as it seems to be agreeable, &amp; the moderate sum 
        you mention I should pay thankfully&#8212;Though badly disabled, I am perfectly able 
        to take care of myself, &amp; my sister says I am no trouble&#8212;I am sure we would all get along well together&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I have just <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> a letter from Mrs. O'Connor, from Washington, today. Her daughter, 
        (just 16,) is not well, has had a form of measles, a second attack, quite severe, 
        &amp; is otherwise ailing, but I think will probably come out of it all, &amp; grow stronger. 
        I was glad to hear about your dear grandchildren&#8212;and about our friends 
        Mrs. Davis<ptr target="pml.00042_n3"/> &amp; Mrs. Rein<ptr target="pml.00042_n4"/>&#8212;I am alone, in the house to-day, (except Eddy)&#8212;as my sister has gone out 
        to spend the day, &amp; my brother has gone to Easton, about his work. My brother Jeff, 
        at St. Louis, is well&#8212;his girls are growing finely.
      </p>
      
      <p>I am sitting here in the parlor&#8212;it is about 11½&#8212;the sun has just come out, after a cloudy 
        half-rainy morning&#8212;is mild &amp; warm&#8212;I go out for about an hour generally about noon, 
        with my cane, (&amp; accompanied by my little yellow &amp; white dog, a most faithful affectionate 
        companion)&#8212;frequently take a ride in the cars, or across in the boat&#8212;the men quite all know me, &amp; are very kind.
