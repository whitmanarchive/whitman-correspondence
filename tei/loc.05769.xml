                <salute> Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I don't suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it gives
                    me. But Villiers Stanford<ptr target="loc.05769_n1"/> is, I
                think, the best composer England has produced since the days of Purcell &amp; Blow,
                and your words will be sent home to hundreds &amp; thousands who had not before seen
                them. How lovely the words read as themes for great music! </p>
            <p> I have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy&#8212;it
                stands all alone on the top of a heath-clad hill, with miles of coppice (young
                woods) below it, and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more wooded hills
                jutting out into it&#8212;and you see the storms a long way off travelling up from
                the sea, and you can wander for miles &amp; miles through the woods or over the
                breezy hill&#8212;or, as you sit at your window, feel yourself in the very heart of
                a great, beautiful solitude. Very kind, warm friends, too, they are, who leave you
                as free as a bird to do what you like. I have had all the papers, dear friend, &amp;
                have enjoyed them. </p>
            <p> Now I am in the heart of the "Black Country," as we call it&#8212;black with the
                smoke of thousands of foundries &amp; works of all kinds&#8212;staying with Percy
                &amp; his wife. Percy<ptr target="n2000"/> is having a very arduous time here
                starting some Steel Works&#8212;&amp; what with his men being inexperienced &amp;
                times bad &amp; the machinery not yet perfectly adjusted, he seems harassed night
                &amp; day&#8212;for these things have to be kept going all night too&#8212;but I
                hope he will get into smoother waters soon. The little son is rosy &amp; bright
                &amp; healthy&#8212;goes to school now, which, being an only child, he enjoys
                mightily for the sake of the companionship of other boys. </p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Love from us all, dear friend.</salute>

                <p> Grace<ptr target="n0890"/> &amp; Herby<ptr target="n0262"/> well &amp; busy when
                    I left. </p>
