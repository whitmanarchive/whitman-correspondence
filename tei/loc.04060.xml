            </opener>

            <p>I have had joyful news to-day! Percy's wife has a fine little boy&#8212;it was born on the 10th, and Norah got through well &#38; is doing nicely; so I feel very happy.</p>
            
            <p>Since then Per. has gone to Paris where he is to read a paper before the "Iron and Steel Institute" on the Elimination of phosphorus from Iron&#8212;which is also a little triumph of another kind for him&#8212;for the Council which accepted his paper is composed of eminent English scientists, &#38; eminent foreign ones will hear it.&#8212;I need not tell you it is indescribably lovely here now&#8212;no doubt Kirkwood is the same&#8212;the light so brilliant, and yet soft&#8212;the rich autumn tints just beginning to appear&#8212;the temperature delicious&#8212;crisp &#38; bracing, yet genial.</p>
            
            <p>The throng of people is gone&#8212;but a few of the pleasantest of the old set remain&#8212;&#38; a few interesting new ones have come!&#8212;among them Mrs. Dexter from Boston, who was a Miss Tic[k]nor, daughter of the author of the book on Spanish literature&#8212;she and her husband full of interesting talk. Also Mr. Martin B&#8212;and his wife&#8212;a fine specimen of a leading Bostonian. Besides these also a physician from Florida whom I much admire&#8212;with a beautiful firm tenor voice&#8212;very handsome &#38; graceful too, a true southerner, I should say&#8212;(but of Scotch extraction).</p>

            <p>Next week we go to Boston.</p>
                
            <p>I went over the Lunatic Asylum here the other day &#38; saw some strange, sad sights&#8212;some figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection I shall never forget them&#8212;some very bright and talkative. It is said to be the best managed in America. Dr. Earle, who is at the head, is a man of splendid capacity for the post&#8212;a noble-looking old man (uncle of those Miss Chases you met at our house).</p>
            
            <p>I can't settle to anything or think of any thing since I received Percy's letter but the baby &#38; Norah. Love to you &#38; to Mrs. Whitman<!--<ptr target="loc.04060_n1"/>--> &#38; Hattie<!--<ptr target="loc.04061_n2"/>--> &#38; Jessie.<!--<ptr target="loc.04061_n3"/>--></p>
