            <p>Dr Bucke says you talk of going home with him: if you do be sure you stop &amp; see me
                on the way. We have a girl now &amp; are well fixed for the winter. Why not come on
                &amp; stay here till Dr Bucke is ready to go back? I was in <choice>

                a couple of weeks ago,
                &amp; saw Arnold at

            Gilder's house&#8212;liked him better than I expected, looks coarse &amp; strong &amp;
                healthy, has a sort of husky voice like a sea captain, looked as if he came from a
                bigger stronger race than the other persons in the room, no pride, or "manners" or
                "culture" visible in him. I found he knew of me &amp; was very cordial in meeting
                me. Liked him much better than the other Englishmen I have seen. Wish you could see
                him &amp; have a good sit down talk with him, I think he is honest &amp; sincere, &amp;
                not too sure about things in this country.

            The idea of his lecture on numbers, namely, that the majority is unsound, is to be taken with
                many qualifications &amp; I wish some one would answer it in a mild friendly way. From some
                points of view the majority may appear in the wrong, but from other very important
                ones they are in the right, especially modern majorities. The mass of men are
                no longer capable of being gulled &amp; duped and victimized as they were once. A shrewd
                common sense, that extends to big things as well as to little is characteristic of
                the people in this age. If the masses were essentially unsound

            the prophet &amp; the wise man would have only a barren soil to work on. I wish you
                would feel moved to write a short essay in The Critic on the subject. I enjoyed much
                your paper in this weeks number. I think that both Arnold &amp; Carlyle
                detach &amp; see out of its due relations, this idea of the unsoundness of the
                masses. I have written a short sketch as the result of my sea-shore sojourn, for the
                Boston "Wheelman" a new magazine of outdoor literature. I will send you the proof
                for suggestions &amp; revision, especially the part that relates to you</p>

                honestly with me. I have asked to see their accounts, &amp; they are willing, but
                probably I shall not go on these. When one of my books was published they sold the
                first 6 months 733 copies. When the next book came out, they sold in the same time
                733 copies. Of another <choice>
