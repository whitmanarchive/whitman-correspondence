               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I sent Jeff a letter three or four days ago, which I suppose he received. There is nothing very new with me&#8212;I see in the U. S. Senate yesterday they passed a resolution that it was the sense of the Senate that there ought to be an exchange of prisoners. I feel as if there was a fair chance of the box you sent getting to George&#8212;I wrote to Jeff how I was so much surer that a box from City Point, would go through, that I had sent a letter to Julius Mason<ptr target="loc.00839_n1"/> asking him to have a box made up there, &amp; sent, giving him the address, &amp; I or Jeff would pay the bill&#8212;if he writes to me that he has done so, I asked him to write if he got mine, I will send him the money myself&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well, mother, how are you getting along&#8212;we had a cold week, but the past three days has been much moderated&#8212;I am satisfied in the main with my room. I have such a good bed&#8212;&amp; my stove does very well&#8212;it is a little bit out of the way in location&#8212;My work as clerk in the Indian office is quite easy&#8212;I am through by 4&#8212;I find plenty who know me&#8212;I received a week's pay on Monday, came very acceptable&#8212;My appetite is not very good, but I feel very well upon the whole&#8212;I wish you would ask Wm Fosdick<ptr target="loc.00839_n2"/> in the corner house for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, &amp; also sketch of 51st I lent him, &amp; put them away&#8212;I am very glad I have employment (&amp; <hi rend="italic">pay</hi>)&#8212;I must try to keep it&#8212;I send you an envelope, so that you can write me a letter soon as convenient. I send $1 for Nancy, the other for you&#8212;I may not write again till about the 12th, or perhaps 10th&#8212;</p>
            <p>Tell Hattie &amp; sis Uncle Walt sent them his love. I see Gen. Butler<ptr target="loc.00839_n3"/> says the fault of not exchanging the prisoners is not his but Grants.</p>
