               <salute>Dear friend</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Your welcome letter of December 30 came safe. I have written &amp; sent my application to Mr Otto,<ptr target="nyp.00196_n2"/> &amp; also a few lines to Mr Ashton, with a copy of it.<ptr target="nyp.00196_n3"/> I am most desirous to get the appointment, as enclosing, with the rest of the points, my attentions to the soldiers &amp; to my poems, as you intimate.</p>
            <p>It may be Drum-Taps may come out this winter, yet, (in the way I have mentioned in times past.) It is in a state to put right through, a perfect copy being ready for the printers&#8212;I feel at last, &amp; for the first time without any demur, that I am satisfied with it&#8212;content to have it go to the world verbatim &amp; punctuation. It is in my opinion superior to Leaves of Grass&#8212;certainly more perfect as a work of art, being adjusted in all its proportions, &amp; its passion having the indispensable merit that though to the ordinary reader let loose with wildest abandon, the true artist can see it is yet under control. But I am perhaps mainly satisfied with Drum-Taps because it delivers my ambition of the task that has haunted me, namely, to express in a poem (&amp; in the way I like, which is not at all by directly stating it) the pending action of this <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Land we swim in</hi>, with all their large conflicting fluctuations of despair &amp; hope, the shiftings, masses, &amp; the whirl &amp; deafening din, (yet over all, as by invisible hand, a definite purport &amp; idea)&#8212;with the unprecedented anguish of wounded &amp; suffering, the beautiful young men, in wholesale death &amp; agony, everything sometimes as if in blood color, &amp; dripping blood. The book is therefore unprecedently sad, (as these days are, are they not?)&#8212;but it also has the blast of the trumpet, &amp; the drum pounds &amp; whirrs in it, &amp; then an undertone of sweetest comradeship &amp; human love, threading its steady thread inside the chaos, &amp; heard at every lull &amp; interstice thereof&#8212;truly also it has clear notes of faith &amp; triumph.</p>
            <p>Drum Taps has none of the perturbations of Leaves of Grass. I am satisfied with Leaves of Grass (by far the most of it) as expressing what was intended, namely, to express by sharp-cut self assertion, <hi rend="italic">One's-Self</hi> &amp; also, or may be still more, to map out, to throw together for American use, a gigantic embryo or skeleton of Personality, fit for the West, for native models&#8212;but there are a few things I shall carefully eliminate in the next issue, &amp; a few more I shall considerably change.<ptr target="nyp.00196_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>I see I have said I consider Drum-Taps superior to Leaves of Grass. I probably mean as a piece of wit, &amp; from the more simple &amp; winning nature of the subject, &amp; also because I have in it only succeeded to my satisfaction in removing all superfluity from it, verbal superfluity I mean. I delight to make a poem where I feel clear that not a word but is indispensable part thereof &amp; of my meaning.</p>
            <p>Still Leaves of Grass is dear to me, always dearest to me, as my first born, as daughter of my life's first hopes, doubts, &amp; the putting in form of those days' efforts &amp; aspirations&#8212;true, I see now, with some things in it I should not put in if I were to write now, but yet I shall certainly let them stand, even if but for proofs of phases passed away&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother &amp; all home are well as usual. Not a word for over three months from my brother George<ptr target="nyp.00196_n5"/>&#8212;the probabilities are most gloomy. I see the Howells<ptr target="nyp.00196_n6"/> now &amp; then. I am well, but need to leave here&#8212;need a change. If you see Miss Howard tell her Jesse Mullery<ptr target="nyp.00196_n7"/> has been to see me&#8212;came yesterday &amp; has just left this forenoon. He talked of nothing but her. His life is saved, &amp; he will have tolerably good strength &amp; health, at least for present. His address is Ward <ptr target="nyp.00196_n8"/>, Centre st Hospital, Newark New Jersey. I was up at Mrs Price's the other night. She is better this winter. Mrs Paulina Wright Davis7 is stopping with her this winter. I have sent a paper with sketch of Hospital Visits, to Dr Wm F Channing.<ptr target="nyp.00196_n9"/> I cannot forgive myself for not acknowledging his assistance for the Hospitals, by letter at the time. I send you another paper also, as you might like it. I take it by a line in your letter that Charles Eldridge has not gone to Boston.<ptr target="nyp.00196_n10"/> I have been reading the strange articles from the Richmond press.<ptr target="nyp.00196_n11"/> A thousand Satans baffled, with terror, hatred, malignant squirming, appear in every paragraph. Little California is playing around me as I finish, &amp; has been for half an hour. Love to dear Nelly &amp; Jeannie &amp; all.</p>
