                got acquainted in Canada two years ago, &#38; quite attached to each other&#8212;he
                was a soldier there&#8212;I got a letter from him from Montreal day before

                who had come on here some time ago quite sick&#8212;Young A. wanted me to see &#38;
                write to him how the father was particular&#8212;So I went up to-day&#8212;when I
