                <salute>Mr. Walt Whitman,</salute>
                <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am a stranger to you, but have long been an admirer of your writings.<!--<ptr target="nyp.00496_n4"/>--> Perhaps you
                have heard of me as at one time editor of the "Radical Review," which published J.
                B. Marvin's<!--<ptr target="prc.00047_n4"/>--> admirable essay entitled "Walt Whitman." The action of the Massachusetts
                authorities and the cowardice of the Osgoods<!--<ptr target="upa.00201_n2"/>--> prompt me to write to you. I am ashamed
                of the whole business. What do you propose to do? Some steps should be at once taken
                for the republication of your book, from the same plates, in the same locality where
                it has been struck down. Is there no one that will undertake it? With able counsel
                to conduct the case I do not believe a jury could be
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc_vm.00434_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                     found in Massachusetts to send the
                publisher of "Leaves of Grass" to prison. At any rate the question ought to be tested.
                If I had the means, I would gladly, with your permission, put your book on the
                market advertised as the suppressed edition, and invite the authorities to dispute
                my right to do so. What I will do is this, if nothing better can be done. If you
                will find parties to furnish the means for republication from your plates,
                advertising the book, and defending it in court, I will become the responsible
                publisher, and go to prison if necessary. In case the verdict should be against me
                and I should be fined, I should decline to pay the fine. It seems to me highly
                important that the people of America should know exactly how far they can safely
                indulge in the expression of their opinions. What do you say? If you desire to know
                anything about me before <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc_vm.00435_large.jpg"
                    type="recto"/> replying to so important a question, you may inquire of S. H.
                Morse, Quincy, Mass., the sculptor,<!--<ptr target="n0862"/>--> whom you know, and who has long been one of my
                intimate friends. He does not know of my design in this matter, but he will tell you
                that I am thoroughly reliable, and no notoriety-hunter or anything of that kind.</p>
            <closer>
                <salute>Yours indignantly,</salute>
