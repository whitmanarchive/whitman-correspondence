                <salute>Dear son Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I am still doing as well as when I last wrote&#8212;I have many alternations, but upon the whole 
                have no reason to complain of the last ten days. My head has some bad spells, 
                &amp; a touch or more nearly every day, &amp; my locomotion is still as clumsy as ever&#8212;but for all that I am happy in not having any of those spasms of three weeks since, 
                &amp; indeed I have <hi rend="underline">glimpses</hi> again of my <hi rend="underline">real self</hi>&#8212;have had two or three such, 
                of an hour or two each&#8212;which I felt very encouraging. Your letter came Tuesday, 
                &amp; I wrote you a few lines on a postal card, which I suppose you rec'd next day. 
                I went to Tommy Osler's, the young RR man's funeral last Sunday&#8212;it was near here&#8212;poor fellow, he used always to stop a minute at the window, 
                &amp; talk off hand &amp; cheerful&#8212;Pete he often made me think of you, dear son&#8212;he was your age &amp; size&#8212;he was an only son&#8212;I go out now about every day, 
                my strength is certainly improving&#8212;shall go out this afternoon&#8212;</p>

            <p>About an hour ago the big Adams Express wagon drove up to the door, with a box for me&#8212;it was 2 doz 2 lb cans of fresh Oregon salmon from St. Louis, from my brother Jeff&#8212;I am very fond of it for breakfast, can eat it every day&#8212;(My appetite is pretty fair, 
                but I must have just the things I want, <choice><orig>cant</orig><reg>can't</reg></choice> eat any others)&#8212;Pete your description 
                of the old Evangelical Alliance fellows, as if they had just walked out of Noah's Ark, 
                made me laugh heartily&#8212;you just hit it&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>I have just got a long letter from Mrs. O'Connor&#8212;she is in Massachusetts&#8212;returns to Washington in November&#8212;How are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, &amp; Ed, &amp; all&#8212;give them my love&#8212;tell Ed I shall yet want him to build me <hi rend="underline">that small house</hi>&#8212;I send my love to Wash Milburn&#8212;I am writing this up in my room, 3 o'clock, 
                pleasant weather, sun shining, window open&#8212;I am feeling quite fair to-day. 
                
            </p>
