            </p>
            <p>I got home from Ark yesterday, after a pretty hard time&#8212;I had to abandon my Texas trip for the reason that I had some bids here to be opened on Monday  I did not get here till Wednesday&#8212;but that was owing to the weather and the Rail Roads  I shall go out to the cemetery on Sunday and leave Sunday night for Texas. I suppose I shall be gone about a week  Mr Smith<ptr target="mhs.00001_n2"/> of Leavenworth was at my office on Monday last and came for the express purpose of carrying me off to New York all expenses paid&#8212;but of course I could not go&#8212;much as I wanted to&#8212;No I must make the best of what is wanted now&#8212;I presume I shall have lots of time after awhile&#8212;</p>
            <p>Well my dear girl I wish you would go and do just what gives you the most fun&#8212;and I do hope you will make fast friends of the New York and Hartford people&#8212;they are good folk to know</p>
            <p>I shall write Horace<ptr target="mhs.00001_n3"/> that you are at Worthens<ptr target="mhs.00001_n4"/> after the 1st for ten days&#8212;I think he will call and ask you to go to his place&#8212;and if he does I would like to have you go</p>
            <p>Nothing new with me&#8212;I am feeling fairly well&#8212;except I have my old terrible cough&#8212;it is pulling me down some&#8212;but I shall get out all right when the spring comes</p>
            <p>Wish you would go and see Walt as often as you can</p>
