                <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>There is great excitement here over the returns of yesterday's elections, 
                as I suppose there is the same in Washington also—the Democrats look blue enough, 
                &amp; the Republicans are on their high horses.<ptr target="loc.01590_n2"/> I suppose Grant's success is now certain. 
                As I write, the bands are out here, parading the streets, &amp; the drums beating. 
                It is now forenoon. Tonight we will hear the big guns, &amp; see the blazing bonfires. 
                It is dark &amp; cloudy weather here to-day. I was glad to get your letter of Friday, 
                9th which is the last<ptr target="loc.01590_n3"/>—also a Star at same time. Also this morning, Star and Express 
                to 12th. I suppose you rec'd mine of the 9th &amp; the papers. I am about as well as usual. 
                Mother is well, &amp; my brothers the same. I am going to-morrow to Providence, R. I., 
                to spend a few days. Should you write any time within four or five days after receiving this, 
                direct to me <hi rend="italic">care of Hon. Thomas Davis, Providence, R. I.</hi><ptr target="loc.01590_n4"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>My friend O'Connor is quite unwell, and is absent from Washington away down 
                on the New England coast.<ptr target="loc.01590_n5"/> I received a letter from him yesterday. 
                I believe I told you I was finishing up about 230 copies of my book, 
                expecting to sell them. I have had them finished up &amp; bound &amp;c. but there 
                is a hitch about the sale, &amp; I shall not be able to sell them at present. 
                There is a pretty strong enmity here toward me, &amp; L. of G., among certain classes—not only that it is a great mess of crazy talk &amp; hard words, all tangled up, 
                without sense or meaning, (which by the by is, I believe, your judgment about it)—but others sincerely think that it is a bad book, improper, &amp; ought to be denounced 
                &amp; put down, &amp; its author along with it. There are some venemous but laughable 
                squibs occasionally in the papers. One said I had received 25 guineas for a piece 
                in an English magazine, but that it was worth all that for any one to read it. 
                Another, the <hi rend="italic">World</hi>, said "Walt Whitman was in town yesterday, carrying the 
                blue cotton umbrella of the future."<ptr target="loc.01590_n6"/> (It had been a drizzly forenoon)—So they go it. 
                When they get off a good squib, however, I laugh at it, just as much as any one.
            </p>
            
            <p>Dear Pete, I hope this will find you well &amp; in good spirits. Dear boy, 
                I send you my love. I will write you a line from Providence. So long, Pete.
            </p>

            <postscript>
                <p>I have been debating whether to get my leave extended, &amp; stay till election day to vote—or whether to pair off with a Democrat, &amp; return (which will amount to the same thing.) 
                    Most likely I shall decide on the latter, but don't know for certain.<ptr target="loc.01590_n7"/></p>
