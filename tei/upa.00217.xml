            <p>I like with all my heart (&#38; head too) "A memorandum at a venture". It is as clear as daylight to me that you speak truth&#8212;invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope &#38; promise &#38; impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in this truth since it burst upon me a veritable

            share of the profits. I am very glad you have written these clear strong words for the North American.</p>
            <p>A real pleasure it is to see John Burroughs&#8212;both for your sake&#8212;for it seems in a kind of way almost like seeing you&#8212;&#38; for his own. What eyes he has for the ways of the whole dumb world. He has gone just now to my favorite Haslemere, in quest of nightingales&#8212;&#38; I hope

            will make the acquaintance of an excellent friend of mine there to whom I gave an introduction Unluckily Herby is away&#8212;painting some portraits in Monmouthshire with which he has succeeded well. He has also sold his Academy picture&#8212;&#38; will be back in time to see John Burroughs on his way <choice><abbr>thro'</abbr><expan>through</expan></choice> <gap reason="illegible" unit="chars" quantity="8"/>.
