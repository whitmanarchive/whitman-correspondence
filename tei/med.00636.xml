            <p>I have just returned from a two weeks' visit down in the Jersey pine woods and had a good time in the simple, savage way I like. Am well for me, sunburnt and fat. (Some twitchings, but I don't dwell on them.) Nothing very new in my affairs, sell a couple of books occasionally.</p>
            
            <p>I suppose you saw my Riddle Song in the first number of Sunnyside Press<ptr target="med.00636_n2"/>&#8212;if not, I can send you the "Progress" with it in.</p>
            
            <p>I delivered my Lincoln lecture last April 15 in Philadelphia&#8212;the same as the N.Y. version. I took it very coolly and enjoyed it&#8212;(No great audience&#8212;&#36;90, after paying expenses).</p>
            
            <p>Mr. Abbott of Boston wrote to me for a poem for his May 22d "Emerson Number" of the "Literary World." I could not write him a poem, but I sent him a little prose criticism which I believe he is to print in said number.<ptr target="med.00636_n3"/></p>
            
            <p>Dr. Bucke is coming here to Philadelphia about May 22.<ptr target="med.00636_n4"/> Eldridge passed through here day before yesterday, returning to Washington . . . .</p>
            
            <p>I had the May "Scribner" and read it leisurely down in the woods&#8212;Stedman's Poe, and your "Notes."<ptr target="med.00636_n5"/> (Scratched off my Emerson screed down there, as it was there I <choice><abbr>rec'd</abbr><expan>received</expan></choice> Abbott's letter.)</p>
            
            <p>I hear from the Gilchrists; they are in London; the daughter Beatrice has suddenly abandoned her medical pursuits and intentions. Herbert thrives<ptr target="med.00636_n6"/>. . . .</p>
            
            <p>I hear at second remove, and vaguely, that Symonds is writing a book, or something, about me.</p>
            
            <p>. . . When you write, send me Smith Caswell's exact post office address, so I can send him papers.<ptr target="med.00636_n7"/> Don't forget.</p>
                
            <p>Is it <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who says so emphatically the blackbirds don't sing? What they call here the Virginia blackbird, with red dabbed shoulders&#8212;Harry Stafford says they do, at times, and very finely (and I say so, too)&#8212;How are you? How the arm? how the babe? Love to 'Sula&#8212;</p>
