        <salute>Dear Son,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I am sitting here in my room, having just eat a hearty dinner with my mammy<ptr target="n0705"/>, (who has this
        month entered on her 76th year,<ptr target="loc.01534_n2"/> but to my eyes looks young &amp;
        handsome yet.) It is a dark &amp; cloudy day, &amp; the rain is just now pouring down in
        torrents. It is a great disappointment to many, as Farragut's funeral celebration<ptr
          target="loc.01534_n3"/> was to come off to&#8211;day, &amp; all the military, &amp;
        Departments here, &amp; hundreds of societies, orders, schools &amp;c. had prepared to turn
        out&#8212;&amp; most of them did turn out, this forenoon, only to get soaked with rain,
        &amp; covered with mud&#8212;I saw one crack battalion, all so spruce &amp; handsome, with
        white pants, &amp; silver gray coats, &amp; every thing so bright &amp; trim when they
        marched down&#8212;&amp; an hour &amp; a half afterwards, they looked like draggled roosters
        that had been pumped on&#8212;</p>

      <p>We have had weeks and weeks of the very finest weather up to early this morning, &amp; now
        it is the worst kind to be out in. Still we want rain so very much, one <choice>
          <orig>dont</orig>
          <reg>don't</reg>
        </choice> feel to complain. </p>

      <p>Pete, I rec'd your last letter, the 26th&#8212;it was a good long, lively letter, &amp;
        welcome&#8212;you write about the Signal Corps<ptr target="n0561"/>&#8212;Allen<ptr
          target="loc.01534_n4"/> deserves credit for persevering &amp; studying&#8212;&amp; I hope
        he will do well&#8212;&amp; think he will too&#8212;for he is sober, &amp; tries to get
        ahead&#8212;any how he is a young man I like&#8212;Thornett<ptr target="loc.01534_n5"/> is a
        very intelligent manly fellow, cute, plucky, &amp;c&#8212;he has one fault, &amp; a bad
        one&#8212;that is he will drink, &amp; spree it&#8212;which spoils all&#8212;True it is none
        of my business, but I feel that it would be perhaps the making of him, if he would give it
        up, &amp; find his pleasure in some other way&#8212;Pete, should you see Allen again, give
        him my love&#8212;&amp; the same for Thornett also&#8212;</p>

      <p>Did you mean for me to write what I think of your joining the Signal Corps? But are you
        proficient enough in studies? I heartily advise you to peg away at the arithmetic&#8212;do
        something at it every day&#8212;arithmetic is the foundation of all such things&#8212;(just
        as a good stone wall is the foundation for a house)&#8212;become a good arithmetician first
        of all&#8212;&amp; <hi rend="italic">you surely will, if you keep pegging away a little
          every day</hi>&#8212;how much leisure you have after all, that might be used for
        study&#8212;I don't mean all your leisure, but say one hour out of every three&#8212;then
        keep looking over the geography&#8212;when I come back I will bring a little pocket
        dictionary&#8212;with 15 minutes writing every day, &amp; correcting by the dictionary I
        would warrant you becoming a correct speller &amp; real handsome writer in a year or
        less&#8212;&amp; when one is a fair arithmetician &amp; spells &amp; writes finely, so many
        things are open to him. </p>

      <p>As things stand at present I expect to be back by or before next Sunday.<ptr
