            <p>Your letter came this morning, &amp; as I think my loving boy is so touchy <choice><abbr>ab't</abbr><expan>about</expan></choice> it, (he says he has writ <hi rend="italic">three</hi> letters, but I can't make out but <hi rend="italic">two</hi>) I will sit right down &amp; send him a letter. I am feeling well&#8212;only as I was out with some friends Sunday night,<ptr target="nyp.00406_n2"/> I was foolish enough to take a good strong drink, &amp; eat a couple of slices of rich cake late at night&#8212;&amp; <hi rend="italic">I shan't do any thing of the kind again</hi>. But I am pretty well, dear son, &amp; feel more able &amp; sassy every day&#8212;&amp; we will have some good times yet. Harry, I don't know the particulars about the Herbert scrape, but you must let up on him&#8212;I suspect you said something pretty tantalizing before he <choice><abbr>call'd</abbr><expan>called</expan></choice> you that&#8212;Let it go&#8212;Of course I shan't say any thing about it to any one&#8212;<ptr target="nyp.00406_n3"/></p>

A good many of the young fellows are friends of mine&#8212;I am invited, but it will be too boisterous for me, &amp; I shan't go&#8212;If you was here you should go, as it would suit you.</p>
            
            <p>I wish I was down by the pond <choice><orig>to-day</orig><reg>today</reg></choice> for a couple of hours, to strip &amp; have a good bath&#8212;It is very close &amp; hot here&#8212;</p>
                
            <p>There is a great rush now to the country&#8212;every train most is full&#8212;it is quite a sight to go to the ferry, Philadelphia side, &amp; see the stream of people, men, women &amp; children, old &amp; young, some really funny characters&#8212;I go once in a while &amp; take a look at the sight&#8212;</p>

            <p>We are all well&#8212;as soon as I finish this I shall go out for a couple of hours before dinner&#8212;(it is now between 11 and 12)&#8212;</p>
