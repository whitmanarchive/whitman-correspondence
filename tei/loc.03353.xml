            <p>The book and photographs (for Ruskin)<ptr target="n3013"/> have arrived safely, and as soon as I hear from Ruskin of their receival by him I will let you know. At present he is away from home, and I have written to him to ask where he will have them addressed to.</p>
            
            <p>When I sent him the 'extracts', I did not imagine it possible that he had never <hi rend="underline">heard</hi> of you, and even <hi rend="underline">now</hi> I feel sure he must have heard of you, but have taken little notice of the hearing, as so much that he hears is so

            unworthy of <choice><sic>rememrance</sic><corr>remembrance</corr></choice>. But when he <hi rend="underline">read</hi> the extracts, he seemed to be astonished, for I have never before heard of him using such a term as 'glorious' respecting any writings.</p>
            
            <p>A little over a year ago, he had a brain fever, and I think that has caused him to forget many things he previously remembered. But if he had <hi rend="underline">read</hi> your writings, I feel sure he would not have forgotten you altogether.</p>
            
            <p>Ruskin is a great, good man. He is not only a beautiful writer, but a beautiful worker, and he
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.03353.003.jpg" type="recto"/>
            will always <hi rend="underline">do</hi> what he thinks he should do, even at the hazard of 'death' or disrepute. But I will write more of him in another letter.</p>
            
            <p>What I have in me to say to you on my own account cannot be uttered in any words. Through poverty and calumny you have been a constant encourager and faithful and beloved supporter. You have indeed led me into strifes but you have rendered infinite help, and, though I may have 'grinned,' I have steadfastly borne the temporary pain and
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.03353.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
            have continued faithful.</p>
            
            <p>You translated hitherto hidden languages for me; you opened my eyes, which had before been only partly open. You set me to work.</p>
            
            <p>The Companions were hard to find, in the body, but until they appeared I had <choice><sic>consolatation</sic><corr>consolation</corr></choice> with the old companions and those yet to come&#8212;for I am a dreamer also.</p> 
            
            <p>Now I have found a few companions&#8212;all 'poor'&#8212;but your faithful lovers. Of these I hope to write to you in a future letter.</p>
            
            <p>It would be for me the greatest pleasure to be</p>
