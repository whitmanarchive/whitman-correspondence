                <salute>Dear Hattie (&#38; all the rest)</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I came up here last Thursday afternoon in the steamboat from <choice><abbr>N Y</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice>&#8212;a fine day, &#38; had a delightful journey&#8212;every thing to interest me&#8212;the constantly changing but ever beautiful panorama on both sides of the river all the way for nearly 100 miles here&#8212;the magnificent north river bay part of the shores of <choice><abbr>N Y</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice>&#8212;the high straight walls of the rocky Palisades&#8212;the never-ending hills&#8212;beautiful Yonkers&#8212;the rapid succession of handsome villages &#38; cities&#8212;the prevailing green&#8212;the great mountain sides of brown &#38; blue rocks&#8212;the river itself&#8212;the innumerable elegant mansions in spots peeping all along through the woods &#38; shrubbery&#8212;with the sloops &#38; yachts, with their white sails, singly or in fleets, some near us always, some far off&#8212;&#38;c &#38;c &#38;c&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>&#38; here I am, this is now the third day having a good time&#8212;Mr Burroughs &#38; his wife are both kind as they can be&#8212;we have plenty of strawberries, cream &#38;c &#38; something I specially like, namely plenty of sugared raspberries &#38; currants&#8212;(I go out &#38; pick the currants myself, great red things, bushels of them going to waste)&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Albert Johnston, (the Jeweler's son, I am staying with in <choice><abbr>N Y</abbr><expan>New York</expan></choice>) is here too on a visit to the Burroughs's&#8212;&#38; makes it still more agreeable&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday we all (Mr B, Al &#38; I) went out on a long drive&#8212;I tell you it is very different country here from out west, or down in Jersey&#8212;the old stone fences, two feet thick&#8212;the scenery&#8212;the many splendid locust trees, often long rows of great big ones&#8212;the streams down the mountains, with waterfalls&#8212;"Black Creek"&#8212;the Cattskills, in the distance&#8212;all did me good. It is lucky the roads are first rate (as they are here) for it is up or down hill or around something continually&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>We pass'd many <hi rend="italic">tramps</hi> on the roads&#8212;one squad interested in me&#8212;it was a family of five (or six) in a small flat <choice><sic>ricketty</sic><corr>rickety</corr></choice> one-horse open wagon, with some poor household traps huddled together, some new baskets for sale (they were basket makers I suppose) &#38; some three young children&#8212;the man driving, the woman by his side, thin &#38; sickly, &#38; a little babe wrapt in a bundle on her lap, its little feet &#38; legs sticking out towards us as we went by&#8212;</p>

            <p>On our return at sundown a couple of hours afterwards, we met them again&#8212;they had hauled aside in a lonesome spot near the woods, evidently to camp for the night&#8212;the horse was took out &#38; was grazing peacefully near by&#8212;the man was busy at the wagon, with his baskets &#38; traps, &#38; the boy of 11 or so had gather'd a lot of dry wood &#38; was building a fire on the open ground&#8212;As we went on a little on the road we encounter'd the woman with the little baby still in her arms, &#38; her pretty-eyed 6 year old barefoot girl trotting behind, clutching her gown&#8212;the woman had two or three baskets she had probably been on to neighboring houses to sell&#8212;we spoke to her &#38; bought a basket&#8212;she didn't look up out of her old sunbonnet&#8212;her voice, &#38; every thing seem'd queer, <hi rend="italic">terrified</hi>&#8212;then as we went on, Al stopp'd the wagon &#38; went back to the group to buy another basket&#8212;he caught a look of the woman's eyes &#38; talked with her a little&#8212;says she was young, but look'd &#38; talk'd like <hi rend="italic">a corpse</hi>&#8212;the man was middle aged&#8212;</p>
          
            <p>I am having a good quiet time here&#8212;eat lots of strawberries, raspberries &#38; currants&#8212;(O I wish Lou could have a lot of the latter to do up)&#8212;I am well&#8212;To-day for a change it is raining&#8212;but altogether I have enjoyed fine June weather for my trip&#8212;Will finish my letter in New York&#8212;</p>
