            <p>I rec'd this morning your additional contribution of $5 for the wounded &amp; sick. The same am't from you was also duly &amp; thankfully received last month. It is some time since I have written you.<ptr target="nyp.00187_n3"/> I have lately been down to front a second time through the field hospitals&#8212;they are breaking them up &amp; sending the bad cases up here. I suppose preparatory to some movement of course. Among the sick diarrhea &amp; rheumatism are prevalent. Many of the cases of the latter suffer fearfully. I am writing this in hospital as I am watching here to-night over a bad case.</p>
            <p>(Describe scene.)<ptr target="nyp.00187_n4"/>
            </p>
            <p>With me here things are about the same. I have first-rate health &amp; strength. My hospital ministrations are very fascinating with all of their sadness. The wounded &amp; sick get incredibly near to one. Poor young men, they respond so affectionately to kindness &amp; magnetism.<ptr target="nyp.00187_n5"/>
            </p>
            <p>I suppose you hear of Grant's plan to improve enormously the communication between here &amp; the southwest by rail &amp;c. so that he can transport the army by immense trains hither &amp; yon at short notice. They say he has staked all on taking Richmond within three months. God prosper him.</p>
            <p>Our Virginia Army is in prime condition. This I know from personal observation. All its defeats &amp; slaughters have only hardened it, &amp; made it an army of fighters. I believe Grant realizes in his secret heart that it is the clear superior in fibre &amp; soul of his Western Army, but of course he would not say so.</p>
         <p>Dear friend, the sick are coming in here now from front pretty freely. I have need of means additional&#8212;The new sick &amp; wounded generally come in without a cent. I give aid of all kinds, sometimes little sums of money. You have been generous &amp; regular in your aid, &amp; I cannot call on you for any thing more than you are doing, but I would like you to cast around among your friends, show them this note, &amp; tell them the case&#8212;see if you could raise among them some 20 or $25 the ensuing week, if possible, for it is for a sacred object.<ptr target="nyp.00187_n100"/>
