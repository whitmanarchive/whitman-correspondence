            <p>
                I want to thank
                you again for your
                kindness,&#8212;your kind
                remembrance of me. Christmas did
                me good, for at times
                I feel very friendless
                I only wish I could do
                something for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Walt dear I think
                too much of you to annoy
                you in any way. I think
                so much about home such
                a wish for you to get
                quite well. I should <hi rend="underline">never</hi>
                forgive myself, it would
                be the worst trouble I ever
                had, if I said <choice><sic>annything</sic><corr>anything</corr></choice>
                to hurt you in the least
                speaking or complaining
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.00663.004.jpg" type="verso"/>
                don't mend things, and I
                write so seldom. I should
                at least write a <choice><sic>cheerfull</sic><corr>cheerful</corr></choice>
                letter, but Charlie has just
                come home from down town
                says he has been writing
                to you (perhaps he has not
                I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know whether to believe
                him or not) I am so
                uneasy I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what
                to do. I am so afraid he
                has said something that
                will worry you dear brother
                I know he does write fearful
                letters, every word the most
                untrue and unjust &amp; he's written a great many for
                I have opened and read them.
                I only want you to know that
                he cannot or does not say
                <hi rend="underline">one word of truth</hi> ever or
                at any time, when he
                speaks of me. I know
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.00663.005.jpg" type="recto"/>
                he writes to his sisters &amp; others
                very badly of me indeed, and have
                been told that he talks
                ill of me to any one and
                everyone that will listen.
                (he to day received a New Years
                present a box of <choice><orig>hankerchiefs</orig><reg>handkerchiefs</reg></choice> from
                his sister &amp; niece, &amp; letter of great
                sympathy for him in his
                unhappy home. they think
                it might do him good to come
                to them &amp;c, two <choice><orig>hankerchiefs</orig><reg>handkerchiefs</reg></choice>
                were for me, they are nice,
                but I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> appreciate them
                as I would, if they knew
                me as I am.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Dearest Brother I want
                you to know that I write
                to day feeling very unhappy
                and anxious, for fear Charlie
                has written something <choice><sic>disagreable</sic><corr>disagreeable</corr></choice>, if he has written &amp; you
                will mind it, you would
                understand why if you had</p>
                <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.00663.006.jpg" type="verso"/>
                <p>Dear Brother in my hurry I made 
                a mistake, thought this was written on
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope with my whole heart that
                I have not said anything to make
                you feel bad for a moment, <hi rend="underline">you must not</hi>
                that I could not endure. Generally I get along
                well as most persons, to day I am worried and
                excited, probably if I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#nhg" cert="low">waited</unclear> till to morrow
                I should write differently. Next time dear
                brother I will write cheerfully, may be when you
                get this I will feel happy again. I have thought
                often if I should die <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#ak" cert="low">someday</unclear>, I should not like Charlie to say I
                was crazy. (I am likely to live as he) &amp; you not know his way
                I used to be too sensitive to speak, but lately so many have
                spoken to me of it. its too absurd to mind I know
                <!-- Upside down on same page -->
                I do mind it. I have some comforts. I think a
                great deal of my home with all my troubles
            </p>
            <p>
                I have only spoke of myself &amp; could not help it today
