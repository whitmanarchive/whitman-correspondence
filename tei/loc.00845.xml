            <p>I am not only alive, but as well &amp; hearty as ever I was&#8212;&amp; more [than] that, I often think about you, Alfred, &amp; retain the same friendship that we formed when I used to sit down on your bed when you was so low in the hospital. If I hadn't got your letter of 23d, I should likely have written to you very soon, of my own accord, for I thought about you the last few weeks in particular. I have been home in Brooklyn the last two months, to see my mother, &amp; pay a visit to New York, &amp;c. and I only returned day before yesterday. I am still employed in this Department, shall probably remain here through the winter, (although nothing is certain now-days)&#8212;Washington is rather dull&#8212;no more soldiers around like there used to be&#8212;no more patrols marching around the streets&#8212;no more great racks of hospitals&#8212;I get along well enough in this city in pleasant weather, when one can go around, but it's rough in bad weather.</p>
            <p>Al, I got the picture, dear boy, &amp; I have it yet, &amp; take good care of it, &amp; take a good look at it every now &amp; then&#8212;I think it is a good likeness. It is now a year ago since you sent it&#8212;you spoke in that letter of your parents&#8212;You must give my love to them, &amp; if it should be practicable I should like much to make them a call&#8212;but yet it does not seem likely as things are at present. But I wonder whether we shall ever come together again, you &amp; I, my loving soldier boy. O how much comfort it would be to me, if things were so that we could have each other's society&#8212;for I think so much of such things.</p>
            <p>I am writing this at my table by a big window in the Office, where I can look out &amp; see the Potomac away down to Alexandria, &amp; across all up &amp; down Arlington Heights, &amp; near at hand the grounds south of the President's House&#8212;it is a splendid day to-day, bright &amp; clear &amp; just cool enough&#8212;&amp; I feel in good health&#8212;&amp; all the better on account of your letter arriving. Well I must draw to a close.</p>
            <p>I hope, dear comrade, you are trying to be an honorable &amp; upright young man, for that is more than the greatest worldly prosperity, or learning either.</p>
            <p>I send you my love, &amp; must now bid you farewell for present, dear soldier boy.</p>
