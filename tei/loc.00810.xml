               <salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am still stopping down in this region. I am a good deal of the time down within half a mile of our picket lines, so that you see I can indeed call myself in the front. I stopped yesterday with an artillery camp, in the 1st Corps, at the invitation of Capt Cranford,<ptr target="loc.00810_n1"/> who said that he knew me in Brooklyn. It is close to the lines&#8212;I asked him if he did not think it dangerous&#8212;he said no, he could have a large force of infantry to help him there, in very short metre, if there was any sudden emergency&#8212;The troops here are scattered all around, much more apart than they seemed to me to be opposite Fredericksburgh last winter&#8212;they mostly have good huts &amp; fireplaces, &amp;c&#8212;I have been to a great many of the camps, &amp; I must say I am astonished how good the houses are almost every where&#8212;I have not seen one regiment nor any part of one, in the poor uncomfortable little shelter tents that I saw so common last winter, after Fredericksburgh&#8212;but all the men have built huts of logs &amp; mud&#8212;a good many of them would be comfortable enough to live in under any circumstances<ptr target="loc.00810_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>I have been in the Division hospitals around here&#8212;there are not many men sick here, &amp; no wounded&#8212;they now send them on to Washington&#8212;I shall return there in a few days, as I am very clear that the real need of one's services is there after all&#8212;there the worst cases concentrate, &amp; probably will, while the war lasts&#8212;</p>
            <p>I suppose you know that what we call hospital here in the field, is nothing but a collection of tents, on the bare ground for a floor, rather hard accommodations for a sick man&#8212;they heat them here by digging a long trough in the ground under them, covering it over with old railroad iron &amp; earth, &amp; then building a fire at one end &amp; letting it draw through &amp; go out at the other, as both ends are open&#8212;this heats the ground through the middle of the hospital quite hot&#8212;I find some poor creatures crawling about pretty weak with diarrhea&#8212;there is a great deal of that&#8212;they keep them till they get very bad indeed, &amp; then send them to Washington&#8212;the journey aggravates the complaint, &amp; they come into Washington in a terrible condition&#8212;O mother, how often &amp; how many I have seen come into Washington, from this awful complaint, after such an experience as I have described&#8212;with the look of Death on their poor young faces&#8212;they keep them so long in the field hospitals with poor accommodations, the disease gets too deeply seated&#8212;</p>
            <p>To-day I have been out among some of the camps of the 2d division of the 1st Corps&#8212;I have been wandering around all day, &amp; have had a very good time, over woods, hills, &amp; gullys, indeed a real soldier's march&#8212;the weather is good &amp; the traveling quite tolerable&#8212;I have been in the camps of some Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, &amp; New York regiments&#8212;I have friends in them, &amp; went out to see them, &amp; see soldiering generally, as I never cease to crave more &amp; more knowledge of actual soldiers' life, &amp; to be among them as much as possible&#8212;This evening I have also been in a large wagoners' camp&#8212;they had good fires, &amp; were very cheerful&#8212;I went to see a friend there too, but did not find him in&#8212;it is curious how many I find that I know &amp; that know me&#8212;Mother, I have no difficulty at all in making myself at home among the soldiers, teamsters, or any&#8212;I most always find they like to have me very much, it seems to do them good, no doubt they soon feel that my heart &amp; sympathies are truly with them, &amp; it is both a novelty &amp; pleases them &amp; touches their feelings, &amp; so doubtless does them good&#8212;&amp; I am sure it does that to me&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is more fun around here than you would think for&#8212;I told you about the theatre the 14th Brooklyn has got up,<ptr target="loc.00810_n3"/> they have songs &amp; burlesques &amp;c, some of the performers real good&#8212;As I write this I have heard in one direction or another two or three good bands playing&#8212;&amp; hear one tooting away some gay tunes now, though it is quite late at night&#8212;Mother, I dont know whether I mentioned in my last letter that I took dinner with Col Fowler<ptr target="loc.00810_n4"/> one day early part of the week&#8212;his wife is stopping here&#8212;I was down at the 14th as I came along this evening too&#8212;one of the officers told me about a presentation to George of a sword &amp;c, he said he see it in the papers<ptr target="loc.00810_n5"/>&#8212;the 14th invited me to come &amp; be their guest while I staid here, but I have not been able to accept&#8212;Col Fowler uses me tip top&#8212;he is provost marshal of this region, makes a good officer&#8212;Mother, I could get no pen &amp; ink tonight&#8212;Well, dear Mother, I send you my love &amp; to George &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; little girls &amp; all&#8212;</p>
