            mother i give him a little change
            and as i supposed he wanted
            it for himself as edd<ptr target="duk.00425_n13"/> said
            he had a boy waiting for him outside
            loo<ptr target="duk.00615_n6"/>  wanted me when she was here

            said she was on the street
            the night before and dreadful
            to read) the boy said it was a
            strange boy she said he must
            wait for an answer i told
            the boy i was sorry for her but
            i had no money to help her
            she said in the letter i could take
