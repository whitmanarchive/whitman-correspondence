            had her hat and all on ready they were
            to go yesterday but it stormed so they put
            it off till to day and its worse yet matt wants
            to go very much i was willing she should
            go but i would have had a pretty hard

            so frightened she concluded to take her
            and the storm so bad i thought it was endangering

            Jeff is pleased with his visit to washington
            he likes the Oconors<ptr target="duk.00474_n10"/> very much says he
                spent a very <choice><orig>agreable</orig> <reg>agreeable</reg></choice> evening there
            we are very much pleased with mr
            Heydes<ptr target="duk.00557_n13"/> present to you the scenery is
            beautiful Jeff told me how near you
            come to upset all the sympathy between
            you and your brother in law) you speak
            about sending the papers Walt but i think
            it would not be worth while<ptr target="duk.00474_n17"/>
            once in a while
            i see the tribune<ptr target="duk.00474_n11"/>
            i <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> get very much
            time between georges coming up every day
            and the children up here nearly all the time
            but i like so to read the speakery in the house
            i read <choice><orig>Chandlers</orig> <reg>Chandler's</reg></choice> speech and i generally see
            the sunday paper davis takes the times every
            day but he is so queer about it leaves it
            over to the office<ptr target="duk.00474_n16"/>
            Jeff says for to not ask him for
            it i got your letter walt yesterday with
            the 5 dollars i feel Walt sometimes as if you
            was too <choice><orig>liberall</orig><reg>liberal</reg></choice> with me but its all i have except
            sometimes 15 or 20 cents and i pay the rent too one
            month Jeff only charged me 5 dollar matty says
            he has to pay just the same as they did before
            they took the long room Jeff is very kind to
            me i wonder sometimes he is for every little
            thing is told him even to burning a little wood
            when i ought to burn coal but i let every thing slide
            along but i think matty gets better) but we get along pretty well
            my arm is about the same no worse nor much better
            take all the comfort you can walt</p>
