            <p>I have been quite unwell, a bad spell with my head, worse than usual, nine or ten
                days&#8212;I kept up, but had no comfort&#8212;the last two days it is easier, &#38;
                it is passing over apparently, for the present<ptr target="mhs.00017_n1"

            <p>&#8212;Lou I think I would like to have you or George put up my letters (not the books or
                papers) in a package, &#38; send them to me here, 2316 Pine street,&#8212;if it <choice>

                be 6 cts an ounce by mail)&#8212;(or if George thinks best, send by
                express&#8212;that is if the parcel is too big)&#8212;please do it soon as
                convenient&#8212;there is <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="mhs.00017.002_large.jpg"

                here perhaps two weeks longer&#8212;It is very hot here for this season, indeed as
                hot as we had it in July there in Camden&#8212;I go out most every day, Jeff has
                taken me out riding very often, &#38; I have been everywhere within several miles,
                &#38; in all the outer parts of the City which are the roomiest &#38; the
                pleasantest by far of any city I have ever seen&#8212;Jeff is very kind indeed,
                &#38; I am agreeably fixed here&#8212;&#38; since I am here so far, &#38; shall
                probably never come again, I have concluded to stay awhile&#8212;The girls are well
                &#38; hearty &#38; send their love&#8212;Hatty is down <pb xml:id="leaf002r"

                write&#8212;I have not written any thing for publication yet here, as I have not
                felt well, but I want to, before I leave, as this trip is a great revelation,
                especially the Colorado journey, &#38; the mountains&#8212;</p>
