        <salute>My dear Rudolf Schmidt<ptr target="n0793"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>Your letter of Jan. 2<ptr target="rlc.00008_n1"/> has just reached me here. I am always
        glad to get word from you. Write oftener. I have been very ill&#8212;now just a
        year&#8212;from paralysis &amp; <hi rend="italic">cerebral anæmia</hi>. I have been at
        death's door myself&#8212;&amp; during the year have lost my dear mother<ptr target="n0705"
        /> &amp; a dear sister<ptr target="n0707"/> by death. </p>

      <p>I sent you a newspaper, with account, five months since, but as you do not allude to it I
        suppose you did not receive it. I send another by this mail. (I have sent you several papers
        &amp; magazines the past year.) I am not in bed but up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a little
        every day, &amp; shall probably get well again&#8212;But I remain paralyzed yet&#8212;walk
        with difficulty &amp; very little&#8212;have bad spells in my head&#8212;&amp; ameliorate
        very slowly&#8212;Still I write &amp; publish a little&#8212;Mental faculties not affected. </p>

      <p>I have at present no thought of visiting England.<ptr target="rlc.00008_n2"/> In a letter
        two years since Tennyson kindly invited me to come to his house<ptr target="rlc.00008_n3"
        />&#8212;which aroused some thought &amp; wish for a time&#8212;but it has passed away. </p>

      <p>What have I heard about some great German University, proposing for one of its prizes, for
        some annual or bi-annual literary <hi rend="italic">f&#234;te</hi>, the question, <hi
          rend="italic">Has America really produced any real poet?</hi> Have you heard any thing of
        such a discussion? </p>

      <p>What about Bjornson? Is he coming to America? If so, give him my address, &amp; tell him to
        come &amp; see me. (It is almost a part of Philadelphia, where I now live&#8212;on the
        opposite side of the Delaware river.) </p>

      <p>When you write, or send me (the Danish) Democratic Vistas, direct here. Write me from
        Germany,
        <address>
                <addrLine>Walt Whitman</addrLine>
                <addrLine>431 Stevens street,</addrLine>
                <addrLine>Camden, N. Jersey.</addrLine>
                <addrLine>U. S. America</addrLine>
            </address>
      </p>

      <p>(I have not given up my place in the Solicitor's office, Washington&#8212;but keep up
        communication&#8212;&amp; if I get well, expect to go back there)&#8212;I want to hear all
        about Bjornson&#8212;</p>
