            <p>Your second letter (dated July 9) came an hour ago&#8212;welcomed, &#38; read twice

                &#38; chat deeply interesting to me&#8212;I think much of all genuine efforts of the
                human emotions, the soul &#38; bodily &#38; intellectual powers, to exploit
                themselves for humanity's good&#8212;the <hi rend="underline">efforts in
                    themselves</hi>, I mean (sometimes I am not sure but <hi rend="underline"
                    >they</hi> are the main matter)&#8212;without stopping to calculate whether the
                investment is tip-top in a business or statistical point of view. These libations,
                ecstatic life-pourings as it were of precious wine or <hi rend="underline"
                    >rose</hi>-<hi rend="underline">water</hi> on vast desert sands or great polluted river&#8212;taking

            <p>We have had a week of furious hot weather here&#8212;&#38; are having it
                yet&#8212;(seems to have concentrated in &#38; around Philadelphia)&#8212;I keep
                pretty well, considering&#8212;dont go out at all till toward sundown, but get on
                the river two or three hours afterwards every even'g&#8212;I send in Phil. Press my
                last little piece<ptr target="loc.01345_n3"/>&#8212;you must chew upon it a
                little&#8212;my inward idea in it being the least literary or <hi rend="underline"
                    >poetical</hi>, &#38; most physiological &#38; scientific&#8212;</p>
            <p>My last letter from Dr. Bucke spoke of his going off with a sick friend &#38;
                relative to the Canadian Rockies, a jaunt of six or seven weeks&#8212;I have heard
                lately from John Burroughs&#8212;he has been writing quite a piece ab't Matthew
                Arnold, which I <choice><sic>tho't</sic><corr>thought</corr></choice> at first I w'd send you, but I believe I won't&#8212;as it is
                not very clear or encouraging&#8212;rather <hi rend="underline"

            <p>Ab't myself &#38; my own affairs there is nothing new or special to write, Mary dear.
                My house-lady Mrs. Davis continues to be in every respect (handiwork &#38;
                atmosphere) the very best and most acceptable that could have befallen me&#8212;Hot
                as it is, &#38; with several kind invitations away, I remain for the summer at my
                shanty in Mickle Street&#8212;upon the whole it is best for me&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mary, I hope your next letter will tell me of a visit to Mrs. Gilchrist&#8212;As I
                close it suggests itself to me that I prepare one of the big photos (the one with
                hand up to mouth) &#38; send you to give to the Toynbee? Hall folk&#8212;Love to you
                &#38; all</p>
