               <salute>Dear M.,</salute>

            <p>I am writing this in the hospital, sitting by the side of a soldier, I do not expect to last many hours. His fate has been a hard one&#8212;he seems to be only about 19 or 20&#8212;Erastus Haskell<ptr target="med.00302_n2"/>, company K, 141st N. Y.&#8212;has been out about a year, and sick or half-sick more than half that time&#8212;has been down on the peninsula&#8212;was detail'd to go in the band as fifer-boy. While sick, the surgeon told him to keep up with the rest&#8212;(probably work'd and march'd too long.) He is a shy, and seems to me a very sensible boy&#8212;has fine manners&#8212;never complains&#8212;was sick down on the peninsula in old storehouse&#8212;typhoid fever. The first week this July was brought up here&#8212;journey very bad, no accommodations, no nourishment, nothing but hard jolting, and exposure enough to make a well man sick; (these fearful journeys do the job for many)&#8212;arrived here July 11th&#8212;a silent dark-skinn'd Spanish-looking youth, with large very dark blue eyes, peculiar looking. Doctor F. here made light of his sickness&#8212;said he would recover soon, &amp;c.; but I thought very different, and told F. so repeatedly; (I came near quarreling with him about it from the first)&#8212;but he laugh'd, and would not listen to me. About four days ago, I told Doctor he would in my opinion lose the boy without doubt&#8212;but F. again laugh'd at me. The next day he changed his opinion&#8212;I brought the head surgeon of the post&#8212;he said the boy would probably die, but they would make a hard fight for him.</p>
            <p>The last two days he has been lying panting for breath&#8212;a pitiful sight. I have been with him some every day or night since he arrived. He suffers a great deal with the heat&#8212;says little or nothing&#8212;is flighty the last three days, at times&#8212;knows me always, however&#8212;calls me "Walter"&#8212;(sometimes calls the name over and over and over again, musingly, abstractly, to himself.) His father lives at Breesport, Chemung county, N. Y., is a mechanic with large family&#8212;is a steady, religious man; his mother too is living. I have written to them, and shall write again to-day&#8212;Erastus has not receiv'd a word from home for months.</p>
            <p>As I sit here writing to you, M., I wish you could see the whole scene. This young man lies within reach of me, flat on his back, his hands clasp'd across his breast, his thick hair cut close; he is dozing, breathing hard, every breath a spasm&#8212;it looks so cruel. He is a noble youngster,&#8212;I consider him past all hope. Often there is no one with him for a long while. I am here as much as possible.</p>
