            <p>I have not heard any thing of George or the reg't or Corps more than I have already written&#8212;I got Jeff's letter on Sunday, &amp; wrote to him next day, which you have seen, mother, of course&#8212;I have written to Han &amp; sent her George's letter to me dated 16th&#8212;I have heard that the 9th Corps has been moved to the extreme left of the Army&#8212;I should think by acc'ts this morning that the Army must be nearly half way from Fredericksburgh to Richmond<ptr target="loc.00830_n1"/>&#8212;the advance can't be more than 30 to 35 miles from there&#8212;</p>
            <p>I see Fred McReady about every other day, I have to go down to Alexandria, about 6 miles from here&#8212;he is doing quite well, but very tired of the confinement&#8212;I still go around daily &amp; nightly among wounded&#8212;Mother, it is just the same old story, poor suffering young men, great swarms of them come up here, now, every day, all battered &amp; bloody&#8212;there have 4000 arrived here this morning, &amp; 1500 yesterday&#8212;they appear to be bringing them all up here from Fredericksburgh&#8212;the journey from the field till they get aboard the boats at Bell Plain is horrible&#8212;I believe I wrote several times about Oscar Cunningham, 82d Ohio, amputation of right leg, wounded over a year ago, a friend of mine here, he is rapidly sinking, said to me yesterday, O if he could only die&#8212;the young lad Cutter, of 1st Massachusetts heavy artillery, I was with Sunday afternoon, (I wrote about in Jeff's letter,) still holds out, poor boy, there is no chance for him at all&#8212;</p>
            <p>But, Mother, I shall make you gloomy enough if I go on with these kind of particulars&#8212;Only I know you like to hear about the poor young men, after I have once begun to mention them&#8212;Mother, I have changed my quarters&#8212;am at 502 Pennsylvania av. near 3d street, only a little way from the Capitol&#8212;where I was, the house was sold &amp; the old lady I hired the room from had to move out &amp; give the owner possession&#8212;I like my new quarters pretty well&#8212;I have a room to myself, 3d story hall bedroom, I have my meals in the house.</p>
            <p>Mother, it must be sad enough about Nance, &amp; the young ones&#8212;is the little baby still hearty, I believe you wrote a few weeks after it was born that it was quite a fine child<ptr target="loc.00830_n2"/>&#8212;I see you had a draft in the 3d Congressional district, I was glad enough to see Jeff's name was not drawn&#8212;We have had it awful hot here, but there was a sharp storm of thunder &amp; lightning last night, &amp; to-day it is fine&#8212;Mother, do any of the soldiers I see here, from Brooklyn or New York, ever call upon you?&#8212;they sometimes say they will, here&#8212;tell Jeff I got a letter yesterday from W E Worthen, in which he sent me some money for the men, I have acknowledged it to Mr W by letter<ptr target="loc.00830_n3"/>&#8212;Well, dear mother, I must close, O how I want to see you all&#8212;I will surely have to come home as soon as this Richmond campaign is decided&#8212;then I want to print my next book&#8212;love to Mat&#8212;write to a fellow often as you can&#8212;</p>
