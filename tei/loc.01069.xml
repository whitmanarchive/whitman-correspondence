            <p>Haveing this morning received a letter from Lieut William Caldwell of our regiment who was taken prisoner the same time that Your Brother George was<ptr target="loc.01069_n2"/> I write you to <add type="insertion" status="unremarkable">let you</add> know that Your Brother is still alive and well.  I will give you the names of the Officers with him just as he gave them to me viz Major Wright, Capt Whitman, Lieuts Ackerson, Tooley, Sims, Waldron, Carberry, Hoyne, Groenemyer, Loughsen, Whitbeck, and Murden<ptr target="loc.01069_n3"/> 
               <pb facs="loc.01069.002.jpg" type="verso"/> he did not say in his letter where the men were and I hardly think he knew, or he would a have mentioned it.  He writes that they are short of provisions and requests me to send him a box, if nothing more than salt pork and hard tack.  So of course they must be pretty hard up for grub or he would not run the risk of haveing it sent through the lines.  I have sent to Walton to send to Lt. Caldwell a box of Stores.  And I would say if you could send some to George the same time it would come verry exceptable to him no doubt.  I wished I was where I could have a hand in fixing up something <pb facs="loc.01069.003.jpg" type="recto"/>for my old comrade, but here we cannot get anything.  So I am going to trust to our friends at home to look out for all hands.</p>
            <p>Everything is quiet along our lines except just at this present time it is a raining verry hard, which makes it verry disagreeable for all that are on Picket.  but I shall have to bring this to a close by Sending my best respects to Your Mother and Your Self hoping to hear from you soon</p>
