            <p>Lewy, your letter of August 10 came safe, &amp; was glad to hear all about you, &amp; the way you are spending the time&#8212;Lew, you must be having first rate times out there&#8212;well you need something to make up what you have suffered&#8212;You speak of being used well out there&#8212;Lewy, I feel as if I could love any one that uses you well, &amp; does you a kindness&#8212;but what kind of heart must that man have that would treat otherwise, or say any thing insulting, to a crippled young soldier, hurt in fighting for this union &amp; flag? (Well I should say damned little man or heart in the business)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Should you meet any such, you must not mind them, dear comrade, &amp; not allow your feelings to be hurt by such loafers&#8212;(I agree with you that a rebel in the southern army is much more respectable than a northern copperhead.) Dear son, when I read about your agreeable visit of a week, &amp; how much you enjoyed yourself, I felt as much gratified as though I had enjoyed it myself&#8212;&amp; I was truly thankful to hear that your leg is still doing well, &amp; on the gain&#8212;you must not mind its being slowly, dear son, if it only goes forward instead of backward, &amp; you must try to be very careful of your eating &amp; drinking &amp;c., not indulge in any excesses, &amp; not eat too much flummery, but generally plain food, for that is always best, &amp; it helps along so much.</p> 
            <p>Lewy, I believe I wrote you an acc't of the presentation to Dr Bliss&#8212;he is now off north for three weeks&#8212;Dr Butler<ptr target="loc.00888_n1"/> (ward D) is in charge&#8212;some of the doctors &amp; wardmasters have been drafted&#8212;poor Johnny Mahay<ptr target="loc.00888_n2"/> is not in very good spirits&#8212;he was to have an operation performed before Bliss went, but he went off &amp; did not do it&#8212;Johnny is pretty low some days&#8212;Things in ward K are pretty much the same&#8212;they had some improvem'ts in the Hospital, new sinks, much better, &amp; the grounds in front &amp; between the wards nicely laid out in flowers &amp; grass plots &amp;c.&#8212;but, Lew, it has been awful hot in the wards the past two weeks, the roofs burnt like fire&#8212;</p>
            <p>There is no particular war news&#8212;they are having batches of conscripts now every day in the Army&#8212;Meade is down on the upper Rappahannock &amp; fords, &amp; around Warrenton&#8212;Lee stretches down toward Gordonsville, they say his head quarters is there&#8212;folks are all looking toward Charleston&#8212;if we could only succeed there, I don't know what secesh would do&#8212;the ground seems to be slipping more &amp; more from under their feet&#8212;Lew, the <hi rend="italic">Union</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="italic">American Flag</hi> must conquer, it is destiny&#8212;it may be long, or it may be short, but that will be the result&#8212;but O what precious lives have been lost by tens of thousands in the struggle already&#8212;</p>
            <p>Lew, you speak in your letter how you would like to see me&#8212;well, my darling, I wonder if there is not somebody who would be gratified to see you, &amp; always will be wherever he is&#8212;Dear comrade, I was highly pleased at your telling me in your letter about your folks' place, the house &amp; land &amp; all the items&#8212;you say I must excuse you for writing so much foolishness&#8212;nothing of the kind&#8212;My darling boy, when you write to me, you must write without ceremony, I like to hear every little thing about yourself &amp; your affairs&#8212;you need never care how you write to me, Lewy, if you will only&#8212;I never think about literary perfection in letters either, it is the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi>&#8212;Lewy, I am feeling pretty well, but the sun affects me a little, aching &amp; fulness in the head&#8212;a good many have been sun-struck here the last two weeks&#8212;I keep shady through the middle of the day lately&#8212;Well, my dear boy, I have scribbled away any thing, for I wanted to write you to-day &amp; now I must switch off&#8212;good by, my darling comrade, for the present, &amp; I pray God to bless you now &amp; always.</p>
