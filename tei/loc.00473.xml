            <p>I received your letter and I do not think you can form an idea how very badly I feel to hear that you are not recovering faster.<ptr target="loc.00473_n1"/> I do so sincerely hope that you are right in your theory that the slow recovery indicates permanency&#8212;I hope to God, my dear Brother that you may permanently recover&#8212;</p>
            <p>Not much new with me&#8212;I have had several outside jobs lately that will pay me I think in time but so far they are only sources of investment</p>
            <p>How do you get along on money matters? do not fail to let me know if you have any prospect of being short  I read with much regret mother's statement about the eating at George's,<ptr target="loc.00473_n2"/>  it does seem too bad that with every chance to make things good and happy they should fail so completely on so small a cause. I hope you may carry out your idea of getting a little place in Washington and have Mother live there  It would be happiness indeed for her, and for you too for that matter</p>
            <p>I cannot understand how it is that Loo is so stingy nor how it is that George does not correct it<ptr target="loc.00473_n3"/>&#8212;I would suppose he would (and naturally he is so) prevent it at once</p>
            <p>Hattie wrote you a few days ago&#8212;I hope you have it ere this</p>
            <p>Write me when you can and let me know if you are in want of a little money</p>
