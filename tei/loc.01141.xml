                <salute>Dear Walt:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have delayed writing to you longer than I intended to. We had a pleasant passage
                over, &amp; have been as happy as sight seers can expect to be. We keep pretty well
                &amp; take things easy. My first taste of the country was at Alloway, Burns'
                birth place. We spent a week here in a cozy little inn on the banks of the Doon,
                surrounded by one of the sweetest &amp; finest farming countries I ever beheld. From
                there we went up into the Highlands, where I did some
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01141.004_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
                     mountain climbing: thence around
                to Edinburgh. From there we went down to Carlyle's country &amp; spent a week at
                Ecclefechan, arriving there the 1<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">st</hi></hi> day of June just as the first red clover was
                beginning to bloom. I walked a good deal about Ecclefechan &amp; shall write something
                about it &amp; weave in certain things I want to say of Carlyle. I enclose a daisy &amp;
                a spray of speedwell that I gathered from Carlyles grave. There is no stone yet
                marking his grave. I saw the graves of 8 "Thomas Carlyles." The "Carlyls" as the
                Scotch call them were a numerous race in this section. They were a stern savage set,
                not to be trifled with. One old Scotchman said they were "bullies." Then we went
                down into the Lake region for a few days;
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01141.005_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
                     &amp; thence to London. Mr.
                Carpenter has been up &amp; spent a day &amp; a night with me. He has recently lost his
                father. He is well. We have been out to Mrs. Gilchrist's twice to tea She &amp; Grace
                are alone, Herbert being off in Wales, painting. They chided me for not bringing
                you, &amp; entertain hopes of seeing you yet. They are well &amp; have a pleasant cheery
                house. You would have a good time if you were to come. I have seen no one else in
                London &amp; do not expect to. Rossetti I hear is not well. We shall leave here
                to-morrow, or I shall, for Haslemere &amp; thence through some of the Southern
                Countries for a week; wife &amp; Julian will stay with an old acquaintance of ours at
                Brentford, near London. I presume we shall be home in August. June has been cold &amp;
                wet

                heat, no warmth.</p>
            <p>Conway has an article on Emerson in the June Fortnightly Review, but it is hasty &amp;
                of not much account. I hope to hear yet that Osgood has not thrown up <hi
                    rend="underline">Leaves of Grass</hi>. I expect a letter from O'Connor every
                day. Drop me a line care of <hi rend="underline">Henderson Brothers, 51 Union Street,
                    Glasgow</hi> Scotland.</p>
