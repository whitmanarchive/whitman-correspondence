                <salute>Bro Walt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Just recieved Springfield paper, with extended notices of Walt Whitman. Came
                opportunely, for Han was growing nervous not recieveing any letter or card from you. She
                sprang right up, renewed, although she is not very strong as yet. And I was glad too,
                I assure you. Han is steadily improving; rather weakly and gray, but ambitious and
                systematic.</p> 
            <p>I have been dreadfull sick too, but can now breathe nearly as well as usual. Every
                body congratulates me.</p>
            <p>We was as glad to learn that you are so comfortable with widow Davis:<ptr target="duk.00404_n1"/> Han says
                    she would so like
                to see her and talk with her: and so <pb xml:id="leaf001v"
                    facs="duk.00404.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> would I tell her so. My father was
                a sea captain; sailed from Philadelphia to France was wrecked, lost at sea: <choice>
                    <sic>rember</sic>
                    <corr>remember</corr>
                </choice> both of us to her: But what is the matter with Geo and Lou.<ptr target="n1046"/> I sent a small
                painting to them some months ago, framed, at 15 dollars with request to return it if
                not agreeable: have written twice, but recieved no reply.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Geo is short of cash; still they keep the picture view from our house, with
                the Lake (Battery view) where you used to stroll. <unclear reason="margins cut off"
                    cert="low" resp="#aa">Warm</unclear> Han has large room up stairs to herself.
                I have small room adjoining: that I can hear, if she needs any thing: she is down
                stairs every day&#8212;cooks, I make fire etc&#8212;Han sends
                love&#8212;talks of you.</p>
