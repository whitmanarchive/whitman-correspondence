        <salute>My dear Rudolf Schmidt<ptr target="n0793"/>,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>My lonesomeness &amp; sickness here, (for I am still sick, &amp; here,) have been much
        rejoiced <choice>
          <orig>to&#8211;day</orig>
          <reg>today</reg>
        </choice> by my getting your good &amp; copious letter of 28th February, on your return to <choice><orig>Kopenhagen</orig><reg>Copenhagen</reg></choice>. I rec'd with it the <hi rend="italic">Fatherland</hi> with Mr. Rosenberg's<ptr target="n0519"/> criticism<ptr target="rlc.00003_n1"/>&#8212;which (perhaps luckily for
        me) I cannot now read&#8212;but will one of these days have translated &amp; read to me. I
        keep it very carefully&#8212;as I do all you send me&#8212;&amp; shall yet read and commune
        with, &amp; dwell upon &amp; absorb <hi rend="italic">all</hi> thoroughly &amp; at
        leisure&#8212;(especially your own review in the <hi rend="italic">Ide</hi>.) I think
        probably <hi rend="italic">all</hi>&#8212;certainly <hi rend="italic"
        >most</hi>&#8212;papers, sheets, &amp;c. you have sent me to Washington, have reached me
        here&#8212;the post office forwards them here&#8212;I <choice><orig>rec'd</orig><reg>received</reg></choice> two complete copies <hi rend="italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</hi><ptr
          target="n0189"/>, &amp; one copy in sheets&#8212;also three copies picture paper <hi
          rend="italic">Folkeblad</hi>, with my portrait,<ptr target="rlc.00003_n2"/> which is most
        excellent&#8212;(and the notice I will have read to me)&#8212;I rec'd at the time, a year
        ago, the translation of Swedish and Norwegian poems, you sent me, acknowledged it, but the
        letter seems to have missed you, &amp; have read it &amp; had much pleasure, &amp; am to
        read it more&#8212;I also rec'd from Clausen your picture, which I have with me&#8212;&amp;
        prize. A friend lately looking at it said, "Why, he looks like a born Yankee&#8212;&amp; of
        the best." </p>

      <p>I wrote you March 4th, acknowledging <hi rend="italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</hi>, &amp;
        sent you (one in <hi rend="italic">Harper's Magazine</hi>, &amp; one extracted in the N. Y.
          <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>) my two latest pieces <hi rend="italic">Song of the Redwood
          Tree</hi>, (California,) and <hi rend="italic">Prayer of Columbus</hi>, which I suppose
        you have rec'd all&#8212;For the last ten weeks I have not felt inclined to write&#8212;have
        suffered in the head&#8212;walk hardly any, (from the paralysis,) but maintain good spirits,
        keep up in body &amp; face, (my brother &amp; sister said at dinner yesterday that portrait
        in the <hi rend="italic">Folkeblad</hi> looks greatly like me now, &amp; has caught the true
          <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> better than any of them.) In body I have always been,
        &amp; still remain, <hi rend="italic">stout</hi>, in the American sense, (i.e. <hi
          rend="italic">not</hi> corpulent)&#8212;</p>

      <p>In my letter of March 4 I wrote a few lines about Clemens Petersen<ptr
          target="rlc.00003_n3"/>&#8212;my only interview with him was about 40 minutes, one very
        rainy Sunday, nearly two years since in New York&#8212;he was just recovering from an attack
        of erysipelas which had left large red blotches on his face&#8212;two other visitors were
        just leaving&#8212;C. P. received me very kindly &amp; talked well&#8212;all was agreeable,
        but under the circumstances I could not say much nor stay long&#8212;received a pleasing but
        passing, &amp; not very pronounced impression&#8212;which is the reason, my dear friend,
        that I have not written more fully&#8212;Partly too I have been waiting expecting that
        perhaps somehow C. P. and I would meet again, &amp; talk more &amp; get better acquainted,
        &amp; I could write you further&#8212;but I have not seen any thing of him since&#8212;&amp;
        only seen some of his pieces casually in the magazines. I have not heard him or them
        mentioned here in America&#8212;certainly no essay in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>
        magazine nor any thing of his elsewhere in English that I have seen has attracted any
        special attention nor deserves it&#8212;shows nothing of the <hi rend="italic">forte</hi> or
        heartiness of which I have no doubt he is capable&#8212;(I think your letter &amp; opinion
        of C. P.'s essay, of last summer, have missed me.)&#8212;I cannot understand your allusions
        to Bjornson<ptr target="rlc.00003_n4"/>&#8212;as you will be doubtless aware yourself. </p>

      <p>The same <hi rend="italic">hardness</hi>, crudeness, worldliness&#8212;absence of the
        spiritual, the purely moral, <choice><orig>esthetik</orig><reg>aesthetic</reg></choice>, &amp;c&#8212;are in Democracy here too&#8212;(though there are signs &amp;
        awakenings here very plain to me)&#8212;probably in Great Britain, &amp; in Europe &amp;
          everywhere&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, it is much counterbalanced &amp; made up by
        an immense &amp; general basis of the eligibility to manly &amp; loving comradeship, very
        marked in American young men&#8212;but generally, I am the more disposed to be satisfied
        with the case as it is because I see that the only foundations &amp; <hi rend="italic">sine
          qua non</hi> of popular improvement &amp; Democracy are <hi rend="italic">worldly &amp;
          material success established first</hi>, spreading &amp; intertwining everywhere&#8212;<hi
          rend="italic">then</hi> only, but then surely for the masses, will come spiritual
        cultivation &amp; art&#8212;they will then firmly assert themselves&#8212;</p>

      <p>Thank you for the graphic line&#8211;sketch you write of Bismark, in your letter. My own
        opinion is, that we can well afford&#8212;I will say, <hi rend="italic">such as you &amp;
          I</hi>, can well afford, to let those little &amp; great <hi rend="italic">chunks of
          brawn</hi>&#8212;Attilas, Napoleons, Bismarks&#8212;prepare the way, &amp; cut the roads
        through, for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.<ptr target="rlc.00003_n5"/>
      </p>

      <p>Write me <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, till further notice&#8212;let me hear what is said
        about <hi rend="italic">Vistas</hi> or my poems&#8212;let me hear always of yourself fully. </p>
