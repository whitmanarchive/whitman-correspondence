            <p>We all arrived safely at Pittsburgh abt 2 oclk to-day&#8212;Mattie and the children stood the journey first-rate&#8212;and Mat seems to feel fully as well as in Brooklyn  I find I shall probably have to stay here longer than I anticipated&#8212;possibly shall not get away tomorrow but hope to&#8212;</p>
            <p>We had quite a pleasant time in coming on&#8212;Mrs Rice<ptr target="loc.00446_n2"/>&#8212;(with child and nurse) met us at the Depot&#8212;I succeeded in getting a state room in the sleeping car&#8212;and was particularly fortunate in doing so&#8212;as many were left out or rather had to get along without sleep</p>
            <p>I write this merely to tell you that we got through so far all right&#8212;and also to send you this [t?]<ptr target="loc.00446_n3"/>&#8212;Mat has worried about my not giving it to you ever since we came away&#8212;you must thank her for it not me&#8212;for to tell you the truth, dear old Mamma I have so much to think about that I do not remember you as often as I ought to.</p>
            <p>Mattie sends love to you and all&#8212;I ditto&#8212;and the young ones likewise, will write again from St Louis as soon as we get there</p>
