                answer at once&#8212;for I am ever so glad to know you have not forgot me, as I have
                not you, Tommy boy. I heard by some London boy I met quite a while ago that you was
                married &#38; I supposed since you had your hands full of business, new associations
                &#38;c.</p>
            <p>Tom, I will just tell you about things&#8212;I still live in the same quarters in
                Camden, but shall soon break up permanently from here. I keep pretty well&#8212;feel
                as well as when I last saw you, &#38; I suppose look <choice>

                years&#8212;&#38; especially this past summer (which has been a remarkably fine one
                here.) My two books bring me in a moderate income<ptr target="duk.00777_n2"

            <p>Tom, give my best regards to your wife, for all I have no acquaintance with her
                yet&#8212;I wish to be remembered to any of the Asylum boys I knew there who yet
                remain&#8212;I remember well the kindness of them all, &#38; the gay old rides
                around&#8212;Tom, do you recollect that Sunday evening you drove the women in town
                to church, &#38; we had a sociable drive all around?&#8212;that was the time we
                first got acquainted&#8212;I have been thinking a good while of coming on to visit
                Dr Bucke again, &#38; then I will come &#38; see you<ptr target="duk.00777_n3"
