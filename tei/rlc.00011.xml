      <p>As you have <choice>
          <orig>rec'd</orig>
          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice> my letter of April 25, you know that the copies of <hi rend="italic"
          >Demokratisk&#8211;Fremblik</hi><ptr target="n0189"/> and of some six newspapers with
        criticisms, safely reached me here&#8212;&amp; one or two more since&#8212;&amp; now,
        yesterday, <hi rend="italic">Dags Telegrafen</hi><ptr target="rlc.00011_n1"/>&#8212;all of
        which I treasure, &amp; am to have carefully read to me. </p>

      <p>I am still unwell enough to make me remain here, quite idle, but am encouraged to still
        keep up the expectation of getting quite well&#8212;&amp; indeed am improving, though
        slowly&#8212;I enclose a piece of mine just written for Commencement Poem to a College near
        Boston city&#8212;the College is the headquarters of the Universalists&#8212;my piece is to
        be read by proxy&#8212;</p>

      <p>I enclose you some pieces more on <hi rend="italic">American humor</hi>, as you are
        interested in that subject&#8212;&amp; a very amusing &amp; 'cute letter by a lady about the
        darkeys down South&#8212;American humor, (like the old Greek, and now the best Italian,
        Spanish, French humor) is, in a sense <hi rend="italic">the other side or opposite radiation
          of pensiveness, &amp; even mystery &amp; hypochondria</hi>&#8212;I think it more
        idiosyncratic &amp; untranslatable than any I have mentioned, Greek, Italian,
        &amp;c&#8212;It is <hi rend="italic">entirely different</hi> from the English, or
          English&#8211;German<ptr target="rlc.00011_n2"/>&#8212;</p>

      <p>We have been having one of our American hot&#8211;weather spells&#8212;real
        hell&#8211;blasts&#8212;here lately&#8212;four, five, six days. But I have stood them very
        well indeed. <choice>
          <orig>To&#8211;day</orig>
          <reg>Today</reg>
        </choice> as I sit here writing by the open window, there is a sufficiently cool breeze,
        &amp; it is very agreeable &amp; moderate, though just past noon. When you write mention
        whether you <choice>
          <orig>rec'd</orig>
          <reg>received</reg>

        <hi rend="italic">Redwood Tree</hi><ptr target="n0578"/> and also <hi rend="italic">Prayer of Columbus</hi><ptr
          target="n0482"/>, both sent March 4. (The <hi rend="italic">address</hi> on the last
        papers &amp; letters to me is exactly right, &amp; is sure to reach me.) I intend to send
        Kristian Elster<ptr target="n0216"/> a copy of my poems, &amp; my photograph&#8212;how shall
        I address him? John Burroughs has been to visit me here&#8212;he is settled on a little farm
        of his own on the Hudson river, 60 miles north of New York city. Your photo. sent in the
        letter of April 4 is before me as I write. </p>
