            </opener>
            <p>I sent Jeff a letter on Sunday, I suppose he got at the office&#8212;I feel so anxious to hear from George, one cannot help feeling uneasy, although these days sometimes it cannot help being long intervals without one's hearing from friends in the army&#8212;O I do hope we shall hear soon, &amp; that it is all right with him&#8212;it seems as if the 9th corps had returned to Vicksburgh, &amp; some acc'ts say that part of the corps had started to come up the river again&#8212;toward Kentucky I suppose&#8212;I have sent George two letters within a week past,<ptr target="loc.00781_n1"/> hoping they might have the luck to get to him, but hardly expect it either&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I feel very sorry to hear Andrew is so troubled in his throat yet, I know it must make you feel very unhappy&#8212;Jeff wrote me a good deal about it, &amp; seems to feel very bad about Andrew's being unwell&#8212;but I hope it will go over, &amp; that a little time will make him recover&#8212;I think about it every day<ptr target="loc.00781_n2"/>&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, it has been the hottest weather here that I ever experienced, &amp; still continues so&#8212;yesterday &amp; last night was the hottest&#8212;still I slept sound, have good ventilation through my room, little as it is, (I still hire the same room in L street)&#8212;I was quite wet with sweat this morning when I woke up, a thing I never remember to have happened to me before, for I was not disturbed in my sleep &amp; did not wake up once all night&#8212;Mother, I believe I did not tell you that on the 1st of June (or a while before) the O'Connor's, the friends I took my meals with so long, moved to other apartments, far more room &amp; pleasanter&#8212;not far off though, I am there every day almost, a little&#8212;so for nearly two months &amp; a half I have been in the habit of getting my own breakfast in my room &amp; my dinner at a restaurant&#8212;I have a little spirit lamp, &amp; always have a capital cup of tea, &amp; some bread, &amp; perhaps some preserved fruit&#8212;for dinner I get a good plate of meat &amp; plenty of potatoes, good &amp; plenty, for 25 or 30 cents&#8212;I hardly ever take any thing more than these two meals, both of them are pretty hearty&#8212;eat dinner about 3&#8212;my appetite is plenty good enough, &amp; I am about as fleshy as I was in Brooklyn&#8212;Mother, I feel better the last ten days, &amp; at present, than I did the preceding six or eight weeks&#8212;there was nothing particular the matter with me, but I suppose a different climate &amp; being so continually in the hospitals&#8212;but as I say I feel better, more strength &amp; better in my head &amp;c.&#8212;About the wound in my hand &amp; the inflammation, &amp;c.<ptr target="loc.00781_n3"/> it has thoroughly healed, &amp; I have not worn any thing on my hand, nor had any dressing for the last five days&#8212;Mother, I hope you get along with the heat, for I see it is as bad or worse in New York &amp; Brooklyn&#8212;I am afraid you suffer from it, it must be distressing to you&#8212;dear mother, do let things go, &amp; just sit still &amp; fan yourself&#8212;I think about you these hot days&#8212;I fancy I see you down there in the basement&#8212;I suppose you have your coffee for breakfast&#8212;I have not had three cups of coffee in six months, tea altogether&#8212;(I must come home &amp; have some coffee for breakfast with you)&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, I wrote to you about Erastus Haskell,<ptr target="loc.00781_n4"/> co K 141st N Y&#8212;his father, poor old man, come on here to see him, &amp; found him dead three days, he had the body embalmed &amp; took home&#8212;they are poor folks but very respectable&#8212;I was at the hospital yesterday as usual&#8212;I never miss a day&#8212;I go by my feelings&#8212;if I should feel that it would be better for me to lay by a while, I should do so, but not while I feel so well as I do the past week, for all the hot weather, &amp; while the chance lasts I would improve it, for by &amp; by the night cometh when no man can work, (ain't I getting pious?)</p>
            <p>I got a letter from Probasco<ptr target="loc.00781_n5"/> yesterday, he sent $4 for my sick &amp; wounded&#8212;I wish Jeff to tell him that it came right, &amp; give him the men's thanks &amp; my love&#8212;</p>
            <p>Mother, have you heard any thing from Han? And about Mary's Fanny<ptr target="loc.00781_n6"/>&#8212;I hope you will write me soon &amp; tell me everything&#8212;tell me exactly as things are, but I know you will&#8212;I want to hear family affairs before any thing else&#8212;I am so glad to hear Mat is good &amp; hearty&#8212;you must write me about Hat &amp; little black head too&#8212;Mother, how is Eddy getting along&#8212;and Jess, is he about the same&#8212;I suppose Will Brown is home all right, tell him I spoke about him, &amp; the Browns too<ptr target="loc.00781_n7"/>&#8212;dearest mother, I send you my love, &amp; to Jeff too&#8212;must write when you can&#8212;</p>
