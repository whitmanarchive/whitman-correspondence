            <p> You will be glad to hear that I am going to republish some of mothers essays;<ptr
                    target="loc.02178_n1"/> giving some account of her beautiful life. May I quote
                from some of your letters to mother?<ptr target="loc.02178_n2"/> and will you help
                me to the extent of lending me, mother's letters to you? those that you have kept? I
                should be glad of them quite soon, as I have got to work already; at present
                thinking over her life is the only thing that I take pleasure in: indeed I am unable
                to get my thoughts away, and I don't want to. </p>
            <p> It will help the book if you can insert the following paragraph <pb
                    xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.02178.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/> or something
                like it in the "<choice><abbr>Phila:</abbr><expan>Philadelphia</expan>

            <p> "A Memoir of the the Late Mrs Anne Gilchrist is being prepared by her family &#38;
                friends, we understand that the volume will contain a large amount of interesting
                correspondence exchanged with a varied circle of acquaintances and friends,
                including amongst others Mr
                and Mrs Carlyle,<ptr target="n0139"/> George Eliot,<ptr target="n3044"/> George Henry Lewes,<ptr target="loc.02178_n4"/>
                William Michael Rossetti<ptr target="n0522"/> and Walt Whitman. Mr. T. Fisher
                    Unwin will publish the work." </p> 
            <p> I and Rossetti have inserted a final paragraph about "free-will-offering",<ptr
                    target="loc.02186_n1"/> giving the amount; as a final whip up to any laggard well wisher. 
           I have just received 10/ from the <choice><abbr>Honble</abbr><expan>Honorable</expan></choice>: Roden Noel,<ptr target="loc.02178_n3"/> who tells
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.02178.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/> me that he
                is just republishing an article about you in volume form. I understand from Rossetti
                that since the last paragraph in Athenaeum;
                he has received several subscriptions. Giddy<ptr target="n0890"/> is fairly well and so is my brother
                Percy,<ptr target="n2000"/> his wife and chubby boy (Alexander G.) Rossetti is staying by the sea for his
                wife's sake, who continues <unclear reason="illegible" resp="#kb" cert="low">steady</unclear>; a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> inclined to
                consumption I fear, is Mrs Rossetti, but not much. I am getting back to my painting
                again and feel a little bit more together, but not much: never did son have such a
                sweet companionable dear mother as mine. </p>
