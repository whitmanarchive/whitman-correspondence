                    of a book for the purpose of forwarding it to you&#8212;But if you require it
                    particularly for future reference you can keep it, as I dare say I could procure
                    an extract from the "Mail" in which it was published after it was read.</p>

                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>At the meeting of the Canadian Institute on Saturday evening, Mr. Kivas Tully, C.
                    E., read an instructive and entertaining paper on the "Inland navigation of
                    Canada." Mr. Tully went into the subject fully, the paper bristling with
                    statistical information of great value to those interested in the subject. As
                    the length of the paper precludes its publication in full, owing to want of
                    space, a few of the most interesting extracts only are given. Mr. Tully
                    commenced by saying that in a former paper read before the Institute, he
                    considered that he proved that to Canada and Quebec belonged the credit of
                    having built and equipped the first steamship that crossed the Atlantic. In
                    addition to the above, Quebec could make another claim, that of having built the
                    first ship which sailed across the ocean from this continent, if the statement
                    in Moine's History of Quebec is correct.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>It has been said that the progressive <choice><sic>Intendent</sic><corr>Intendant</corr></choice> Talon before leaving in 1672 had
                    ordered a ship to be built at Anse des Meres. The first Quebec-built craft which
                    sailed across the ocean had been modelled on the banks of the St. Charles in
                    1703, eleven years later, in 1714 the New England colonists of Plymouth launched
                    the first New England-built schooner which ploughed the briny billows <hi

                    tonnage were launched in the St. Charles from a spot now called "Marine Hospital
                    Cove." Since that time 3,873 ships have been built at Quebec representing a
                    tonnage of 1,285,842 to the 31st December, 1875; 84 ships representing a total
                    of 21,616 tons, having been built in the latter year. The paper then discussed

                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>In a lecture at the Mechanics' Institute at St. Catharines in 1857, by the Hon.
                    W. H. Merritt, it was stated: From the earliest settlement of Upper Canada, in
                    1790, until the opening of the Erie Canal (in 1825), almost every article
                    consumed or produced as far to the eastward as Utica, was conveyed to and from
                    the ocean by the natural outlet of the St. Lawrence. The mode of conveyance at
                    that period was by Canadian batteaux on the St. Lawrence and Mohawk rivers,
                    boats ascending the Mohawk to Rome by a canal connecting Wood creek then down
                    through Oneida Lake and Seneca river to Oswego.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>It is curious to note that Upper Canada followed Lower Canada in about seven
                    years in the inauguration of steamboat <choice>
                        <sic>enterprize</sic><corr>enterprise</corr></choice>, and that there were seven steamboats on Lake Ontario two years after,
                    that number were placed between Quebec and Montreal. But while these two
                    sections were provided with steamboat accommodation the intermediate distance
                    between Kingston and Montreal was still, on account of the interruptions
                    occasioned by the rapids, obliged to content itself with more primitive modes of
                    communication. The flat bottomed batteaux, made of pine boards and narrowed at
                    bow and stern, forty feet by six, with a crew of four men and a pilot; provided
                    with oars, sails, and iron shod poles for pushing, continued to carry in cargoes
                    of five tons all the merchandise that passed to Upper Canada. These batteaux
                    went in brigades, which generally consisted of five boats. Against the swiftest
                    currents and rapids the men poled their way up, and when the resisting element
                    was too much for their strength they fastened a rope to the bow, and plunging
                    into the water dragged her by main strength up the boiling cataract from Lachine
                    to Kingston, the average voyage was ten or twelve days, though it was
                    occasionally made in seven, an average as long as a voyage across the Atlantic
                    now.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>According to the Dominion Public Works Act, 1876, the navigation of the River St.
                    Lawrence and the lakes extends from the Straits of Belle Isle, between
                    Newfoundland and Labrador, to Duluth, Minnesota, at the head of Lake Superior, a
                    distance of 2,384 statute miles, and the distance from the Straits of Belle Isle
                    to Liverpool is 2,234 statute miles, so that the inland navigation of the St.
                    Lawrence is 150 miles longer than the ocean navigation between Liverpool and the
                    Straits of Belle Isle. The sources of the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, and Red
                    rivers interlock in the northern portion of the State of Minnesota, on a plateau
                    estimated at about 1,000 feet above the sea level, and, as may be seen by
                    reference to the map, about the centre of this continent. From the plateau the
                    St. Lawrence runs in an easterly direction to the Atlantic Ocean; the
                    Mississippi in a southerly direction to the Gulf of Mexico, and the Red river in
                    a northerly direction to Hudson's Bay, The area in square miles of Lake
                    Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, has been estimated at 90,000; the
                    area drained, or the water-shed, 335,515 square miles, and their shore lines
                    5,000 miles in extent.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>The inland navigation must, however, be considered, strictly speaking, as
                    commencing at Three Rivers, between Quebec and Montreal, as this point is the
                    head of tide water, being 900 miles west of the Straits of Belle Isle, and 1,434
                    miles from Duluth. The improvements on the lower St. Lawrence, or that portion
                    east of Quebec, and also on the open river and lake navigation to Lake Superior,
                    consists of the construction of harbours and piers, deepening and buoying
                    channels, and erecting lighthouses, the cost of which cannot be less than
                    $3,000,000, as far as can be gleaned from the reports of the Dominion Public
                    Works. A channel was dredged through Lake St. Peter immediately west of Three
                    Rivers, so that vessels drawing 20 feet of water can ascend the river to
                    Montreal, thereby rendering it the head of ocean navigation. The canals above
                    Montreal consist of the Lachine, Beauharnois, Cornwall, Williamsburg, and
                    Welland, on which $35,000,000 have been spent up to the present time. The
                    Lachine was commenced in 1821, and finished in 1825; locks 100 feet long by 20
                    feet in width and 5 feet of water; enlarged in 1848, and now being further
                    enlarged. The length of the locks when completed will be 270 feet, width 45
                    feet, and depth of water 14 feet, the two lower locks to be deepened to 18 feet.
                    The Beauharnois, Cornwall, and Williamsburg canals were opened in 1848, the size
                    of the locks being 200 feet by 45 feet, except the Cornwall, which is 54 feet
                    wide and 9 feet depth of water. Plans have been prepared and arrangements will
                    soon be made, though postponed for the present, for the enlargement of these
                    canals on the same scale as the Lachine. When the improvements and works
                    connected with these enlargements are completed, the cost will not be less than
                    $40,000,000. When the St. Lawrence canals were opened for traffic in 1846,
                    according to the Hon. John Young, "the rivalry for the carrying trade of the
                    great West was fairly begun between Canada and the State of New York." The next
                    improvement which calls for notice is that of the Welland canal, which was
                    commenced in 1824 and completed in 1829. The locks were of wood, 40 in number,
                    100 feet in length, 22 feet in width, with 7 feet of water. This canal was
                    enlarged between 1841 and 1845, the locks being 180 feet by 26&#189; feet, and
                    10 feet of water, except the locks between St. Catharines, which were 200 feet
                    long and 45 feet in width, thereby rendering St. Catharines the head of the St.
                    Lawrence canal navigation. A still further enlargement commenced in 1872, is now
                    in progress, and will soon be completed at a cost of probably $10,000,000 and
                    the locks will correspond with the contemplated enlargement of the St. Lawrence
                    canals. The deepening of the channel through the St. Clair flats by the United
                    States Government in 1870, under a joint arrangement with the Government of
                    Canada for removing obstacles to navigation between Lakes Erie, Huron, and
                    Superior was a great improvement, as vessels drawing 14 feet of water can now
                    pass through the channel. The Sault Ste. Marie canal and locks were constructed
                    by a grant of 750,000 acres of land from the United States to the State of
                    Michigan, the canal having been opened in 1855. This canal is about one mile in
                    length and 70 feet in width, with a total rise of water of 18 feet, and allowing
                    vessels drawing 12 feet of water to pass through, which is proposed to be
                    increased to 14 feet. The total length of the canals is 72 miles and the number
                    of locks 56, with a total rise of 554&#189; feet, from tide-water to the level
                    of Lake Superior, 600 feet, the difference, 45&#189; feet, being the fall allowed
                    in the several portions of the river.</p>
                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>In reference to competition with the Erie Canal, Mr. Tully said:&#8212;As I
                    understand the matter, the question to be answered is this:&#8212;Will the
                    enlargement of the Welland and St. Lawrence canals ensure the diversion of the
                    Western trade from the Erie canal to the St. Lawrence? I think not, for the
                    following reasons:&#8212;Judging by past experiences it appears reasonable to
                    suppose that the bulk of the Western trade having passed the St. Clair river and
                    reached the eastern end of Lake Erie, will find its way to New York by the Erie
                    canal. To compare distances, which is, after all, the important consideration,
                    apart from the question of lockage, it will be found that New York is 68 miles
                    nearer to Buffalo than Quebec, which is taken to represent tide-water. At New
                    York the produce of the West has arrived at the Atlantic ocean, whereas at
                    Quebec the Lower St. Lawrence and the Gulf have to be traversed, a distance of
                    about 800 miles, before the Atlantic ocean is reached. The distance from Quebec
                    to Liverpool is, however, 478 miles shorter than from New York, the respective
                    distances being 2,502, and 2,980. Deducting 68 from 478 the difference in the
                    distance from the eastern end of Lake Erie to Liverpool would be 410 miles, but
                    the high ocean freights, consequent on the supposed dangerous navigation of the
                    Lower St. Lawrence, still concentrates the western trade at New York, and as the
                    Welland and St. Lawrence have never been filled to their utmost, whilst the Erie
                    canal is crowded, even after the recent enlargement, the inference is that the
                    enlarged Welland and St. Lawrence canals would not divert the Western trade, and should there be the slightest
                    possibility of such a result, the State of New York would immediately enlarge
                    the Erie canal in the same proportion, as a trade requiring the expenditure of
                    $50,000,000 to transport it from the West to the seaboard is worth keeping. By
                    the construction of the Georgian Bay canal, 428 miles additional would be saved
                    in distance, besides the annual losses on the St. Clair flats and Lake Erie,
                    which have been estimated to average over $1,000,000. I consider these
                    advantages would alone direct the trade, which it is useless to expect can be
                    accomplished under any other circumstances. It has always struck me as wonderful
                    how little our great natural water ways have been considered, and how completely
                    as commercial highways they have been belittled in value by the Erie canal.
                    Nevertheless, I cannot help thinking that nature has instituted these great
                    waters for a purpose, and the future will show what and how great that purpose
                    is. The Erie canal gathers a revenue of $5,000,000, while our magnificent river,
                    with all its costly improvements, scarce casts its mite into the Treasury. But
                    if the grain storehouses of the West, filled to overflowing, like water in a
                    mill-dam, ever burst forth as an avalanche, and by the impetus of necessity
                    follow new routes, and thus under the impulse of a natural law seek a natural
                    channel, they will then follow the St. Lawrence, naturally as the waters from
                    the lakes flow through it. The expansion of trade on this continent seems to be
                    illimitable.</p>

                <p><handShift rend="printed"/>We print this morning the annual statement of the business done in Chicago during
                    the year which closed yesterday. The aggregate of values of the wholesale trade
                    amount to $621,500,000 currency, as against $652,000,000 in 1876, or, computing
                    the paper dollar at an average of 95&#190; cents in 1877 and at 90 cents in
                    1876, we have aggregate gold value in 1877 of $595,000,000, against $586,800,000
                    in 1876, and this with an almost standstill of the trade with the interior
                    during a large part of the last six weeks. There is a decline in the aggregate
                    amount of breadstuffs received in this city during the year, as compared with
                    last year; the decline in the number of bushels (reducing flour to wheat) is
                    3,128,566 bushels, the receipts in 1877 amounting to 94,606,916 bushels, against
                    97,736,482 bushels in 1876. The decline in value of the receipts of produce is
                    largely due to the falling off in the number and the price of hogs, for which
                    the extraordinary weather of December is largely responsible. In 1876 we
                    received 4,190,006 hogs, and, despite the mud and the warm weather of December,
                    we received in 1877 no less than 4,026,600 hogs, a falling off of only 163,406,
                    but the prices were so much lower than those of 1876 that the difference in the
                    total value of the hogs and their manufactures is nearly $25,000,000. A large
                    falling off in aggregate values is to be found in the iron trade, where the

                        wholesale trade; the brick manufacture is counted a second time in the cost
                        of buildings; packing boxes and cooperage manufactures are again included in

                    <p>These figures show a total shrinkage of 4.7 per cent, as compared with 1876.
                        This is on a currency basis. But the value of the paper dollar has averaged
                        not far from 6 per cent higher, as measured against gold; so that we have an
                        actual increase of above 1 per cent in the value of our trade and commerce,
                        calculated on a specie basis. Reckoning in gold we have:

                    <p>It should be observed that we have omitted a great many things which would
                        largely swell the totals. Our item of "miscellaneous" in produce is the sum
                        of sales in hay, poultry, game, eggs, cheese, apples, beans, and hops, the
                        receipts of which are stated elsewhere. The total does not include the sales
                        of produce on the street, from first hands, as dressed hogs, oats, milk, and
                        vegetables, to say nothing of the ice-supply, which is a large business of
                        itself. If we should add in these things, with the sales of real estate,
                        include the retail trade, and swell the aggregate by taking in the vast
                        volume of speculative trading on 'Change, the sales of mining stocks, and
                        the dealing in privileges, we might make a much more imposing array of
                        figures, but not to so good a purpose. As stated in our last annual review,
                        we might roughly place the total at $7,000,000,000, or nearly $6.00 worth of
                        trading for every man, woman, and child on the surface of the globe.</p>
