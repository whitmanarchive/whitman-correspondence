          <reg>received</reg>
        </choice> your letter of Tuesday, (as I wrote Wednesday)&#8212;I will write a few lines to
          Lillie,<ptr target="tex.00338_n1"/> (mostly for Aunt Sally Mead)<ptr target="tex.00338_n2"
        />&#8212;</p>

      <p>I got a good letter from Jeff<ptr target="n0710"/> yesterday<ptr target="tex.00338_n3"/>&#8212;Mother, Jeff is
        evidently feeling composed &amp; well&#8212;of course he feels Matty's<ptr target="n0707"/> death very seriously,
        but I think he has recovered from the shock, and attends to his business as well as
        ever&#8212;They seem to be well situated at the Buckley's&#8212;Jeff writes quite a good
        deal about you&#8212;he writes about Mat's death&#8212;about her wishing to see us before
        she died&#8212;</p>

      <p>I am writing this seated at my desk in the office&#8212;I come over to the office about
        12&#8212;I do not feel very well, most of the time, but have spells when I feel much better,
        generally evening&#8212;I think the sun affects me&#8212;</p>

      <p>Mother, we&#8212;I and the doctor&#8212;have talked much of the electric battery
          treatment<ptr target="tex.00338_n4"/>&#8212;but as long as the head is affected, (the
        brain &amp; nerves) they say it must not be applied, for it will do more harm than good,
        might cause convulsions&#8212;My doctor, Dr. Drinkard, says he will use it as soon as he
        feels it will do good&#8212;but the time has not come yet&#8212;I believe I told you I am
        taking iron, strychnia &amp; quinine to give strength&#8212;</p>

      <p>I wrote to Jeff yesterday&#8212;I send you Harper's Weekly<ptr target="n0290"/>, <choice>
          <orig>to-day</orig>
          <reg>today</reg>
        </choice>, mother, it is quite interesting&#8212;I still hold my mind about getting a house
        here &amp; <hi rend="italic">shall certainly do so</hi><ptr target="tex.00338_n5"/>&#8212;At
        present my great hope is to get well, to get so I can walk, &amp; have some use of my
        limbs&#8212;I can write, pretty well, and my mind is clear, but I cannot walk a block, &amp;
        have no power to do any thing, in lifting or moving any thing in my room, or at my
        desk&#8212;Still I keep good spirits, better far than I would have supposed myself, knowing
        that I shall get all right in time&#8212;I know <hi rend="italic">how much worse</hi> things
        might be in my situation than they are, &amp; feel thankful enough that they are as well as
        they are&#8212;Mother, I was glad to get your letter of Tuesday, April 1. I have been
        reading the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> April 1st<ptr target="tex.00338_n6"
        />&#8212;I think it the saddest thing I ever read&#8212;</p>

      <p>Well, mama dear, I will close&#8212;I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday&#8212;Love to
        you, dear mother, &amp; to all&#8212;it is now about &#189; past 1 Friday afternoon&#8212;I
        wrote to you Wednesday 2d April, which I suppose you got. </p>
