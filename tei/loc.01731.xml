                <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have taken the liberty to send you by this post a copy of Mr. Swinburne's new book
                upon <hi rend="underline">William Blake</hi>, poet and artist&#8212;a great but
                neglected genius who was counted as a madman by his contemporaries here sixty years
                ago. As Mr. Swinburne makes mention of yourself in this, his most recent published
                composition, it is but right that you should see what is said. But irrespective of
                that I feel assured&#8212;from what Mr. M. D. Conway tells me&#8212;that the book
                will interest you.</p>
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01731.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            <p>Mr Conway will have told you of our intention to publish an English edition of your
                "poems"&#8212;or rather a <hi rend="underline">"selection"</hi> from
                them&#8212;edited by Mr. W. M. Rossetti, one of our most able critics, and himself a
                poet. In about a week I shall send you a copy by post. It makes a handy vol. of
                about 440 pages, &amp; will I think be a <choice>
                    <orig>favourite</orig>
                    <reg>favorite</reg>
                </choice> here. Mr. Rossetti's introduction is most admirable, and gives great
                satisfaction to your admirers and his friends.</p>
            <p>Now, we want the privilege of selling copies of this "selection" in 
                <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01731.003.jpg" type="recto"/> the United States&#8212;if you will allow us: and I have told Mr. Conway that I would give you&#8212;or your agent&#8212;a royalty of one shilling (or 25 cents gold) upon every copy
                sold in your country.</p>
            <p>I imagine that the sale of this "selection" in your country would serve as whet, or
                stimulant, to readers to secure copies of the <hi rend="underline">complete</hi>
                works. I really don't think it would materially interfere with the sale of the
                latter.</p>
            <p>On this English edition I will ask your acceptance of a share of our
                profits&#8212;after the original outlay in paper, printing, &amp; binding, has been
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="loc.01731.004.jpg" type="verso"/>returned to the
                publisher.</p>
            <p>I was greatly gratified this afternoon in having almost the <hi rend="underline"
                    >first</hi> copy of Mr. Robert Buchanan's new vol. of <hi rend="underline"
                    >"Essays"</hi> placed in my hands. I was <hi rend="underline">gratified</hi>
                because in the middle of the book his admirable paper upon your "poems&#8212;the
                article <choice><abbr>wch</abbr><expan>which</expan></choice> recently appeared in the <hi rend="underline">Broadway</hi>&#8212;is
                given.</p>
            <p>I think, in conclusion, that I ought to apologise for sending this familiarly written
                letter to you, as I am but a trader&#8212;a bookseller&#8212;and have only an
                acquaintance with your books of some years standing to offer as an excuse. True,
                the first copies imported into this country were at the order of the undersigned;
                but, that, it is feared, will not in any way palliate the liberty now taken.</p>
