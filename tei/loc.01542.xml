                <salute>Dear son,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>Your letter rec'd this morning, speaks of the mild weather there&#8212;but it has been &amp; remains 
                very cold here&#8212;so much so that I don't go around half as much as I would like. My cold hangs 
                on, though not so bad as at first. The state of the weather, &amp; my cold, &amp;c. have rather blocked 
                me from having my usual enjoyment here, so far&#8212;but I expect to make up for it by and by.
            </p> <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01542.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <p>Dear son, I see you are off<ptr target="loc.01542_n1"/>&#8212;I take it by your letter that you are feeling well in health, 
                and having as good a time as the law allows&#8212;I wish we could be together there, some of these
                moonlight nights&#8212;but here it is too cold for comfort&#8212;(the water pipes here froze again last night, 
                causing trouble)&#8212;I go out a couple of hours middle of the day, but keep in nights&#8212;
            </p>  <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="loc.01542.003_large.jpg" type="recto"/>
            
            <p>&#8212;I have got the new edition of my book under way,&#8212;&amp; it will be satisfactory I think&#8212;It will be in one volume, 
                &amp; will make a better appearance than any of the former ones&#8212;Do you go up to the debates in the Senate&#8212;I see by the papers they are having high times&#8212;Senator Schurz appears to come out ahead of them all&#8212;he is a real good speaker&#8212;I enjoy the way he shakes them up, (very much like a first-class 
                terrier in a pit, with a lot of rats)<ptr target="loc.01542_n2"/>

            <p>Pete, I send you $10 enclosed, as you may need it&#8212;Should you want more, you write, as I have plenty&#8212;I am writing this up in my back room, home&#8212;have had a nice breakfast of hot potatoes &amp; first-rate Oregon 
                salmon&#8212;with the best coffee thats made&#8212;home-made bread, &amp; sweet butter&#8212;every thing tip-top&#8212;get along well enough&#8212;you must try to do the same&#8212;so good bye, for this time, my own loving boy&#8212;
