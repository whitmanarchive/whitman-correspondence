                for it i hope i <choice><orig>shant</orig> <reg>shan't</reg></choice> get in such A
                <choice><orig>straet</orig> <reg>strait</reg></choice> again for a little change there
                seems to be so many little things you

                anything to get with) we are all well

                has got well again he eats so
                heartily and late that i tell him he
                will feel it when he grows older
                sis<ptr target="duk.00502_n3"/>
                is as fat as she can well be and

                i told hatty to day to not come down
                any more she is such a mischieveous
                girl i get up very early and that
                seems to be the only time i can get
                my work done but they will be
                older and i hope better one of these days
                Well Walt <choice><orig>georgee</orig><reg>George</reg></choice><ptr target="duk.00425_n2"/>

                over his quiet spell and seems
                like old times again i hope it <choice><orig>wont</orig> <reg>won't</reg></choice>

                what is the cause i thought of every
                thing i had said if i had said anything
                to give him reason but i <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> think
                i did any thing) he is getting along
                pretty well with his work they
                have got another job not very
                extensive a house to fit up in <choice><orig>warren st</orig> <reg>Warren St.</reg></choice>
                i <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> think they will make a great

                but it is only my surmise George
                <choice><orig>dont</orig> <reg>don't</reg></choice> say much about it they have
                taken up 1000 dollars and George says
                he has paid it all out but perhaps
                they will do better than i think)</p>

                i have left
                the dinner table standing to write this
                and will write to her as there is a lull
                in the young fry department i wish tha<unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#wr">t</unclear>
