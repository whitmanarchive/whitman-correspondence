                good deal lately, I have opened them &#38; read quite a good deal in them&#8212;they
                are queer books, the very finest of printing &#38; paper &#38; some odd pictures<ptr
                    target="loc.03901_n1"/>&#8212;I got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist
                yesterday&#8212;she is improving&#8212;the rest all well&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;We have had a rough hard winter, all around&#8212;Keeps me in mostly, but I make a
                dash out now &#38; then&#8212;I still keep pretty well this winter&#8212;if it
                hadn't been so cold I should have been down to see you&#8212;Ed how do you like
                being home again? But I think you are contented most any where&#8212;how is the
                nag? I was out once or twice sleighing&#8212;my brother took me&#8212;his mare
                Nelly is in fine condition&#8212;pretty lively&#8212;makes things fly

            <p>I have been in all day reading &#38; writing&#8212;I have put up two sets of my

                />&#8212;a very quiet day, but I have enjoyed it&#8212;outside it is cold and
                half-cloudy, not an inviting day out&#8212;</p>
            <p>&#8212;Well Mont have you found any chance yet at telegraphing? I think the best thing a
                fellow can do this weather, is to stay home &#38; keep warm,&#8212;but when the
                spring opens then make a dash somewhere&#8212;Van I suppose will make a
                farmer&#8212;well if he is satisfied, it is about as good as anything, I don't know
                but better&#8212;</p>
            <p>There comes my call to dinner, &#38; I shall go for it
                without delay &#38; finish my helter-skelter letter afterwards.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="underline">Dinner all right</hi>, baked beef pie&#8212;I am now going out to see one of the ferry men a friend, very sick,&#8212;I have
                provided a bottle of brandy to take him, as I understand the doctor orders milk
                punch&#8212;there is a good deal of sickness around here, much diphtheria&#8212;Well
                I must stop&#8212;Good bye &#38; Good bless you friends Susan, George, &#38; Harry
