            <p>Your letter to Herby was a real talk with you. I don't know why I punish myself by
                writing to you so seldom now, for indeed to be near you, even in that way would do
                me good&#8212;often &amp; often do I wish we were back in America near you. As I
                write this I am sitting to Herby for my portrait again&#8212;he has never satisfied
                himself yet: but this one seems coming on nicely&#8212;and so is the Consuelo
                picture. Another one he has in his mind is to be called "The tea-party," and
                it is to be the old group round our table in Philadelphia&#8212;you &amp; me and
                dear Bee &amp; Giddy &amp; himself. He thinks that what with memory &amp; photograph
                &amp; the studies he made when with you, he will be able to put you &amp; my darling
                on the canvas.</p>

            <p>Giddy's voice is developing into a really fine contralto &amp; she has the work in
                her to become an artist, I think &amp; will turn out one of the tortoises who
                outstrip the hares. Percy and Norah are spending the winter in London (at
                Kensington)&#8212;and we can get round by train in half an hour; so I often see
                them and the dear little man. Do you remember the Miss Chases&#8212;two pleasant
                maiden ladies who took tea with us once in Philadelphia &amp; talked about Sojourner
                Truth? One of the sisters is in London this winter &amp; has been several times
                to see us. The birds are beginning to sing very sweetly here&#8212;&amp; our room is
                full of the perfume of spring flowers&#8212;indoor ones. Did dear Bee tell you, in
                the long letter she once wrote you, how much she loved the Swiss ladies with whom
                she made her home while in Berne? A more tender &amp; beautiful love and sorrow
                than that with which they cherish the memory of her never grew in any heart. I think
                you will like to see some of their letters&#8212;please return them, for they are
                very precious to me (the little matters they thank me for are some of dear Bee's
                things which I sent them for tokens). Love to your sister &amp; brother. How are Mr.
                Marvin &amp; Mr. Burroughs? Best love from us all. Good-bye, dear
                Friend.</p>
