            <p>I don't know why I have delayed so long as a month to write to you, for your affectionate &amp; lively letter of September 5th gave me as much pleasure as I ever received from correspondence&#8212;I read it even yet &amp; have taken the liberty to show it to one or two persons I knew would be interested. Dear comrade, you must be assured that my heart is much with you in New York, &amp; with my other dear friends, your associates&#8212;&amp;, my dear, I wish you to excuse me to Fred Gray, &amp; to Perk, &amp; Ben Knower, for not yet writing to them, also to Charley Kingsley, should you see him&#8212;I am contemplating a tremendous letter to my dear comrade Frederickus, which will make up for deficiencies&#8212;my own comrade Fred, how I should like to see him &amp; have a good heart's time with him, &amp; a mild orgie, just for a basis, you know, for talk &amp; interchange of reminiscences &amp; the play of the quiet lambent electricity of real friendship&#8212;O Hugo, as my pen glides along writing these thoughts, I feel as if I could not delay coming right off to New York &amp; seeing you all, you &amp; Fred &amp; Bloom, &amp; every body&#8212;I want to see you, to be within hand's reach of you, &amp; hear your voices, even if only for one evening, for only three hours&#8212;I want to hear Perk's fiddle&#8212;I want to hear Perk himself, (&amp; I will humbly submit to drink to the Church of England)&#8212;I want to be with Bloom, (that wretched young man who I hear continually adorns himself outwardly, but I hear nothing of the interior &amp;c)<ptr target="loc.00795_n3"/> &amp; I want to see Charley Russell, &amp; if [when?] he is in N. Y. you see him I wish you to say that I sent him my love, particular, &amp; that he &amp; Fred &amp; Charles Chauncey remain a group of itself in the portrait-gallery of my heart &amp; mind yet &amp; forever&#8212;for so it happened for our dear times, when we first got acquainted, (we recked not of them as they passed,) were so good, so hearty, those friendship-times, our talk, our knitting together, it may be a whim, but I think nothing could be better or quieter &amp; more happy of the kind&#8212;&amp; is there any better kind in life's experiences?</p>
            <p>Dear comrade, I still live here as a hospital missionary after my own style, &amp; on my own hook&#8212;I go every day or night without fail to some of the great government hospitals&#8212;O the sad scenes I witness&#8212;scenes of death, anguish, the fevers, amputations, friendlessness, of hungering &amp; thirsting young hearts, for some loving presence&#8212;such noble young men as some of these wounded are&#8212;such endurance, such native decorum, such candor&#8212;I will confess to you, dear Hugo, that in some respects I find myself in my element amid these scenes&#8212;shall I not say to you that I find I supply often to some of these dear suffering boys in my presence &amp; magnetism that which nor doctors nor medicines nor skill nor any routine assistance can give?</p>
            <p>Dear Hugo, you must write to me often as you can, &amp; not delay it, your letters are very dear to me. Did you see my newspaper letter in N Y Times of Sunday Oct 4? About my dear comrade Bloom, is he still out in Pleasant Valley? Does he meet you often? Do you &amp; the fellows meet at Gray's or any where? O Hugo, I wish I could hear with you the current opera&#8212;I saw Devereux<ptr target="loc.00795_n4"/> in the N Y papers of Monday announced for that night, &amp; I knew in all probability you would be there&#8212;tell me how it goes, and about the principal singers&#8212;only dont run away with that theme, &amp; occupy too much of your letter with it&#8212;but tell me mainly about all my dear friends, &amp; every little personal item, &amp; what you all do, &amp; say &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am excellent well. I have cut my beard short, &amp; hair ditto: (all my acquaintances are in anger &amp; despair &amp; go about wringing their hands). My face is all tanned &amp; red. If the weather is moist or has been lately, or looks as if it thought of going to be, I perambulate this land in big army boots outside &amp; up to my knees. Then around my majestic brow, around my well-brimmed felt hat&#8212;a black &amp; gold cord with acorns. Altogether the effect is satisfactory. The guards as I enter or pass places often salute me. All of which I tell, as you will of course take pride in your friend's special &amp; expanding glory.</p>
         <p>Fritschy, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office, fifth story, by a window that overlooks all down the city, &amp; over &amp; down the beautiful Potomac, &amp; far across the hills &amp; shores for many a mile. We have had superb weather lately, yes for a month&#8212;it has just rained, so the dust is provided for, (that is the only thing I dread in Washington, the dust, I dont mind the mud). It is now between one &amp; two o'clock Thursday afternoon. I am much alone in this pleasant far-up room, as Major is absent sick, &amp; the clerk lays off a good deal. From three to five hours a day or night I go regularly among the sick, wounded, dying young men. I am enabled to give them things, food &amp;c. There are very few visitors, amateurs, now. It has become an old story. The suffering ones cling to me, poor children, very close. I think of coming to New York quite soon to stay perhaps three weeks, then sure return here.<ptr target="loc.00795_n100"/>
