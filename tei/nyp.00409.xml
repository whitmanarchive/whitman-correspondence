                <salute>Dear Hank</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>I hear from you indirectly once in a while by Hoag,<ptr target="nyp.00409_n1"/>
                (&#38; saw Debbie &#38; Jo<ptr target="nyp.00409_n2"/> some days since)&#8212;I
                suppose you got the postal I sent you about 12 days ago<ptr target="nyp.00409_n3"
                />&#8212;the weather has been so bad, or I should have come down&#8212;I have had
                quite a good deal to do writing&#8212;have finished quite a piece for a big magazine
                in N. Y.&#8212;the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>&#8212;it was
                ordered&#8212;I get $100 for it&#8212;I read the proof last night &#38; sent it
                    off<ptr target="nyp.00409_n4"/>&#8212;then I have a little poem <hi
                    rend="italic">the Patrol at Barnegat</hi> probably in next Harper's<ptr
                    target="nyp.00409_n5"/>&#8212;(but I think I told you about it)&#8212;then
                to-day I am busy on another order<ptr target="nyp.00409_n6"/>&#8212;So you see I
                have something to do&#8212;I will send you the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> piece
                when printed&#8212;I am feeling better and <hi rend="italic">sassier</hi> this
                winter so far than for some years, am very comfortable here, plain &#38; quiet
                though&#8212;eat my allowance every time&#8212;&amp; have a little jug of <hi
                    rend="italic">good Jamaica rum</hi> from which I take a sip now &#38;
                then&#8212;(but not very often)&#8212;came in chill'd &amp; dumpy late yesterday
                afternoon&#8212;made myself a good mug of hot rum, &amp; felt better&#8212;</p>

            <p>Hank, I hope you are having fair times on the road&#8212;I am glad you stick to
                it&#8212;perseverance will conquer. Horner<ptr target="nyp.00409_n7"/> was here
                again a few evenings ago, an hour&#8212;How do you get on with Col: Ingersoll's
                    book?<ptr target="nyp.00409_n8"/> (You mustn't take too much stock in
                him)&#8212;If there is any book particular you want, you tell me, &#38; I will try
                to get it&#8212;Lots of sleighs out, good sleighing&#8212;my brother was out day
                before yesterday, &#38; got overturned&#8212;I wanted to go yesterday, but he was
                afraid for me to venture it&#8212;his nag is pretty lively, (but I should have liked
                that all the better)&#8212;</p>

            <p>1&#189;&#8212;just had dinner, hot soup, cold roast beef, apple pie&#8212;all
                good&#8212;the sun is out real warm, &#38; I shall go at my piece for the N Y
                order&#8212;it is for a lady, a friend of mine&#8212;she has been for years
                principal literary editor of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, &#38; now she is
                going to start a paper of her own&#8212;pays me<ptr target="nyp.00409_n9"
                />&#8212;</p>

            <p>Is Ed<ptr target="nyp.00409_n10"/> home? I should just like to have a ten mile ride
                behind his nag with the sleigh bells&#8212;Dear boy, I send you my best love &#38;
                dont you forget it&#8212;</p>
