            <p>It is of no importance whether I had read Emerson before starting L. of G. or
                    not.<ptr target="med.00753_n1"/> The fact happens to be positively that I had
                <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. The basis and body and genesis of the L[eaves] differing I suppose from
                Em[erson]<ptr target="n1044"/> and many grandest poets and artists[&#8212;]was and is that I found and
                find everything in the <hi rend="italic">common concrete</hi>, the broadcast
                materials, the flesh, the common passions, the tangible and visible, etc., and in
                    <hi rend="italic">the average</hi>, and that I radiate, work from, these
                outward&#8212;or rather hardly wish to leave here but to remain and celebrate it
                all. Whatever the amount of this may be or not be, it is certainly <hi rend="italic">not Emersonian</hi>, 
                not <choice><orig>Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>, not Tennyson&#8212;indeed, the antipodes of
                E. and the others in essential respects. But I have not suggested or <choice><orig>exprest</orig><reg>expressed</reg></choice> myself
                well in my book unless I have in a sort included them and their sides and
                expressions too&#8212;as this orb the world means and includes all climes, all
                sorts, L. of G.'s word is <hi rend="italic">the body, including all</hi>, including
                the intellect and soul; E.'s word is mind (or intellect or soul).</p>
            
            <p>If I were to unbosom to you in the matter I should say that I never cared so very
                much for E.'s writings, prose or poems, but from his first personal visit and two
                hours with me (in Brooklyn in 1866 or '65?)<ptr target="med.00753_n2"/> I had a
                strange attachment and love for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and his contact, talk,
                company, magnetism. I welcomed <hi rend="italic">him</hi> deepest and
                always&#8212;yet it began and continued <hi rend="italic">on his part</hi>, quite
                entirely; <hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> always sought <hi rend="smallcaps">ME.</hi> We probably had a dozen (possibly twenty) of these
                meetings, talks, walks, etc.&#8212;some five or six times (sometimes New York,
                sometimes Boston) had good long dinners together. I was very happy&#8212;I don't
                think I was at my best with him&#8212;he always did most of the talking&#8212;I am
                sure he was happy too. That visit to me at Sanborn's, by E. and family, and the
                splendid formal-informal family dinner <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, next day,
                Sunday, Sept. 18, '81, by E., Mrs. E. and all, I consider not only a victor-event in
                my life,<ptr target="med.00753_n3"/> but it is an after-explanation of so much and
                offered as an apology, peace-offering, justification, of much that the world knows
                not of. My dear friend, I think I know R.W.E. better than anybody else knows
                him&#8212;and loved him in proportion, but quietly. Much was revealed to me.</p>
