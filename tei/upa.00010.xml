            <p>
                I wrote to your
                Quaker friends thanking
                them for the invitation
                for the 22d. I could not
                have gone in any case,
                my wife was ill in bed
                &amp; I had to go to Delaware

                <note type="editorial" resp="#ww" place="interlinear">Ursula (the wife)</note>
                Ursula was ill in N.Y.
                She had a relapse after
                returning home, &amp; has had
                a hard time,&#8212;ague, bron<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="upa.00010.002_large.jpg" type="verso"/>chitis, &amp; a gathering in her
                ear. She is better now &amp; is
                down stairs to-day for the
                first in nearly two weeks. My own
                health is nothing to brag of,
                I thought the trouble was
                with my nervous system,
                but the doctor finds it
                in my arterial; arteries
                hard &amp; brittle, danger
                from apoplexy &amp;c. Not
                a very cheering diagnosis
                tho', I may live to be
                hanged yet. I have
                given up eating meat
                &amp; have otherwise changed
                my habits&#8212;shall probably

                go out home in the spring
                &amp; spend the season on the
                old home farm. I seem
                to have felt a shadow creeping
                over me for some years,
                &amp; this is what it means.
                But I shall not lose heart:
                I shall try to gain some of your
                own cheerfulness &amp; serenity.
                I wish much I could see
                you. If you had only sent
                me word that day, I was
                on the point of coming over,
                but felt sure I should
                miss you if I did.

                I received your check for

                I hope you keep well. Is
                there any news from Boston

                sale of your poems?
