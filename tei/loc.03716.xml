            <p>In more than four years the parents of Clemens Petersen<!--<ptr target="n0780"/>--> have had no news from him. Have you
                seen his name in papers or periodicals? Perhaps he has died, and no friendly hand
                has been there to close his eyes or send information to Denmark. If

            <p>The young Norwegian poet Kristian Elster<!--<ptr target="n0216"/>--> died for some months ago just having
                finished the best book he ever wrote. He was a heart's ease growing in the shadow:
                the leaves are turning white from want of sun!</p>
            <p>The Icelandic poet Steingrimur Thorsteinsson<!--<ptr target="rlc.00018_n4"/>--> (Reikjavik, Iceland) takes great
                interest in your poems, as far as he has been acquainted with them. Forward a copy
                of "leaves of Grass" to him (via Leith) He is an old friend of mine.</p>

            <p>I have published a great volume of talks this autumn. But it would be too difficult to tell
                you anything about them.</p>
            <p>Your "Spirit that form'd this scene" is powerful and splendid. I shall translate it.
                The editor of "Illustreret
                Tidende" (our
                "Illustrated News") has declared himself willing to publish your image and biography
                as soon as there may be an occasion. Most probably the book of Mr Bucke<!--<ptr target="n0119"/>--> (London
                    Ontario) will
                turn out to be a good project. Has the book appeared? He promised to <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"
