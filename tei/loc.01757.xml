                <salute>Dear boy Pete,</salute>
            </opener>

            <p>My condition remains about the same&#8212;I don't get ahead any to notice&#8212;but I hold my own, as favorable as I have stated in my late letters,
                &amp; am free yet from the very confused spells of the head &amp; spasms of three weeks ago. 
                Besides I think upon the whole, my general strength is the best it has been yet&#8212;for an interval every now &amp; then it certainly is. All very encouraging&#8212;(But my disease seems to have such ups &amp; downs I have learned to fear to make 
                calculations, almost.) The weather here is fine&#8212;cool mornings &amp; nights, 
                indeed quite cold at times&#8212;but the bulk of the day perfect&#8212;I think the cool weather season is beneficial to me. I am sitting here 
                writing this with one of the windows wide open, &amp; the afternoon sun streaming in. 
                I got a letter this morning from Mr. Eldridge that he <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="loc.01757.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
                
                
                
                had paid Godey, 
                my substitute, the money I sent on for his October pay.&#8212;</p>
            
            <p>Washington must be looking pleasant this fall. Write me how you are fixed, 
                and I like to hear all the particulars about your work, on the RR.</p>
               <closer><salute>Good bye for this time, my loving boy.</salute><signed>Walt.</signed></closer>

            <div1 type="section">
                <p>It is now a little after 2&#8212;I have had my dinner, beefsteak &amp; <choice><sic>potatos</sic><corr>potatoes</corr></choice>&#8212;pumpkin pie &amp; a cup of tea&#8212;Don't you think that is doing very well?&#8212;It is a glorious afternoon &amp; I am going down to take a trip once or twice 
                    across the Delaware in the ferry boat. It makes a pleasant little trip as 
                    the river here is most as wide as the Potomac from 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> st. wharf&#8212;has two little islands in the middle, which sometimes we steer between, 
                    &amp; sometimes go round&#8212;Then <hi rend="underline">these nights</hi> 
                    Pete&#8212;last night I was out, came home about 8&#8212;the moon shining 
                    bright as silver&#8212;I thought of our old walks, dear son.
