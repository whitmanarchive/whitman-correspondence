        <salute>My dear friends John and 'Sula Burroughs,</salute>
      </opener>

      <p>I am here again in Camden, stopping awhile, with the intention, as soon as I can move with comfort, of getting to the sea-side&#8212;probably Atlantic City<ptr target="yal.00235_n1"/>&#8212;about an hour &amp; three quarters from here, by rail&#8212;I am not much different from when I saw you last&#8212;have been a good deal worse, (by spells, several of them)&#8212;but have now brought round again to where I was six or eight weeks ago.</p>
      
      <p>Mother<ptr target="n0705"/> died here on the 23d of May&#8212;I stood it all better than I would have expected. I returned to Washington about nine days afterwards&#8212;but I was very restless &amp; dissatisfied there&#8212;staid about a couple of weeks&#8212;obtained two months leave of absence, &amp; (after almost making up my mind to go into quarters at a Hospital, as boarder, but was persuaded out of it)&#8212;here I am &amp; have been for about two weeks&#8212;(I think comparatively better the last two days)&#8212;occupying the rooms in which my mother died&#8212;waiting for time to restore my health, which I still think it will&#8212;but I feel that the blank in life &amp; heart left by the death of my mother is what will never to me be filled&#8212;</p>
      
      <p>I am comfortably fixed here, have great kindness&#8212;I try to compose myself to writing at some of my themes, already outlined, but it don't amount to much yet. 'Sula, O how I wish you was near-by keeping house&#8212;I should consider it such a privilege to hobble there for an hour or two every day, while I am in this condition&#8212;The last nine or ten days in Washington, I left my den on 15th, &amp; visited the Ashton's on K st. &amp; lived there.</p>
      
      <p>John, I don't think I have any news either of Washington, or of literary affairs or persons, to tell you, nor have I heard any thing since from abroad. Love to you &amp; 'Sula. I hope you will write me soon, and spread yourself about gossip, about self &amp; 'Sula, and the place &amp; every thing&#8212;a letter written when you are in the mood, &amp; let your pen run&#8212;I depend much on letters, as I am tied up here, &amp; it is pretty lonesome.<ptr target="yal.00235_n2"/></p>
